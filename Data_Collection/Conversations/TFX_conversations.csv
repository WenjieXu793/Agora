"@contangoX thank you kindly. In fact it is included - just put into ""investment"" i.e. CapEx, intangibles, acquisitions + NWC. This is from the article [you can check it out at point (3) under the heading ""Business economics""]. ""note: owner earnings is defined at post-tax earnings, plus depreciation + amortization, less investments made each year (inc. NWC)].""The 'investments made' includes all capital allocations â€“ CapEx, etc. as above.Hope that adds some colour. Thank you once again and have a terrific week.",2024-08-28
