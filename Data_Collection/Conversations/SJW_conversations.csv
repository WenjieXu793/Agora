"@TimNeuman  I can understand your fear.  But it seems not based in facts.  According to Zacks, “SJW has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.05%”.  Combined with the data in this article, the evidence suggests that the commie regulators of the PRC are allowing SJW pretty decent returns.",2024-08-31
@mschwarzman Yes commies have to drink water; but they don't necessarily believe that they have to pay for it. A regulated utility in the People's Republic of California? Pass,2024-08-31
Brad is right on with SJW. I also like WTRG in this sector. Water utilities have historically grown by acquisition of smaller municipally owned water companies as well as organic growth. The only part of SJW that is somewhat iffy is the concentration of revenue in California and their regulators. Although even commies have to drink water.,2024-08-31
"In general, as a retired conservative investor I agree --- dull-normal investments are the most reliably gainful. For thrills in life, best realize some dividends, interest, and/or capital gains, a portion of which to allot for such pursuits. A former paratrooper at our church still goes skydiving at age 88.  I skipped all my chances to train for that, and instead am grounded (yok) in satisfaction and enjoyment from road trips with my wife, most of all. A friend of ours, formerly a broke gambling spendthrift, now channels his lust for risk and gain into ... dividend investing!  Whereas before he ""couldn't"" stretch his teacher's salary the full month without loans from his best friends (us), now he invests half of take- home after 10% into the district's 403(b) plan.  See, whatever anyone's specific motivation to invest or whence derived, it's all for the better to place money in ownership of income- paying shares.  Myself as a former expert in strategic MISuses of money and credit now takes pleasure, after each grocery trip, in whisking the unspent part of our budget right into savings.  On a recent 12-day sea cruise my wife and I spent less than $30 on shipboard amenities by not wasting time at the lounge or casino.  Almost everything we desired was part of the booking. Saving is not investing, but do it avidly and you'll get ahead on periodic bills, stay better prepared for unplanned setbacks, AND find leftover cash to reinvest!  At that, what thrill compares with doing better than you planned or expected?Great Saturday everyone, and thanks for reading!",2024-08-31
