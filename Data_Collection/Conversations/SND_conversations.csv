"@Steve Zachritz Our thoughts from last night:SND announces inaugural return of capital campaignSND announced a 10 cent special dividend (implied yield of 5% if it's a one time event),SND announced a $10 mm  (about 13% of current market cap),Favorite Quote Watch: """"We are excited to return value to our stockholders through this initial special dividend,"" said Charles Young, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. ""Our consistent focus on reducing costs, maintaining low leverage levels and increasing operational efficiency has provided us with the opportunity to declare this special dividend and to initiate this share buyback program. We plan to continue to be diligent in pursuing our long term goals of low leverage levels, sufficient levels of liquidity and positive free cash flow generation along with looking to return value to our stockholders opportunistically going forward.""Nutshell:As we wrote with the update piece here mid August a dividend was expected although we expected it to come with the call in November. We just didn't know what form it would take and honestly expected something smaller with a Base and Variable component (I had argued against a variable compent with the CFO after the 2Q24 call so obviously he didn't agree with my reasoning as we went full on the other direction)Nevertheless this is a promise delivered and speaks well to their confidence level as they look at the rest of the year and 2025.The buyback is icing on top and should improve shareholder sentiment.The balance sheet will remain strong in the wake of the dividend.The name has been trading at exceedling cheap multiples.At $2 SND trades at TEV/EBITDA of 1.7x nand 1.5x for 2024 and 2025 respectively. This is far below AESI in the sand space (which admittedly is in a different scale ballpark) but also well below the pressure pumpers who are closer to 2.5 to 3.5x.  We see this as too low and management has for a long time as well and these return of capital steps are meant to help address the issue.We own SND as our 2nd largest holding and have a $2.04 cost (excluding the dividend).",2024-10-04
