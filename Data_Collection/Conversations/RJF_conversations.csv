@Albert Anthony I do and it looks like Florida & Texas are becoming the beneficiaries of these High Tax States.,2024-09-15
"@Wall59 you make an interesting point.  Do you think there will continue to be an exodus to what some consider business-friendly, 0 state income tax states?",2024-09-14
RJF is also attractive as a Take Over Target because of their Corporate Headquarters being located in Florida. There are several Financial Institutions in New York that are considering leaving because of the High Taxes and poorly run City Governance. New York is  just not business friendly and RJF made the smart decision many years ago to relocate to Florida.,2024-09-13
@Albert Anthony That is a wide open question. I have heard others mention Stifel might be a good match. Now that Tom James has mostly retired except for his position on the board….maybe RJF would be more open to a competitive offer from a major player!,2024-09-11
@Sane Man I absolutely agree….RJF in my opinion has matured into a Prime Takeover Target!,2024-09-11
