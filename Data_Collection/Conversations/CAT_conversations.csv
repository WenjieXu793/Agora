@Kirk Spano In order to get back to better there may be some resistance but that bit of resistance is far better for the future than the destruction we are seeing now.,2024-10-02
@boris gudonov Every one of these investment firms have a list. Maybe they're pitching their book. They want you to buy the price up! ;-),2024-10-02
"@golfcat1 we ought to control the border, but, we ought to be issuing enough work visas and green cards to offset Boomer retirements. That requires millions of immigrants per year.",2024-10-01
"@Triton240 could very well be. In my note to subscribers today, I charted MOO, which I bought not long ago. Deere (DE) is biggest holding. Same idea. Good observation!",2024-10-01
"I know the valuation of CAT is definitely elevated here but can't help but think the incredible damage done by Hurricane Helene in Florida, Georgia, Carolinas and Tennessee is tantamount to a Black Swan Event and is going to require a tremendous number of Caterpillar bulldozers and other construction equipment during cleanup and repair!  Should have positive impact on Lowes and Home Depot and other supply  companies while negatively impacting insurance companies.  I would bet you could come up with a more comprehensive list of companies that stand to gain from this horrible and tragic storm.",2024-10-01
@santlo It won't. Markets will tank if the weird guys take over. They are a threat to democracy and capitalism.,2024-09-30
"@erbrown Don’t bet the farm on that. I don’t see cap gain tax on unrealized gains. For openers, evaluations are impossible, not only for the likes of farm land but also for 1000 shares of a publicly-traded stock, liquidity is a big deal. Then there’s the velue of the local family business. Not so fast.",2024-09-29
Stock Market at record levels under Biden-Harris …why will change  to Trump be better for market?,2024-09-29
"@bioland_888 long term to me is about the total portfolio. Individual positions are all rentals until proven otherwise. So far so good with CAT, but I'd cut and run and look to return some other time if the chart breaks down. That's my guiding light.Thanks for reading and commenting.",2024-09-26
@SUE2 The EU is slowing down dramatically and these China stimulus packages never play out long term.  The world is slowing meanwhile you have CAT at ATHs.  GL,2024-09-26
"Agree completely with the author. This nation has so much more to do urgently to finish replacing our aging and long neglected infrastructure, from our roads and bridges to our 100 year old antique electric grid. The work that was enabled by Congress passing historic acts to provide funding for both in 2022, when we had a House that was focused on improving America, instead of the toddlers in control today, who virtually wasted the past 2 years in blind pursuit of their own power instead, is only the beginning of all the work that must be done.I believe that America will sober up, step back from the brink of total chaos and elect adults who will focus on this nation’s needs. We will see more funding for replacing the worn out bridges, accelerating the replacement of fossil fuels with renewables, even as we massively increase our GW capacity to satisfy massive data centers and the reshoring of our CHIPS industries. CAT will be integral to getting the vital work done. This is part of my sleep well at night portfolio and it will be for the long run. We’ve got important work to do and I believe we’re finally going to get serious and get it done.",2024-09-22
"@SUE2 ""An American WORKER produces more than four times what a Chinese WORKER does?""usa products & services are far overpriced.compare McDonalds prices and wages in Shanghai, Hong Kong & San Francisco as the prices are comparable or cheaper in China.but business is 8x busier in Shanghai and the workers earn pittiance 4600rmb/m 2016 and under 13000HKD/m in HK 2020. where Berkeley earns 2023 entry level $18/h.food isn't better in Berkeley than HK. Who deserves less productivity. workers in HK and more so in Shanghai & Beijing are over 8x busier.November 2020, HK living was 85% of Jan 2021, San Mateo living that is PPP!",2024-09-19
@SUE2 not hate my nation.1997 Shanghai was 40years behind sister city San Francisco.2015 Shanghai had complete social transformation & 30 years ahead of SF BayArea.2024. No improvements actually worse social conditions in USA,2024-09-19
"@solidvalue you are right, i underestimated.  it is gonna get so much worse.  the MIC is getting the rights to build 2400 f 35s at 190 million per, and they don't even work, slow junk with junk weapons that the russians would not even taken an application for, so primitive, short ranged, unreliable and laughably inaccurate and inept....but the con goes on.......what an absurdity, that and the titanic debt snowballing towards us.",2024-09-18
"@bluescorpion0 you have the mainstream media take on things Geopolitical and financial.  Let's agree to disagree.  buy gold and the producing miners today a tremendous buy, see Paul Franke's most recent and other SA articles, a national investing champ btw. U R welcome",2024-09-18
"@bluescorpion0 no.  having 7 trillion in outlays and 4.6 trillion in revenues and printing the difference or borrowing the difference annually is crazy.  With the debt now going ballistically out of control, that is crazy. The party forever crowd and borrow forever government have pushed the country over the cliff.  And there is nothing the citizens can do about it.   40 million illegals is crazy.  A new military spending bill is factoring in 2 trillion on a new F35 production plan of roughly 190 million per F 35 yet produced, for jets that have been proven not to even work, with technologies 20+ years old (outdated), is crazy.  70 percent of the F35's already made to date, for a borrowed outlay of well in excess of 1 trillion dollars, where 7 of 10 cannot be flown due to so many defects, is crazy......the country is over.  The nutjob americans bombing the russian mainland, is crazy, where Russia has nuclear delivery systems that are 15 to 35 years more advanced than america's, that is crazy.  Their weapons seem like magic to the american military and the weapons corporations.  We only have theories of how they work, because if we knew how they worked, we would have them ourselves.   That is crazy",2024-09-17
"@panzer Servicing our $35 Trillion in National Debt is more like $1.1 Trilliona year ($3 Billion a day) and rapidly growing, much more than the $2 Billion a day we spend on National Defense.",2024-09-17
@slodon28 of course it will - just ask Milton Friedman. Spending leads to inflation (Why I sold any bond holding/ blended fund before 2022). Don't make this so hard.,2024-09-16
@TJ Burke Wont all of that NEW that government spending increase inflation?,2024-09-16
Spending will take off again under Harris. All her initiatives require new spending. It's objective reality and your lack of policy awareness or shallow partisanship does not change it.,2024-09-15
