"@magichr ''reducing subscriber churn'''I believe that the subscriber churn will slow down sooner or later.There was a massive influx when everyone was at home. But that influx will end in the next twelve months of so.I don't expect you to see things from my perspective, but getting 2.8 million subscribers to your platform isn't easy.",2024-09-30
"@beach_trader and I quote:NYSJ I get your point, but there's no way stock based comp ""does not matter"". More shares will most likely be created - my ownership percentage shrinks.This was your topic of interest not mine and now it does not matter. I have been in exchanges like this before. To summarize from an accounting source specializing in SBC:“So far, we have described the GAAP accounting treatment of stock based compensation.  In practice, many analysts actually ignore the stock based compensation expense entirely when calculating EPS  or when calculating EBITDA or when valuing companies . We discuss the wisdom of these approaches separately in those individual articles.”Hope this helps",2024-09-28
@NYSJ Its only going up cause Einhorn bought some. The company is still failing. I don't think buying Peloton and shorting tesla is a good strategy long term but people think Einhorn is a genius on this. We will see. I just don't see it either.,2024-09-28
"@Michael Wiggins De Oliveira They have 700m in cash left with 2b in debt and they wont be profitable next year. They could run out of money by end of next year and the competition is only going to increase. Bodi only has 25m in debt and 69% gross margins last quarter. Your better off getting bodi. Adjusted EBITDA2 was $4.9 million compared to a loss of $4.8 million in the prior year period .Free cash flow was $5.3 million compared to $(19.4) million in the prior year period. And the market cap is 40m while Peloton is 1.8b. CFO Elizabeth Coddington also sold 56,084 Shares of Peloton in august then in september sold another 57k shares. Its like waving a white flag.",2024-09-28
@Michael Wiggins De Oliveira interest is not coming down significantly maybe ever again. You are not getting 0% interest rates ever again unless the US wants hyper inflation. We are lucky if we see interest rates come down to 3%. But I think sits around 4% for a long time if they want to get it to 2% inflation. You are just not being realistic when they are determined to get to 2% inflation.,2024-09-28
@Jeremy Blum Its to late for peloton. They tried and after Barry Mccarthy quit in may you can just stick a fork in them. There is no coming back except bankruptcy. It is just a bad business model and the competitors have under cut their fees. There is no point. Its basically turning into the myspace of online fitness at this point I just don't see a real way for them to ever bounce back. I drove by 24hr fitness at 12 am few days ago to my shock the entire parking lot was packed. Going back to the gym was not a phase to get out of the house for a little bit its a good way for people to be around other people without having to dress up for a club. Online fitness looks like it will continue to decline.,2024-09-28
Peloton is a terrible investment. They are going to go bankrupt eventually. Everyone I know with peloton machine is now collecting dust or used as clothes rack cause they can't get rid of it. Main reason to stay away from Peloton is they face uncertainty about reducing subscriber churn and more declines in subscriptions and hardware sales,2024-09-28
@beach_trader and I can believe you don’t even understand it. So my question to you given what I have posted intellectually and fact based where  am i wrong. Non- GAAP exist. I have stated clearly the flaws in the accounting. Stated my experience and history. And you’re wasting your time??? I tried,2024-09-27
@beach_trader lol  hilarious. So why do you think the sell side looks at non- GAAP and amateurs keep on digging into GAAP. Before 2004 non-GAAP did not exist. I can do this all day long Current accounting system has so many flaws I can write a book on this. Non-GAAP!!!!,2024-09-27
@beach_trader respectfully you can disagree but to my point there is absolutely NO WAY to calculate what’s “fully diluted “. It’s math not emotional. As is said I was part of this discussion and it’s flawed. So I am curious based on what I posted which factual. How do you correct the mathematical flaws?To repeat: FASB requires companies to expense equity… all equity issued including options RSUs… even though they may never be converted. Regarding SPACs i agree but we are on a PTON board not a SPAC. I agree re: SPAC but again PTON is not a SPAC,2024-09-27
"@NYSJ disagree - anyone who buys a stock without looking at what awaits them at full dilution is looking at problem. I don't care about normal stock or option grants, but SPACs and plenty of other unusual financing can create difficult situations. Ask half the investors who bought SYM because it looked like it was cheap on EV to sales basis and half the financial sites had wrong information",2024-09-27
"@beach_trader Hmm my point is the only real number is shares outstanding NOT fully diluted. Shares are only  ""created"" when and employee exercises that right. So dilution only happens when employee or executive exercises that right to convert. If you choose to speculate sure it might matter more when SBC goes up and the stock is down. But let me be clear there is no way to tell what's been issued in options or RSUs vs what's been converted hence dilution. The accounting method has flaws and  we pointed that out to FASB. Politics is all I can say. So if you are looking at shares outstanding that is a great metric no doubt. But GAAP  vs not non-GAAP requires a company to account for total shares issued although not converted  which means they have to account for SBC.IMO shares outstanding (non-gaap) is the correct metric no doubt.",2024-09-27
"@NYSJ I get your point, but there's no way stock based comp ""does not matter"". More shares will most likely be created - my ownership percentage shrinks. The share count rises small enough each quarter/each year, that the stock price move is swamped by the actual business results of the company, and a few percent dilution gets lost, and basically no one cares much, and of course if options in the money, usually means stock went up.",2024-09-27
"@beach_trader You are spot on re: subscriber growth but I will say SBC does not matter. Why?  A little history. I was part of a group working for  a big bank back in 2004 that presented to FASB on why SBC accounting methodology was flawed. FASB was at that time pondering how companies should account for stock base comp. We argued that requiring company to report ""fully diluted"" of GAAP as we call it today was  erroneous. Why?Example: Lets say PTON issues 300 million dollars of SBC at 25 with a 5 year vest. FASB requires PTON to take that as an exp. Stock never sees 25 again, they lay off hundreds of employees that of course are underwater  and never convert RSUs or options to stock yet company is still required to report on a fully diluted basis. There is no recaptured or true up accounting. There is a certain % (unknown) of SBC comp that never converts to real equity. It is non-transferable. Employee dies? still on the books. Employees gets terminated  Still on the books.Long story short this is why non-gaap exist today. But to your point. No Sub growth. Sure stock may go up 10-20% but I am looking for 2-3x",2024-09-27
@Michael Wiggins De Oliveira I have posted a clear investment thesis many times ( more than I can remember) why I bought and why I sold. Trust then verify.If you care go back and look. Up to you. I believe i even posted here as well. Been there done that.,2024-09-27
@NYSJ ''Ended up being right.Simple as that.''OK... that's a very strong thesis.,2024-09-27
@beach_trader if I’m looking for entertainment I’ll watch Netflix I’m searching for Alpha.,2024-09-27
@Michael Wiggins De Oliveira I clearly understand that they are not that same and whether you owned it or not is irrelevant. Your analysis via CF and the underlying equity making a good investment is very similar. My point then and now is if there is no growth catalyst then there is no reason to own the equity.  As I said before I did own PTON when it was growing and sold because i strongly felt that the growth rate was not sustainable. Ended up being right.Simple as that.Best of luck,2024-09-27
@NYSJ YEXT and PTON are not the sameI didn't own YEXT.,2024-09-27
