@MySami it will be greatly reduced if Pooh decides to invade Taiwan. I think Putins disaster in Ukraine is giving him second thoughts.,2024-10-05
@123semi It's not in Putin's interest for him to unilaterally pull out of the Ukraine at this time..The West will have to offer Putin a plausible off ramp dealthat will allow Putin a reason to quit fighting.Putin has control of approx 20% of the Ukraine land mass.Most of it he has controlled since 2014.  Perhaps the best time to have seriously negotiated with Putin would have been 8 years ago...? As it stands now its absolutely fantasy to think Putin willexit the whole of Ukraine without Zelensky giving up someterritory to get a deal done.,2024-10-05

"@MySami really. Russia is already facing massive labor shortages amd inflation because of the lack of working age men. Drafted, fled the country or dead. You need to study Russian demographics. They are in big trouble.",2024-10-04

@SUE2 yes and the free world has decided to support Ukraine against fascist Russias invasion. And the Russian people are paying a terrible price for Putins ego. A terrible price. Will he continue to drive Russia to utter destruction for nothing.,2024-09-27
"Seeking alpha is so lame, who reports a dividend increase of the wrong amount?",2024-09-27
"It's actually a 4.63% increase because it's being raised to $1.13 a quarter, not $1.16 listed here.""CHARLOTTE, N.C., Sept. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved an increase in the company's regular annual cash dividend from $4.32 to $4.52 per share. The increase will be effective starting with the fourth-quarter dividend of $1.13 per share, which was declared today, and is payable on December 6, 2024, out of surplus to holders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2024.""",2024-09-27
"Stagflation…“As Russia's GDP and inflation figures move in the wrong direction, the worst-case scenario for any economy looms large over Moscow.""There are signs of cooling domestic demand. However, there is no reduction in inflationary pressure,"" Russia's central bank said in a summary of its latest policy meeting, translated by Bloomberg.”",2024-09-27
"@StreptopeliaTurtur yes this is about rebuilding the Russian empire which equals putins ego. What has Russia accomplished for all this death and destruction. And you forget one thing in your equation. Wars have to be paid for! A few years in Afghanistan bankrupted the ussr and Russia has lost about 10x men, equipment etc in Ukraine. Plus now Russia itself is being bombed everyday. If this is what the Russian people want so be it.",2024-09-26
Ukraine is not capable of defending Kursk on a long term basis,2024-09-24
"@123semi Maybe, but look at what happened with nazi Germany. How much suffering until Germany was destroyed. This would have been avoided if the US, France and the UK had reacted early, and built a war economy. History is repeating and a lot of useless suffering, including the destruction of Ukraine, is going to happen until Russia is ultimately defeated. The weakness of the US and Europe will bring war in other parts of the world too. Iran is pushing its pawns, and China will follow. It's just depressing to see how the US is sending a few weapons to Ukraine in order to absolve itself, but is preventing Ukraine from acquiring efficient weapons and from using them efficiently. Very much the same in the Middle-East, where the US are sending aircraft carriers in order to prevent Israel from coping with Iran, instead of actively helping destroy the Iranian threat. These policies are allowing those regimes to get stronger and stronger and it will not end well.",2024-09-23
"@SuperPac Better overall growth prospects, less exposure to sensitive sectors? I haven't looked into $PH, so these are only guesses.",2024-09-23
@Deep Value Ideas ''the risk/expectation of at least a modest recession also weighs on sentiment''***********$PH is a multi-segment industrial too. The stock has grown 250% over the last 5 years and up 60% over the last 1 year. Why isn't PH being weighed down by the modest recession sentiment ? It's valuation is higher than $HON.,2024-09-23
"@SuperPac $HON came out of the pandemic quite a bit overvalued and I think the stock is growing - slowly but surely - into its valuation. It's still not a good value though, in my view. And of course the risk/expectation of at least a modest recession also weighs on sentiment.",2024-09-23
"@gutcheck You nailed it—HON is definitely in the early stages here. I couldn’t find any specific revenue figures from the company yet, only broad projections for the industry: $120–150 billion by 2030. But without concrete numbers, that could be a bit speculative. If you’re interested, check out this article for a deeper dive into their BESS projects (It looks like it was published today, so that's timely): www.powerinfotoday.com/... — the 6th section covers the projections. If you manage to find any hard data, let me know!",2024-09-22
