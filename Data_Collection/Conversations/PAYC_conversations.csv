"@Dividend Streamer, it was an interesting meeting. I don't think Paycom's product requires desperation quite yet, but maybe the process' in place might. The argument Beti is cannibalising because of re-runs is exaggerated. However, the lower price that Paycom charges for Beti is likely more of a headwind for the company. ADP and PAYX are both great companies, I think all can succeed in the market currently",2024-10-02
"@tbone Well, I would say I am a self-taught private investor with personal skills to think outside the box.A personal skill that seems to be becoming increasingly rare these days.Very pity actually.But I would never call myself a proven expert on this or that or anything else.Far from it.Unfortunately, you missed the opportunity to talk about the factual level of the $PAYC company, which is the real issue.In a public school or university, you would be said to have missed the topic and you would rightly get very bad grades.This ultimately leads to academic degrees being obtained that have an intrinsic value of a little more than zero.Of course, this is not particularly helpful as a pseudo-expert on the subject of fraud when creating credible comments.Do you feel addressed by your own statement?Yes, no, maybe?!But to each his own.However, you have put forward a somewhat interesting thesis.Are all experts possible and potential fraudsters?I would say the list of possible and potential fraudsters is really very very long.1.

"The Chad rant/lecture to employees certainly provides insight into his management style as well as the desperation at Paycom.  Easy to see why there has been turnover in the C suite.  Of course, a CEO occasionally needs to provide a firm hand in guiding the ship.  But Chad was scolding his employees and there is a certain immaturity in his approach.  Thanks for including a link to the recording in the article.I've never been impressed with Paycom's conference calls.  Very opaque and seemingly full of BS.  The explanation that Beti was cannibalizing their payroll redo fees was hogwash in my opinion.  Payroll redo is fairly uncommon and hardly a significant part of any payroll company's revenues.I'm long ADP and PAYX.  Feel pretty confident that competition from Paycom will not hurt these two.",2024-09-29
"PAYC invests in their own data centers whereas competitors source that out to 3rd parties. I think valuating this company on the basis of operating cash flow is more fair. In addition to moving internationally, they are also moving up market for bigger customers. They are clearly taking market share and there is no reason to believe this will not continue, especially with a differentiated product that works so well for the end customer, BETI. This my opinion of course, I enjoyed your article and learned a few new things on PAYC and the industry.",2024-09-28
"@Dividend Streamer Thanks for your comment! This is why I wrote that for non-conservative investors at the beginning of my article. On the other hand, it is important to distinguish between growth and stagnating stocks. This is clearly a growth stock and can be bought at fair value, but not primarily for conservative investors. When calculating fair value, it is worth bearing in mind that if, for example, this growth stock were to make the same calculation for the following year, the long-term outlook would most likely be unchanged, while profit generation would have increased by about 10% in one year. Then the 10-year growth expectation would probably be 10%, so even if the share price rose during that one year as a result of the annual result, it would probably also only come out at fair value next year, while the share price has also risen and that is the realistic case. I would also add that growth companies are an extra good option if they are below fair value on merit, this is much better than, for example, buying a stagnant share below fair value, as then you not only expect the valuation to rise but also expect the company to grow organically. That's a double effect. Thanks again for the line of thought. If it is not clear, feel free to write! :)",2024-09-27
"I’m not really sure you believe the stock is a buy even though you say it is. By your own calculations, it’s trading at fair value. Most investors would rate such a stock as a hold. Furthermore, you own no shares yourself.",2024-09-27
"@Dividend Streamer Thank you for your comment. You’re correct that the five-year growth rate was higher than the current forward rate, and investing is about future potential. However, I mentioned the five-year average P/E ratio to provide context. The current forward valuation represents a 65% discount to historical levels near 63x, which doesn’t imply it should be trading at that level now.While the forward growth rate is lower, PAYC’s projected growth still exceeds the sector average, indicating it remains a strong performer. This 65% discount to its historical P/E offers an attractive entry point, provided PAYC maintains solid growth. Even without aggressive double-digit growth predictions, the stock's current valuation makes it a compelling investment opportunity.",2024-09-25
"When making your valuation statement you said ""When compared to the five-year average P/E of 62.95x. The stock appears to be at a notable discount of approximately 65%.""But you fail to mention that the 5 year growth rate was substantially higher than the current growth rate.  So of course, in hindsight it might appear that PAYC is undervalued based upon historical PE ratio.  Investing is about the future and when things change, a good investor adjusts.PAYC could certainly turn into a good investment if growth returns to solid double digits, but at the moment even the company doesn't seem to be making that prediction.",2024-09-25
"Paycom is expected to continue being a cash flow generator due to its strong revenue growth, which has consistently increased year-over-year, reaching $1.86 billion to $1.875 billion in 2024. The company maintains a high percentage of recurring revenue, representing 98% of total revenues.Additionally, Paycom's disciplined expense management and strategic investments in product enhancements and international expansion contribute to its robust financial performance.Lastly, Paycom's strong balance sheet, with significant cash reserves and no debt, further supports its ability to generate cash flow.Its Cash Return On Invested Capital (CROIC) of 21.8% ranks in the 91.2% percentile for the sector.The intrinsic value under the Base Case scenario is $242.30.Compared to the current market price of $173.72, Paycom is Undervalued by 28%.This results in a nice future total return potential.15.88% for growth return + 0.86% for dividend return + 0.60% for buyback return + 6.72% for 5y value return= wonderful 24.06% CAGR for total shareholder return potential.The stock does not deserve to be below the radar of most market participants.Long $PAYCOops!Well, sometimes such an obvious compounding machine is perhaps better off in the hands of just an appreciative minority.",2024-09-25
