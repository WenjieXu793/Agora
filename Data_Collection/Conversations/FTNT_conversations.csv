"I want to invest in $FTNT because I like their products. Additionally, I heard that their support team is top-notch. When FTNT will dip, I buy in. FTNT has a lot of VPN alternatives. SSL VPN is old tech (but required for many applications). It's been under attack, especially recently- and Fortinet has had to patch it like mad. Fortunately, $FTNT also has a zero trust network access (ZTNA) configuration option as well as SASE- so when traditional VPN starts to fade, FTNT will be ready to go into new challenges.",2024-09-28
"@Bohdan Vorona Relying on only one valuation metric to value a stock can be a huge mistake, which is why I use several. Next, Price to book is a terrible way to value a tech stock. The price to book is good for banks and insurance companies, but most analysts won't use it for tech stocks.",2024-09-16
"@TigerMoney In my opinion, Fortinet's debt is not that high.  I have seen companies in far worse positions. Even if you believe the company's debt is high, its cash and its cash flow can quickly pay it down if necesarry.",2024-09-16

LOL where do they think the US got all of its 200k+ of Bitcoin from in the first place.The US dollar is still the dominant currency in global illicit finance due to its widespread acceptance and relative stability. The physical nature of cash makes it attractive for activities like money laundering, tax evasion, and bribery. Estimates suggest that a significant portion of US currency in circulation, potentially up to a third, is unaccounted for and likely involved in illicit activities.   While Bitcoin offers a degree of anonymity and is often perceived as the currency of choice for criminals, its use in illicit activities has been declining.Blockchain analysis tools have made it increasingly difficult to use Bitcoin for illegal purposes without detection.Estimates indicate that less than 1% of Bitcoin transactions are associated with illicit activities, a considerably lower percentage than the estimated illicit use of US dollars.While both currencies are used in illegal activities abroad, the US dollar is still more widely used in illicit finance than Bitcoin.",2024-09-12

"@Herbert +H-Dog+ Kornfeld No, because it's untraceable, and therefore few if any authorities can track it back to an individual. Besides the point though; FTNT should be fine, it doesn't seem like it's a major breach.",2024-09-12

"@Michael Wiggins De Oliveira, FYI, I upgraded FTNT a day before earnings, and it's been at 38.5% change since then. seekingalpha.com/...",2024-09-11
Yup. The inventory drawdown is one of the biggest reasons to get bullish on $FTNT. Its always a forward sign of demand improving for the product revenue in the coming months. I just wrote about this exact piece yesterday:seekingalpha.com/...,2024-09-09
