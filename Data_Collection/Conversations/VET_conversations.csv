@Abcd8 You bought into a value trap that does not pay any reasonable dividend. Why else to hold a no growth E&P?  Management prefers to incinerate capital via buybacks that were all done well above the current market price. The market has spoken going 2 years now and it does not like it. Tremendous pain in here; all the pumpers who were cheerleading have gone super quiet. Put your money into TOU and enjoy real cash returns straight into your portfolio,2024-10-04
Why is VET going down today when the oil price and most producers are going up?,2024-10-04
"@HGIA3200 That dividend angered me more than anything. It was a nice $.17 a month. I didn't like the suspending of it, but they were going to pay down the debt and restore it. I'll help out. Then they come back with less than $.05 a quarter. There was a point it hit $30, I was tempted to sell, but thought we were out of the rough spot and things will be good, nope, another slide and more lies. Some people still believe in them, I wish them luck, but it's not for me.",2024-10-01
@upnorthwi well done! VET management never deliver on the ROC. Monthly dividend should have been reestablished. With this debt figures ROC must be 75% of FCF (they said this in a table quarters ago) and it is 33%...,2024-10-01
@Iron Eagle That's why I sold a year ago at $13.25 after holding a long time and listening to management promise the world and not deliver. What they did to the dividend was another deciding factor.,2024-09-30
"So if you loved it at $12.81, do you love it even more now?""But you cannot ignore the potential for double-digit returns in almost any scenario for VET and the 20% increase in dividends was a nice gesture by the company. ""It would seem that they are getting great value on their stock buybacks at these prices.I guess one of my key questions is... is European gas drilling good?  I mean, less transport to market obviously, but how does it compare profitability wise?It would have seemed that in 2022, they would have been drilling every well they could and increasing production incredibly, if the numbers pay out.  If they can't make great money at these prices now given the war in Ukraine, enough that they should be putting a well in every potential pad they have, then when will it pay off?Any perspective on the type of wells they are drilling?  Are they coal-bed methane (very long production) or fracking shale, or are they trying to find just big gassy pockets and stick a straw in it like a juice box?",2024-09-28
"@Valuemachine12 Maybe they make an acquisition, but they also have senior unsecured notes of 379m maturing next year.",2024-09-28

"@Bang For The Buck - But who is attracted to it? The share price can't even hold $10 when it was nearing $30 a couple years ago.  Who is buying? Institutional investors? Doubt it because this falls under the dirty oil and gas category, right? Lots are staying away for ESG reasons I believe. Traders? Doubt it because constant hedging limits profit potential.  The reason this went from single digits to near $30 was the prospect of all the profits the company would make on the European gas spikes a couple years ago.  Then European governments decided to take some shareholder money in the form of windfall taxes and VET became conservative and underperformed recently with too many hedging losses. Where is the windfall profit potential for day traders? There is none. So they stay away. Who is left? Dividend seekers? VET doesn't pay enough and some of that bunch won't touch oil and gas for ESG reasons. What do you have left? A small group of retail investors reading your SA article thinking they are buying into a great company at a low price?? How far will that move the needle?? We can talk about free cash flow and hedges that will eventually be profitable or anything else, but at the end of the day, where is the share price right now and what in reality is going to move it?? I have held VET shares for many years....extreme profit growth potential and trader greed was what moved this from single digits to near $30....hedging isn't going to replicate that unfortunately so I don't see a strong path forward for great returns for any shareholders entering now.  You might get decent returns, but who really wants 'decent'....? Mr. Market has answered that question via the current share price.",2024-09-22
"@Iron Eagle @Darp Research  The hedges Nuttall is likely referring to are the European natural gas hedges in 2024, which were made during the energy crisis at much higher levels. However, Vermilion has been pretty good with hedging its European natural gas production in 2025 and 2026, at relatively attractive level (but not as attractive as the hedges for 2024). So, when you consider the current energy prices, hedges for the next few years, and a decreasing share count. Vermilion continues to have one of the more attractive free cash flow yields going forward.",2024-09-21
@Darp Research - why are these jack@sses hedging anyway??? I can see when you have debt issues and lenders require it but why now? They are NOT in the same position financially as they were a few years ago.  Their share price is in the dumps all due to management who continue to collect royally themselves.,2024-09-20
"So Nuttall today said on bloomberg VET is cheap but hedges will not last forever.  There is another factor to that, maybe when they rolloff in 2026, VET will not need them, they are on a roll luck-wise, on hedges.  Cheers",2024-09-17
"I bought some Vermilion on this drop to 12 CDN, but if it goes up, I will sell some at different points.....U can't hold on too long to these oil stocks....or they will flop backdown.",2024-09-14
"@Abcd8 - the sentiment on this stock is rather negative at this time. Any acquisition will probably be met with more investor scorn. Investors want their share and VET management is not sharing enough. They need to severely ramp up dividend and dividend growth messages. Share buybacks don’t move the needle. They excessively hedge their European production to preserve their own skin and ensure they maintain their executive salaries and benefits long into the future. Shareholders get scraps. Until that sentiment changes, it may be hard to see a lot of upward stock price movement especially when some institutional investors seem to shy away from oil equities like this. However, I will say that this is not a bad buy in price range, as long as you are patient enough to wait and not expect much.",2024-09-14
@GettingPaidToWait Forgot to add US production which is 6000-7000 boe/d. I view US as non-core to VET and could be sold.,2024-09-13
"@Valuemachine12 Great comment!1. What is the data source for this ""140 mm CD in FCF per Q in 2025 (~550 annual).""?2. How would investors react to an acquisition in this market environment? Typically the share price goes down.3. What are the top 3 stocks that you follow and have the highest upside potential during the next couple of years?Thank you!",2024-09-13
"@Valuemachine12 ""The have built their cash position to approx. 270 mm CD by end of H1 2024 (+ 125 mm CD compared to end of 2023), hence they are likely preparing for an acquisition, probably the acreage buyout in Canada or something in Europe. Not sure. This is where most of the cash went that was not used for shareholder returns.""They will buy Coelacanth Energy ($CEI) of which they already own 20%. It is a Canadian Montney land play adjacent to their existing Montney. EV is $400M so it would cost them $310M to but the remaining 80%. This will give them a pretty massive Montney position reveling the big players and will, IMO, solve the market's concerns of Reserve Life in Canada. They will need to develop their Montney land to build out the infrastructure however Europe throws off a lot of cash flow to do this without needing to rely on debt. They already have more land than they ever will need in Europe. No need for acquisitions there as they have been proving out European reserves through the exploration wells there (3000 boe/d in Germany and 2000 boe/d in Croatia). These are excellent results and will re-rate there European reserves.In 5 years, I can easily see VET as a 100-110k per day producer:- Canada production at 60,000 boe/d with Alberta Montney production grown to 20,000 - 30,000.- Europe production at 45,000 boe/d with growth coming from Germany and Croatia wells.- Australia at 5,000 boe/d",2024-09-13
"Let me explain for you.They make on average approx. 175 mm CD in FCF per Q in 2024 (~700 annual) and 140 mm CD in FCF per Q in 2025 (~550 annual).They have approx. 156 mm shares outstanding as of now.Using a current share price of ~12.50 CD, you get an annual dividend of ~3.8%. Annual payout is hence approx. 75 mm CD (~11% of 2024 FCF). They have been buying back varying amount of shares, but started spending 15-20 mm CD per month (~200 annually) on share buybacks after having reached their debt target. This will reduce the share count by 1 - 1.5 mm shares per month in the foreseeable future.The have built their cash position to approx. 270 mm CD by end of H1 2024 (+ 125 mm CD compared to end of 2023), hence they are likely preparing for an acquisition, probably the acreage buyout in Canada or something in Europe. Not sure. This is where most of the cash went that was not used for shareholder returns.Looking at the numbers, they will finish 2024 with approx. 150 mm outstanding shares. We will probably see a div. raise to 0.15/Q (+25%), targeting an annual dividend payout of 80-90 mm CD. This is nearly a 5% yield at today's price.The set-up is not outstanding, but also not bad. And it is predictable if European gas prices remain resilient (which I am a believer of). So you can decide whether this set-up has good enough risk/reward for you.I think a FCF yield of >25% (in 2025), a nearly 5% yield at current share price and a quite positive outlook (with current NA and CAD gas prices being at their lows, potential M&A and good share buyback pace) is not a bad deal. Best wishes.",2024-09-13
Vermilion Energy (TSE:VET) (NYSE:VET) had its price target lowered by analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. from C$18.00 to C$15.00.,2024-09-13
Can someone explain why VET is apparently generating huge free cash flows ? 25% and only paying ?3% divi and share purchases of ?1% or less per month? Where is the free cash flow going?,2024-09-12
