Altimmune (ALT) is another company that is preserving muscle mass with a similar weight loss drug.  Needs to get Phase 3 going I believe.,2024-10-06
$ATL is the solution same result but less lean body mass and less muscle lost,2024-10-06

"Please note in the article “Regenerom (REGN) is testing a drug called trevogrumab that blocks the hormone myostatin, preventing from limiting muscle growth”They are developing a muscle building drug…To combine with obesity Drugs A muscle building drug would tremendously benefit the elderly, who lose muscle mass with age A muscle building drug would help bedridden patients Are the objections as loud to this application of a life enhancing drug?If it also Induces weight loss because muscles burn more calories, should it be banned?Benefits now equal cost benefits later JMHO",2024-10-06
"@HPBunker Actually the two would be combined for initial weight loss, after weight loss, a low dose maintenance dose will likely be the end point Lilly is studying that now, in conjunction with long term benefits to weight loss resulting from using Zepbound The point being, obesity, now defined as 25 lbs overweight Not the 500 lbs person brought to mind by that termEventually brings on heart disease, diabetes, kidney failure, joint replacement etcIt’s better and cheaper to pay for obesity drugs than the above  JMHO",2024-10-06
"Eli Lilly sells Zepbound, two lowest doses) directly for about 400 $ a month The (shots with a needle!) are, in reality, an injector pen with microscopic needles, the patient does NOT even SEE a needle and barely feels it  Once a week is easier to remember than dailyPatients using Zepbound have had fewer side effects due to single dose device and stepped up one month regimen A single dose in one injector pen isn’t subject to the abuse of a pen and vial, the common way of getting off label untested compounded drugs off the internet (also Novo)Needles and vials allow impatient Patients to inject higher doses of Untested Compounded drugs which of course causes side effects  There’s no way Of knowing how Unhappy patients ATE or drank while using glp drigs Before criticizing weight loss drugs, please consider that Prescribed drugs cause over 100,000 deaths a year in the USA It’s likely that obesity causes Many More deaths a year than that… certainly more than deaths from tested, injected obesity drugs  A maintenance dose of tested obesity drugs, like a statin, will likely evolve as an effective way to retain weight loss  (Lilly is testing that now)The Puritan view that using drugs to enhance lifestyles should have died with the advent of ViagraJMHO",2024-10-06
Increasing muscle mass alone would burn calories  For older people who Lose Muscle As a Function of Age … Such a drug would be a huge benefit  A drug that would combine with glp drugs to prevent muscle loss would be wonderful With the advent of Viagra… the Puritan view that using drugs to enhance people’s lives should have had a stake driven through its heartThe health costs benefits flowing from weight loss compensate for the costs of the tested and approved drugs  Once weight loss is achieved… a maintenance dose to retain weight loss will likely be what evolves  Something akin to a statinJMHO,2024-10-06
"The GLP-1 drugs have many negatives, which is a key tailwind for Medifast's (MED) business. Again.MED's business has to do with healthy lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, that have PERMANENT results without side effects. Specifically, the negatives of the GLP-1 drugs are:1) The GLP-1 drugs do NOT manage weight through changes to one's lifestyle and behavior. As a result, patients who lost weight while on these medications gain the weight back once they stop taking them.2) The GLP-1 drugs have side effects, some of which are severe. Add this one mentioned above by REGN's CEO.3) The GLP-1 drugs do NOT come cheap. Specifically, based on GoodRx website, the annual use of Wegovy costs about $20K, and the annual use of Ozempic costs about $12K.4) Insurance will NOT cover the cost of the GLP-1 drugs in many cases. The reason is that the patient who seeks insurance coverage must prove that he has fulfilled many conditions required by the insurer and that the patient has made reasonable efforts to try other treatment methods or lifestyle changes prior to using them.5) The GLP-1 drugs are NOT available over the counter. They can only be given upon a prescription by a doctor, so if a person is NOT diabetic that individual should NOT be receiving any prescription to buy the medication.6) The GLP-1 drugs are INJECTABLE medications, meaning you inject a liquid medication with a needle and syringe, which is NOT convenient for many people.",2024-10-06
Food inflation creates weight loss. May be J Powell and his team should get the credit.,2024-10-06
@D_DAYTRADER It IS mind boggling....a P/E of 108x. That's a lot of expectational euphoria. I wonder which drug induces that.,2024-10-05
@daslkjflskdj  percentage gains of HIMS GLP-1 sales are next to nothing.    It's a joke to suggest that HIMS is stomping LLY.   You must be at an early happy hour.,2024-10-04
@CPA Bob technically the compounders have been stomping LLY based on growth in sales and market share. HIMS doesn’t sell LLY’s tirzepatide,2024-10-04
"@Jonnn12333 yea, it’s like amazon spending a lot to grow business in early years. HIMS should do $5 in EPS in 2026 so if we put 50x multiple that’s $250 share price. The spending declines as scale increases",2024-10-04
This will cause fewer drugs to be developed. I’ve heard something like 10-15% fewer. Government regulations have unintended consequences.,2024-10-04
i think the author confused 2 different GLP1s one of them is semaglutamide which HIMS is sellingthe other is another glp1 which the author is writing about and doesnt affect himsso you can buy the hims stocks again that you sold,2024-10-04

"@Bulls1 If the process were a true negotiation, I would have no problem with it. But the outcome is predetermined. Pharma companies will have no choice but to submit to whatever the government imposes on them.

"@nckadams I worked for many years at a large biotech company. I was a very lucky guy to get in early as a scientist working on new amazing drugs for people all over the world. I am now happily retired, but my opinion on drug prices in the United States has never changed. I know that R&D to bring a new drug to market is more than a billion dollars. I also know that drug companies constantly raise drug prices by obscenely high amounts. That is not fair to the average sick patient. Things will change for the better with Medicare having the right to negotiate drug prices, despite what overpaid pharma CEOs tell us.",2024-10-03
