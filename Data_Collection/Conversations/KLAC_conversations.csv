"@quickmio @quickmio I know yhet Qualcomm wants to borrow certain x86 ""microcode"" or whatever to mix with their Snapdragons to get the edge over the clone pack.Anotehr reason I think why Qualcomm is interested in Intel as whole or for the chip design division is that Qualcomm probably plan to develop Windows smartphones.  20 years ago  , x86 was too cumbersome and power hogging to use in personal digital assistants, (remember PDAs?).  Arm chips were power efficieint but not that powerful back then.  We pushed on  and Androids came . ARM exploded.Back then, we had 180 nm nodes     very weak chips   during the days of Pentium...  . ARMs were laughingstocks back then.Intel ignored smartphones but this doesnt mean Intel will never come back ot smartphones or PDAs  . We can forget PDAs.The reason for Windows phones is better connections wtih PCs that is not going to go away ..I have frustrations with my Androids working with my PCS for decades.I think Androids are just lame.Apple phones works well with Macs, dont they?  take a hint.. will ya?Intel and Qualcomm will merge and kick all the fabless Android clones out in the orbit with Elon Musk's satellites.",2024-10-05
"At the risk of getting more flannel from Star Investments for agreeing, in September 2020 I had an argument with a bear who believed Nvidia was just a chip company and no way worth 24 times revenue.Sorry if this is too obvious to be worth mentioning, but it's not a good idea to buy every stock that looks overvalued. While I've always believed that, it's been reinforced by buying expensive stocks that turned out to not have the secret sauce to justify the investment, making the BUYs look stupid with hindsight.",2024-10-04
"@Star Investments Yes, Damodaran fully understands that valuations are inexact. That's why he kept half his Nvidia stock. Why do you make agreeing with you such hard work?",2024-10-04
"@TigerMoney for sure, but they, just like AMAT, have a very different focus. And have other verticals with different (less dominant) competitors where it would be easier to take market share in my opinion.",2024-10-04
"@Mick Research I haven't deep-dived into ONTO, but they don't appear to be competing on all the different verticals, just some. More importantly, I think displacing any Wafer Fab Equipment maker is much harder than it seems at first; the large ones (ASML, AMAT, KLA, TEL, LRCX) often design fabs and develop chip production together with clients like TSM, INTC, MU, and Samsung. So the customer relationships these companies have are extremely close I think. I'm very bullish on KLA, so keep that in mind for everything I write :) But that's why I don't think any of the large WFE makers are easily replaced by a smaller company (1/11th the revenue), and also why I haven't taken the time to deep dive into the smaller ones like yet. But I might eventually!",2024-10-04
"@Mick Research companies like AMAT, Tokyo Electron, and Lam are very well diversified in the different production steps so they likely have competing solutions to at least some of KLAs offerings. But KLA has the only growing market share and over half the market as installed base, unlikely to be displaced in my opinion - especially with its kind of management!As Moneyball has pointed out ASML does do a bit of inspection too, but the same applies in my opinion.",2024-10-04
@Mick Research ASML is developing their own inspection equipment so they could pose a challenge.,2024-10-04
"Nice article, even though I am not sure KLAC is undervalued.Towards the end of your article you wrote ""But over the long term, I think there are companies in the semiconductor space that have a stronger moat than KLA.""What would those be? As far as I know, ASML, AMAT, etc. are not KLAC's direct competitors, are they?",2024-10-04
"@Mick Research, It's the perfect example. It shows that valuations are all about which time frame you use. A person may be right in the short term and wrong in the long term or vice versa. My reverse DCF calculation might conclude that KLAC is overvalued over a ten-year period. However, since the chip market is going into an upturn, it may be undervalued over two years.",2024-10-03
"@justaguy11 According to the article, ""Aggressive investors who buy stocks with short-term time horizons may want to buy KLA and hold it over the next year or two. "",Amazon's price declined over 80% in the following 2 years. Definitely not the right example :)",2024-10-03
@Mick Research Amazon was overvalued in 1999.  Was it smart to buy Amazon then?Yes or no.,2024-10-02
"@Michael Orwin, First, citing one example of Aswath Damodaran being ""right"" is completely meaningless. The point is that no one is God, and valuations don't give one 100% prescient god-like abilities.  Damodaran is often ""wrong,"" too, because no one has a valuation model that can perfectly predict the future.  Valuation models can be useful when a stock trades at extremes.  If a stock is extremely overvalued or undervalued, it MAY be a good time to buy or sell, but it may not be.  I remember when people called Amazon overvalued, and it outperformed for decades.  By the time some valuation models said it was an excellent time to buy Amazon, people relying on those valuation models missed many multibaggers.  They were wrong because, unlike some believe, VALUATION IS NOT A SCIENCE.  It can't do things like predict precisely where the moon will be in relation to the Earth ten years from now and be completely accurate. Valuation is an art form that can only give extremely rough approximations of what a stock MIGHT do over certain periods.The second thing an investor has to do is look at time frames.  It is completely possible to be ""right"" in the short term and wrong in the long term.  Alternatively, one can be ""wrong"" in the short term and right in the long term.  For instance, I use a ten-year DCF.  It's completely possible that my ten year DCF on KLA will be correct in ten years, but completely wrong over the next three years. Therefore both things can be true.  KLA can be a buy over the next three to five years but a poor investment over ten years or 15 years or 20 years.In most cases of people arguing over valuations, the two arguing are doing so over time frames, and they aren't conscious enough to understand that's what they are doing.  For instance, most analysts on the market that give price targets are doing so on a 12-month basis. It's possible that the analyst may look ""right"" over one year but ""wrong"" on a ten-year basis.  For that reason, it's also possible for me to recommend a stock based on the understanding that most cyclical stocks going into an upcycle will outperform in the near term.  KLA will likely outperform the market over the next two or three years.  KLA might even outperform the market for an investor who holds through two cycles and eventually sells eight years from now.  My DCF of ten years may then be right or wrong ten years from now.  The point is, everything is possible, and no one is a Paul ""Muad'Dib"" en.wikipedia.org/... that can perfectly 100% predict a stock's movements over different time frames.",2024-10-02

"@Star Investments In June 2023, Aswath Damodaran had a piece on Seeking Alpha where he valued Nvidia, with DCF models for base, optimistic and pessimistic cases. Even his optimistic case showed the stock was overvalued, and he said his assumptions were quite optimistic. He also said he'd sold half his NVDA holding. On the face of it, it was irrational to keep half, given his analysis, and that was the subject of some of the comments. Yet, it turned out to be a good decision. I've heard him say why he bought Uber, but I didn't know he said Uber was overvalued, so I won't speculate on whether or not he learned from his Uber valuation.",2024-10-02
"@Mick Research I will just say that valuations are just a mathematical model that attempts to assign a ""Value"" to whatever number the equation spits out.  I played around with enough mathematical models to understand that they fall very short of explaining what the future will look like.  It is extremely rare that I have seen a stock hit a price target in the time that the best analyst says. One of the best at valuation, Aswath Damodaran once valued Uber when the company first came public . He called it ""overvalued"" and he was terribly wrong: www.growth-catalyst.in/...That's when I learned to take valuations with a huge grain of salt.  I use valuations to guide my decisions but I also understand that sometimes they can be very wrong because every forward looking valuation out there makes assumptions about the future and those assumptions rarely play out exactly how many think. So, yes, I sometimes invest in overvalued stocks because sometimes, they defy people who think they can predict the future with 100% accuracy. Math works very well in sciences like thermodynamics, but valuation is not a science.   There are many other factors on why a stock goes up and down that valuations can't account for.  There are some undervalued stocks that never give investors a good return.  There are some overvalued stocks that give investors a great return for decades.  There are no perfect valuation systems that can spit out the correct answer every time.As for KLA, I am fairly certain that the stock will provide investors a decent return over the next two or three years because its a cyclical stock about to go into its upcycle..  Outside of two or three years , I am more uncertain.  However, long term investors can still buy it and monitor it closely  after two or three years. There is still a chance that KLA will outperform for up to five years, which is why I recommended a buy for long term investors also.",2024-10-02
@webchow I have seen it. While there is some truth behind it I still think is more of Qualcomm generating not enough revenue to sustain the acquisition,2024-10-02
"@Star Investments ""in a rising tide lift-all-boats scenario, KLA is likely to become more overvalued over the next several years.""This reminds me of $PYPL. It didn't end well, did it?",2024-10-02
"@webchow Missing the point if you have a good product with your IP and you improve it by wrapping it in another companies IP you can't be free of them and then they control your product.AMD reverse engineered the INTC chip still tied to INTC over that.AMD came up with 64 bit INTC had to license it, did not stop them from jerking AMD around for a decade.Handing INTC AMD's marketing plan and amount of production with release dates would be a disaster.",2024-10-02
"@RUBYRUBY3 Patents are Patents. Intel can reverse engineer anything. There's nothing that could be learned in manufacturing that couldn't be learned in the engineering department.
