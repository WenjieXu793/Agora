"@investor-quest Thank you, and yes, at least a year ago that seemed like the call to make. As for a ‘Sell’ downgrade rating today, I do have some reservations, despite the fact that almost all of the quant metrics scream to dump it. Without going into a deep dive, consider a few points: real estate is hard, but the company’s revs are up 23% to start the quarter, which is a lot better than the 5 % growth in the same quarter last year, and their year-over-year revenue decline was under 3%, the smallest decline since late 2022, suggesting things may be leveling out. Bigger property deals are ticking up, too, as institutional investors have returned post-pandemic slowdown: : MMI closed over 1,200 deals this quarter, totaling $7.2 billion in sales, so the company is still very much operational.For me, I’d probably avoid smacking it with a ""sell"" rating based on the fact that MMI’s financial health looks decent - no debt and $336 million in cash, and they’ve also been paying out dividends, buying back stock and it looks like there's another $0.25 dividend coming in October.There are other issues, of course, but without naming them one-by-one, I still think I’d have this at a hold rating...as a shareholder: maybe one finger resting over the sell button with a very close eye on the Fed and the real estate market. I hope this helps. By the way, I love the open approach to the ‘possibilities’: I’ve been doing this a long time and I don’t know everything (and get schooled from time- to-time by the subscribers in the comments – but I welcome that) so adopting an attitude that you’re wrong is very healthy/wise in my opinion for growing from the heart and wealth perspectives.",2024-09-14
"As things have played out over the last year, it is clear now that you made a good call in this article.  If you were to re-rate these guys today, what would you say?  I just looked at their numbers and I would call them a sell.  I don't understand how the price per share remains as elevated as it is.Two possibilities here:  1.  I just don't understand the business well enough, and I am wrong, or perhaps very wrong.  I think this is probably the way to bet.  ~80% likely.2.  I am correct.  ~ 20% likely.",2024-09-13
