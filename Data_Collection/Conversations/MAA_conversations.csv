"@odsmaker Dude, Thanks for the info, I'm aware of the government efforts and have seen it manifest, to some degree in my old hometown. In that case, it has been for-sale condos and townhomes, not apartments. Apartment markets are tight with very few exceptions. ESS mentioned Alameda and LA counties as being softer, otherwise very tight markets. It is still difficult to build apartments in these markets and still takes a lot of time to do so. It also has to make economic sense. ESS has not started anything new in quite awhile, nor has anyone else, to my knowledge. In the last conf call, they did not mention any new developments at all; it was brought up in Q&A and the reponse was that economics are better, but not good enough for new development. Acquisitions make more sense. The next conf call may well disclose commencement of new projects. If so, it will be interesting to see how long they take from tying up land to stabilization. I'd bet it will still be 3 years or more.ESS has made me a $hit ton of cash in the 30 years I've been invested. I have no qualms about the size of my position. Good luck to you!",2024-10-05
"@Arimnestos The California coast is always going to be a place people want to live, I hope. Even though apartment/condo supply is rapidly increasing, equilibrium will eventually occur. I'm sure you'll be fine. You'll be well within Buffet's first and second rule of investing. ESS is well run, I think.",2024-10-02
"@odsmaker I have held ESS since it's IPO, it is my largest reit position. I no longer live in the state, but do have property there and was in the apt development business in CA. I am not concerned.",2024-10-01
the short rate on maa.pri is too high to profit from this,2024-10-01
"@Arimnestos The changes in state law are dramatic. Local governments can no longer block developments or slow them down anywhere in the state. I would not recommend holding ESS until the dust settles, and that could take years. As a landlord myself, I am feeling the change directly.",2024-10-01
I tend to agree with the notion that Sunbelt markets will be soft for some time yet. MAA is priced richly at current levels; I trimmed my position recently. Also long ESS and AVB.,2024-09-28
"I sold MAA pfds. at $66.00 in 2021, because the over all yield was low, it has got even worse now, as TV pointed out.",2024-09-27
"Thanks for the assessment.  For largely the same reasons, would BSR REIT rate a sell at this point as well?",2024-09-27
Your March 4th buy recommendation for this stock is now up by 27% in a little over 6 months. Nicely done. Hopefully this recommendation will prove to be timely as well. Long MAA.,2024-09-19
"""A 'buy right and hold tight' strategy is likely a good fit for most investors, avoiding frequent trading and capital gains taxes.""Couldn't agree more but would have to second the sentiments of previous commenters that MAA is not where I would go to implement that strategy.",2024-09-19
The buy right time is over for Maa. Itâ€™s a meh investment going forward but I will continue to hold,2024-09-19
Very clear and comprehensive coverage of a top performing apartment reit. Thank you.,2024-09-18
