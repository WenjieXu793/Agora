"@threeleaves Thanks for the reply.  I have been studying up on etsy for the last few days.  I think the bear case boils down to negative gms, and the shorts figure it will get worse with the slowing macro, so there is a high short interest.  Revenue is up slightly but they can only squeeze so much out of each transaction, they need increasing gms, the 10-Q from mgmt says that.  The debt pile from m&a is unfortunate.  They talk a lot about their house of brands so hopefully future purchases will have better outcomes.  But they do own their vertical, so there is a moat.  And I can see the stock working out with a little macro help.I like ABNB a lot better though,,,,",2024-10-04
"@HardytheTrader those are not comparable businesses to Etsy. Of course there will always be losers. Those were VC backed flips - Selling equity to next owner based Rev multiples & rev growth at a loss. Etsy is a real business, clearly playing the long game w/ over a decade in proof of concept & a core focus on profitable growth. Did either of these platforms have 20% profit margins, and consistently? I understand some of the risks but have not seen any legitimate explanation other than slowing growth which is not uncommon when you have a cyclical retail business. Instititions also fading consumer discretionary at the moment, but that is opportunity for longer term invetsors",2024-09-21
"$ETSY is focussed on SMB that are not cost efficient. Now that the consumer is tightening not the best place to be. I have exited my investment long time ago. Their future is murky as reflected by the sky high short interest. I'd avoid this stock at this point, even if it got very cheapP.S. Many online marketplaces fail, see Farfetch and Wish",2024-09-20
"@threeleaves Sorry if I was not clear.. art & crafts are heavy and the shipping is expensive so when you factor this in, the only party that makes money is the shipping company and Etsy.  Etsy focuses on arts and crafts - this category is mostly bulky heavy items, this is the core of the problem.  If my wife made customized greeting cards, she could make a profit.",2024-09-20
"@ex institutional listed derivatives analyst You are basically describing all e-commerce platforms. Fees plus shipping. If you want to skip the fees, you drop the platform and pump money into marketing and everything else that the platform was giving you. But I agree , e-commerce in general is an extremely difficult business and often a race to the bottom. I think what differentiates Etsy is unique items. But some items are more unique and higher quality than others. Yes, bulky items are a problem with e-commerce. And I think provide somewhat of a moat for certain types of local businesses.",2024-09-20
@ex institutional listed derivatives analyst I have an artisan friend who has been on the platform for years and swears by it. She ships her stuff all over the world. If the items are unique  a premium gets placed on the item and shipping cost and fees get passed on to the buyer.Most “free shipping” gets factored into cost of item. Especially nowadays where people expect free shipping.,2024-09-19
"@Michael Wiggins De Oliveira I dont understand the comparison to GME considering Etsy is a real business generating +$700M in FCF, but I also did not understand why you are suggesting they retire their cheap debt, convertible mostly at prices 2-3x todays levels",2024-09-17
"@MUGSLEY 'This seems to be easy money for anyone with +3yr outlook. 'Maybe.I don't think so, but maybe it could become like GME. WHY NOT?",2024-09-16
"@Michael Wiggins De Oliveira They have $2B in convertible notes at <0.5% interest, convertible at share prices from $87 to $247 between 2026-2028. Today the EV is +$7.5B and they have +10x net DSCR. This is an incredible capital advantage, so I see no reason why you would recommend they should pay this down? In terms of valuation, Etsy is fighting a consumer spending slowdown. This is a cyclical business trading at trough multiple and near trough eps. I would suggest taking a longer term view. This seems to be easy money for anyone with +3yr outlook. I would also highlight the AMZN threat was  disproven 6-7 yrs ago. They are low cost sellers, similar to TEMU & Shein. The unique products and network of sellers Etsy has is durable and should be able to withstand an economic turnaround. The only thing I don't like with Etsy is the continuous excessive stock compensation",2024-09-16
"I have shopped with ETSY  and had some great experiences but we own shares for the day I wake up and the news says  "" AMZN to buy ETSY ""  As we all know the company being bought out the shares skyrocket . Patience is key here .",2024-09-16
$POOL is starting to get interesting. Adding it to my watch list.,2024-09-15
"Many sellers on ETSY are individuals like my wife who sold arts & crafts.  Unless you can sell high-ticket items the fees and shipping charges become a large percentage of the costs.  She tried for several years but gave up.  The other issue is that the buyers on Etsy are not volume buyers, they don't return to you for additional purchases.  It's like eBay where most people don't buy from individuals unless it's a firesale but worse than eBay as it at least has established larger merchants.",2024-09-15
PARA shorts should be covering this month. There is no point shorting it as the absolute floor is 7.5 and you can't squeeze blood out of a tulip.,2024-09-14
Not sure why a value/divvy/high moat company like IP is doing on a short list.  Looks like a losing bet,2024-09-14

"@threeleaves I find it crazy that I could see the bubble in resale, but they couldn't. I guess I'm a little cynical which saves me from losing money. Obviously, I've never become a CEO of a billion $$ company either.",2024-09-14
"@William T. Warden Just pull up a 10 year on revenue and tell me again the company isn't growing. A pause in growth and people think the company is toast and there are no levers in growth. Shortsighted in my opinion. The lever is a two sided market place in a niche area that just gets bigger and bigger due to network effect. I love companies that investors hate because it means nobody wants to get into the business, which allows moats to be built. That's exactly what happened and is still happening with ABNB. Investors have always hated the business, and now 14 years later they are basically the bigger sibling in a duopoly that is all but cemented due to regulations on short term rentals. I see big margin of safety here. You really don't even need much growth here to do well. All they need to do here is grow profitability. Print money and use it  to buy back stock. Wait for the next pop in revenue growth and all the shorts get squeezed into oblivion as earnings go exponential due to buybacks. I think this is a 3 to 5 year play. 5 years stock is $200.I agree with author, the real killer was the debop deal. I'm honestly surprised that the CEO didn't get axed for that one. What an absolute decimation of hard earned value. Stock should probably trade at a discount for the sole reason of atrocious capital allocation by management.",2024-09-13
"@William T. Warden Yeah I agree. I'm not buying. Definitely on my watchlist, but I'm big into medical devices.",2024-09-12
"@Alex Pitti Yeah, as you pointed out that has not worked very well.  I suppose the best strategy is the one they are employing, improve operations, perfect the model and when the macro improves then earnings will be up strongly.  Sell puts, buy stock and work on building a position.  Are you a buyer?",2024-09-12
@William T. Warden Etsy isn't going to move outside of homemade hand picked items if that's what you want.,2024-09-12
