"@Bobbie B Thanks. The comparison is of ""Total Return.""Here is how I understand it. Total Return = Price Return + Sum of all dividends paid on the way.I am not sure, if they can calculate TR with reinvested dividends into the same fund.As a tiny business owner,  I like ""working capital to grow from dividends."" The only inventory I house is the fund itself. But, it must reflect itself in working capital growth not its erosion.",2024-10-05
@Cadus Compared the growth of the SP500 when taking out 10% per year fro income.,2024-10-05
@hafen Thank you very much. Most prudent advice. We will implement your lived experience.,2024-10-04
"@Cadus I’m 84. Figure out your needs/wants, see how much that takes of your income. Go from there. I retired 11 years ago, I reinvest all distributions; then, I take our social security and a given amount from our investment income. I set that number 11 years ago, it was what we needed and wanted. We did allow an additional $12,000 per year for real estate taxes on our home. We’ve never taken that additional money for real estate taxes, it wasn’t necessary. What we take from stock income is about 1/4 of our stock income. We live well, but not lavishly. We give some $ to each of our 2 adult daughters each year. What we take is less than 4%. See what you need and want. Go from there. I am not wealthy, but this is a very good life.",2024-10-04
"Hey guys thanks. I am on the Cusp of 65 and this fruit tree getting pruned each month is worrying me. My friends who have already retired are suggesting to take 4% of capital for living as opposed to harvesting dividends. So, perhaps 50% dividends and 50% index harvesting may be more prudent? Any thoughts?",2024-10-04
"@rickevantodd I agree, I would be happy with a 10% dividend, with stable to upward moving principal. In this case, Bain Capital's NAV has dropped nearly 10% in the past 6 years, NAV fairly flat the past 4.On my watch list.I currently have Main, Arrc, and Fdus, all less than 1 year",2024-10-04
"@Cadus With all due respect, comparing a BDC to the S&P 500 is an apple vs orange. Granted, some BDC’s exceed the total return of the S&P, however, they are primarily an income vehicle vs growth. I would happily accept a 10% covered yield on my income assets and, quite frankly, accept the same return on my entire portfolio if inflation adjusted over the long-term.",2024-10-04
"""Despite dividend hikes, the BDC's net asset value grew, and the stock trades at a 6% NAV discount, presenting a favorable risk/reward.""1. Bain capital has missed earnings estimate.2. It's worthless as a long term investment.Total return of SP500 over past 5 years is 109% and BCSF is 56%. The proof is in the pudding.",2024-10-04
