"@Tudor Invest Holdings The analysis mentions a Y/Y outlook for total returns. HSBC's profile isn't well set-up for the banking industry's current market environment, you want EU IBD-centric banks, for now. Wealth, private banking, and investment management can set a base for IBD activity, NII will be a severe problem in the next year as banks shorten duration (deposits will drag, so they'll have to), lose valuation on mortgages, and enhance provisions for credit.Then the simplified argument, EU IBD-centric banks are at massive P/B discounts with good D Yields.",2024-10-01
"Thanks for the coverage of HSBC. In the summary, you mentioned that the total returns paints a different picture. This depends on what time frame you look at. Nevertheless, I do get your point. Over 5 years the share price of HSBC was up 21.5%, which compared to say JPM at 84% is rather low. This is probably not a total return. The gap would narrow somewhat if we look at the higher yield from HSBC. Asia-focused shares have been trailing the mighty U.S. stock market for many years.  Maybe it will change. There is an old saying that goes like this:""Every dog will have its day""",2024-10-01
I like the HSBC strategy of divesting from low growth / no growth regions of the world and increasing investments in the East. The only problem is that its implementation is not fast enough.,2024-09-23
Stock price will go up as the IB stars (if there are any left at the Bank) walk out.  Beautiful timing of this leak.  Just before bonus numbers start to be discussed,2024-09-09
