"@builderscott Agree and also am a USAA policy holder for auto, home and umbrella liability. Every year I run the numbers using on line comparison apps. LMND has not popped up as competitive in my market - PA in any of these annual searches. Nor using their App does it do better than competitors. Another reason I buy puts when LMND breeches $20 / share. I bought two batches Oct and Nov. When I hit target ie $ 1,000 I closed Oct. Nov getting close but may pause on closing given the chance market may break lower - Election, Inflation not totally under control yet, hurricanes, etc.",2024-10-08 12:25:11.452835
"@OCDnerd Actually, playing the guilt by association card is totally irrelevant. The business arrangement with BNP only tells you that LMND can write insurance in France. That's it.What you should ask is why are they wasting their time in France? If you know anything about the French market, it is dominated by AXA and AGF and the bancassurance model. LMND will have to reserve capital for that market, independent of the US. This complicates managing the balance sheet, which they are systematically destroying.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"Let's cut to the bottom line.LMND has no viable business model. After all this time their combined ratio, the only metric that really matter, is uncompetitive. Spare everyone the AI will do magical things when it hasn't to date and is not unique. Their competitors are massively more technologically sophisticated and have a huge data advantage.Growth, for a unprofitable insurance company is a pathway to death.You cannot build a viable business off of renters insurance. Sorry, the premiums are just to small per policy.Also, adjusted EBITDA is not a thing -- its a nonsensical distraction.",2024-09-27 00:00:00.000000
"If LMND is successful implementing his plan, the stock could trade much higher that 1-2x tangible book value. For example, KNSL and PLMR are two high growth profitable insurance companies trading at about 10x and 5x tangible book value respectively.I agree that the company might have problem writing business in 2-3 years. However, it’s not obvious. The regulatory surplus of the insurance company subsidiaries at 200 million (see 10-Q Q2 2024) is much more than its current capital requirements. Therefore, with a consolidated book value of 630 million, there is still plenty of cash to be burned to support writing business. As mentioned by the management, a combination of reinsurance/captive can also help. When profitable (in 2027 according to management) the surplus to support growth issue should not longer be a problem.I believe LMND can create value much more than the current stock price if it can achieve its long-term objectives (loss ratio below 70%, industry leading expense ratio, and growth at 20-25%). If not, indeed the stock could plummet. I am bullish on LMND although it’s a high-risk investment.",2024-09-11 00:00:00.000000
