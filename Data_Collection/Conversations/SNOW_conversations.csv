"Product seems to be great (at least according to my student how interned in a company that uses the product). However, if quality is the standard, Microsoft would have no business in cloud.",2024-10-06
There's no future in this company if the executives keep diluting the shares.. it now has 335M shares outstanding. The executives are enriching themselves at the expense of the shareholders.. I suspect they want the outstanding shares to get to at least 1.5B shares,2024-10-06
"This stock fair value is $145-160 Product is absolutely phenomenal and sticky. Data Infra once set up, it’s very hard to replace and takes months to migrate. All the clients who have migrated their data on snowflake will pay higher over the upcoming years even if the price per query remains the same because of the growing data year over year. Consumption model is complete stranger to many investors but it’s a no brainer strategy who has worked with data & AI. Companies don’t delete data just because it was 2 years old btw! For comparison in layman terms:Data is goldmine, clean data is the gold . Snowflake is the miner",2024-10-06
SNOW yes this is an ugly chart several failed accumulations all while under the red down trend. Would have to climb $10 for chance at breakout now.Daily Target $104stockcharts.com/...SNOW weekly target $79stockcharts.com/...,2024-10-06
@Natturner1966 I agree but aren’t you concerned about their recent capital allocation decision?,2024-10-05
"Yes, it’s been a dog  and unwanted. But I made money on it when it when over $200. I took that house money and invested some of it back in for the eventual turn around. PLTR was a dog for a long time, I stuck with that one and look how it’s done since. Not every stock will be an overnight sensation.",2024-10-05
"Everyone talks about it, but it doesn’t always happen. Then when it does happen, you’re never sure how long it will last.Or how many inches you’re going to get.(I am talking about snow, not s-ex).Had Sold-High $SNOW in Feb, 2024 at $215, only to get sucked in Buy-Low at $125.x again. A Trade @Juxtaposed Ideas",2024-10-05
"a lot of outdated data, here. 52 week low was 107, like 2 weeks ago. Outstanding shares also grew to 335",2024-10-05
"With a (somewhat surprising) sub 1 beta of SNOW (https://finbox.com/NYSE:SNOW) and its equal weight rating and PT, it means we should expect an extreme market run up in the next 12 months [sarcasm]",2024-10-05
It’s not a strong buy with 50% upside?  Quite a call to be “equal weight” ,2024-10-04
Let tax loss selling begin for the remaining sheep----Wait for $50,2024-10-03
SNOW is an excellent company but it's facing formidable and strengthening competition from Microsoft Fabric and Databricks. It's multi-cloud capability will keep it competitive for awhile but it's a narrow moat that is draining gradually.,2024-10-02
As long as they keep maintaining ~30% growth (28-32% range) then I’ll keep buying until market understands this company. IMO it’s stupid cheap and will get re-rates very quickly.,2024-10-02
"""Patience you must have, my young Padawan""  This will take time for it to get its legs back.",2024-10-01
"Not all the debt is used for buy back, 2/3 of the 2 B SNOW is raising will be used for acquisitions. Also buy back at this price is not a bad idea",2024-10-01
"@InvestOrSwim It's always the lead products drive a customer satisfaction, then customer retention and revenue growth.   Hope we can see more analytics on product leadership among Snowflake and it's competitors.",2024-10-01

"No amount of technicals in the world will end this downtrend, it will need to be a fundamental event (earnings) or macro event like a change in narrative.  I’m still long and will stay long. Once the narrative changes I don’t want to be chasing. Then we can start talking technicals again.",2024-09-28
@InvestorMan Sr.  retail investors have lost interest in the markets overall. It’s that time of year. Especially on anything not making new highs daily. Snowflake will be fine.,2024-09-28
"Strength is building on the toilet this am . Kidding aside , they most likely will be acquired by one of the hyperscalers , IE Google Cloud . Databricks is eating Snowflake for lunch , but is attractive 110-111 for a 1/4 to a 1/3 of a position .",2024-09-28
