"@CR Spencer to be fair, Aurora is a subsidiary.Aurora is known for drones and adding automated flight to existing aircraft.Aurora has never designed a full sized aircraft, nor one that carries passengers.Virgin Galactic was desperate to find anyone to take on the task with the cost and timeframes.I suspect that they were attempting to reverse engineer WK2. What is telling about this issue is that for a year, VG continued to claim the work was ""on target"" Then in the lawsuit, it is detailled work stopped 13 months prior.Just like attempting to reverse engineer SS3...Its only a matter of time before VG is forced to actually reveal the progress on Delta, other than 'on target""",2024-10-04
"It's so easy to kick someone when they're down. Especially when they deserve it! Full disclosure; I lost a whole lot of money owning SPCE, Virgin Galactic stock. Companies are in tough situations when they need to contract with their competitors to build their equipment. Of course Boeing is now known for doing a poor job designing its 737 Max airliners and its Starlliner Space capsule. Perhaps they are just too addicted to costPlus contracts. We should all realize the dangers of having entrenched bureaucracies. Virgin Galactic one seemed to have a whole lot more potential but it's wrangling with Boeing  and the problems with its Mothership carrier have diminished it's reputation. Those problems certainly influenced its decision to sell a major assembly plant to RocketLabs.Good luck to all those buying SPCE stock these days, you are getting it at a much better price than I paid.",2024-10-04
