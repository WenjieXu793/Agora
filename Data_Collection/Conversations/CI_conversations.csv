@lbeachmike That's a fair point. Year-to-date net interest expense was $86 million. Looks like the bulk of long-term debt is financed in the 3% to 4% range per page 14 of 61 of the Q2 2024 10-Q filing.,2024-10-04
"@Kody's Dividends I don't think this is the case with Cigna, due to the heavy debt load. So lower rates should be more favorable for servicing the debt. I would think this outweighs any premium investments, but I don't know the terms on their debt.",2024-10-04
"@NextGenInvest I like ELV alongside UNH, CI. It was HUM's steep drop that stood out yesterday. NOW we know why!!!Humana crashes as members on top-rated Medicare plans dropHUM -20%.",2024-10-02
@Chris Lau I like UNH and CI. What are your thoughts on $ELV as well?,2024-10-02
@MichaelW_R the parent companies have a 1 or 2 or 3% margin and there are some tech components and venture capital pieces.,2024-10-02
@grizz64 Seems like a mess at the moment. I'm not adding to my position.,2024-10-01

"@Gentleman Argentum Thanks for sharing your thoughts on CI.As far as higher interest rates are concerned, you are correct that there is a benefit to CI's business model.Though, net investment income was only about 0.5% of total revenue in the first half of 2024. So, the benefit is rather minimal.",2024-09-28
"It is getting difficult to find stocks that are not overpriced in today's market. Cigna certainly has maintained its value glamor. Earlier this year, I sold around $336 but might pop back in for another ride into 2025. I have always felt that Cigna was the best choice among the major medical insurers, for investors that is.Question for the analyst - being that Cigna is in the insurance business, am I mistaken to assume they make more money when rates are high (via investing the insurance premiums that their customers pay), and that rate cuts reduce their margin?",2024-09-28
"@Brad Thomas @fairmountcreek No, that's correct. The forward yield is currently 1.6% rounded ($5.60 annualized dividend per share divided by $346 share price = 1.62% yield).",2024-09-27
"Several  large lawsuits against it, which some consider a normal aspect of the business. Latest is by FTC about insulin pricing.",2024-09-26
I like the company a lot but really sold out of my position. It has ran up quite a bit in the last 16 months so another pullback is overdue (and perhaps ongoing),2024-09-26
"Cigna is nothing less than a must-own investment.Cigna is a promising investment for the next few years due to its strong financial performance and growth prospects.The company has consistently delivered revenue growth, with total revenue reaching $60.5 billion in Q2 2024, representing a 25% year-over-year increase.Additionally, Cigna's focus on innovative healthcare solutions, such as the EnCircleRx program and biosimilar drug offerings, positions it well to capitalize on emerging trends in the healthcare industry.The company's commitment to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends further enhances its investment appeal.Cigna Corp's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 8.3% already ranks in the 86.7% percentile for the sector with still plenty of room for improvement.The stock is very good value based on its 5y PEGY ratio of only 0.81, which clearly indicates a strong buy rating.Long $CINothing creates more wealth than investing in excellent quality compounder stocks.I don't want to miss that anymore.",2024-09-26
This is where the world must step in. Introduce a DRUG AFFORDIBILITY ACT. Maybe this is where India and China step in. Makes product affordable in India and also increases medical and pharma tourism.Allow companies to manufacture drugs on patent as follows.Pay 50% of sales price to the company holding the patent for the first year of patent coverage after first drug introduced to market.45% for year 240% for year 335% for year 430% for year 5 25% for year 6 to 820% for year 9 to 1510% until the expiry of patent,2024-09-24
@Tim Cunningham WBA is a great long term buy imo it is different then rite aid. Still growing the top line and they have many assets at their disposal. Further them closing stores underperforming ones will help with profitability. Long WBA I expect this time next year WBA stock price will be much higher,2024-09-22
$WBA here is a speculative buy based on CEO willing to make bold moves. I see the terms changing too.,2024-09-22
