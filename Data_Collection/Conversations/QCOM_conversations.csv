"Interesting how Mastercard can keep the M&A going while visa gets sued for being too large and anti competitive when theres essentially no difference between V and MA.Which is why I hold both lol.This is the kinda news coverage I come here for SA.Facts and numbers regarding my companies.Sadly ""something something politics"" is what gets all the comments and engagement so this news will be quickly buried in favor of ragebait.Many such cases.

@Leodavinci Recent sanctions against China on x86 cost Intel bilions in lost revenues and disrupted Intel's time schedules for investing in new fab constructions.   Intel was forced to do deals with partners on fab construction that will cost Intel some revenues over the long term. Intel figure that they can no longer rely entirel on x86 manufactuing alone and have to bring in ARM manufacturing through IFS or merger with Qualcomm   in bid to dominate the ARM markets outside Apple.Intel may still be skeptical about Qualcomm's ARM  Snapdragon chips until Qualcomm start gaining on the x86 laptop market  enough to convince Intel to start letting ARM in . Intel will drop IFS services to other ARM clone makers if Intel decide to merge with Qualcomm so they can concentrate on own ARm chip for themselves.I dont think this will require anti trust investigations..  Anybody else can build own fabs to make ARM chips for any clone ARMs..  Apple can learn to build own fabs themselves.. EVen NVDIA!   They are not crybabies.,2024-10-02

I have been buying MU.... This is the cheapest stock...,2024-10-01
I dont think QCOM can buy Intel whole but the former can merge with Intel on all stock basis and ration swap to be determined.  I think we will see one Qcom for 3 Intc share swap.  I bet that Intel already made Snapdragon with 18A and Qcom is testing them rightnow and like them very much . Qcom will use IFS to make Snapdragons . AMD can build own new fabs if they need to. They sold fabs 15 years but this doesnt mean that AMD cannot build own fabs again and call them own.,2024-10-01
"@chrisgar Thanks for clarifying the AI revenue to that of the vmware acquisition. Today's dip has more to do with ""Iran fires missile"" hurting Nasdaq.Iran also 'attacked' Iraq with plenty of notice in April 2024.",2024-10-01
@Chris Lau  AVGO is guiding to $12B for semiconductor AI revenue in 2024.   (that part isn't VMWare),2024-10-01
$AVGO's cc hyping AI when revenue was all from ancient...VMWare...did not rub me the right way.It's on the AI Bubble ðŸ«§Watch.,2024-10-01

Intel reminds me of IBM decades ago when they were the largest and most profitable tech/ mainframe company in the market and completely missed the transition to the PC market . In addition they ultimately botched the PC / Lenovo deal. Too profitable and too big to fail is not possible and Intel reminds us of this valuable lesson. General Electric/ Jeff Immelt reminds me of this lesson as well. It is amazing what happens when you have the right leadership and culture starting from the top. Lastly Boeing is another example of one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world failing due to change in leadership and culture at the top. It started at Boeing when one of 3 Sr execs at G.E. reporting up to Welch lost out to Immelt in the race for the top position at G.E. and then was hired as CEO at Boeing. If I recall this may have been the beginning of Boeing outsourcing the manufacturing of all their millions of parts that go into a Boeing airplane.  Many many much smarter finance execs than I on these Alpha articles.  What was primary cause of these companies down falls? Wrong pick for CEO and then they packed board w their cronies or was it more complex than that. Interested in your thoughts. Respectfully. Mike,2024-09-26

"Their current assets were about $50B and cash and equivalents a little over $30B at the end of last quarter.  $5B is more than a drop in the bucket, especially if it comes in as partnership equity for a new asset - no additional interest or depreciation burden on existing capacity, no additional burden on current assets as this period of catch up investment ends and balanced investment/profitability takes over.",2024-09-26

Love all this BS about AI-   Anyone watch you tube videos at all?   Ever see text written by AI be correct?  AI is not off to a great start. .    People have a lot of faith in something that canâ€™t even seem to manage to get simple words correct when coming up with text from a clearly spoken video . I think they tell be a lot of pull back soon before theyâ€™re wil be a big gain.  A week or two ago I was predicting a huge gain for AMD but IDK I think the investor is tired and weary if AI and AMD right now.  I was calling it at $174 for a few weeks but then I saw a weakening and expected a drop back to $144 -$148. Either the investor gets sick of holding money in the sideline or the investor gets tired of waiting for AMD. To perform and put on a show.,2024-09-26
