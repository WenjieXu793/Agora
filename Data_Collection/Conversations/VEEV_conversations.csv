"@Benjamin Graham Cracker that's right!, Peter Gassner was a former employee in Salesforce, but I think he discovered a space where Salesforce was weak: the life science industry. Gassner ended up setting up Veeva Systems, and I think knowing how Salesforce operaates, he worked so hard to innovate so fast to have a big advantage in the life science industry. Now, CRM has a partnership with IQVIA, but Veeva innovates way faster than IQVIA, at least, that's what I've seen in the last decade. Maybe the market right now is not fully understanding what is the Veeva's vision for the long term which is to have a full ecosystem of integrated softwares covering different critical areas under the same CRM platform. I do not see neither Salesforce nor IQVIA in this path. Veeva was using paart of the Salesforce CRM platform until recently, right now, Veeva is in a process of migration to its own CRM (Veeva Vault CRM). So Veeva pays a fee to Salesforce for the usage of its CRM plartform, and that was a way in which Salesforce was exposed to the life science industry. But that contract will end soon, so Salesforce is reacting to keep beeing exposed to the life science industry through a partnership with IQVIA. Of course Salesforce is well diversified through different sectors, and Veeva needs to protect its moat in the life science industry, so that's why Veeva is advancing and innovating faster. If salesforce fails in the life science industry, nothing happens, as it is well diversified, but if Veeva fails, its entire business model can be disrupted, so that's why Veeva does not have any debt, it's very conservative in its capital allocation, and innovates faster than competitors as a way to protect its business model from disruption.  Veeva's TAM is $20 billion so, there is lots of room to keep growing in the long term for Veeva.",2024-10-01
"@Is2 Dive4 I mean, Veeva was originally built on top of Salesforce, until recently. So, why couldn't Salesforce do the same thing?",2024-09-30
"@rygo  - Spot on assessment. The true value add here with VEEV is the combined App suite of Vault  and CRM together.  That is a deep penetrating moat and adds substantive value and silos, ...proprietary to VEEV. Salesforce does not have a comp solution set. Ai is the buzz phrase and shiny new objects abound everywhere. To your point: Standards, Compliance and the whole deep network for creation, capture, integration and processing as well as communication within this vertical is decades of dedicated proprietary work, specific to this sector. It is now a foundational critical infrastructure component and virtually ubiquitous.",2024-09-30
"Analyst misunderstanding of what VEEV does and what CRM offers today. Two different offerings, maybe CRM will have something in the future that will eat VEEV's lunch; however they may be preparing something of their own.",2024-09-30
"@rygo agree, maybe those analysts want to listen about any trash product but named with ""AI"".....right now, the life science industry has different sort of softwares from different vendors and very disconnected among them. The future is to offer an entire ecosystem of software products that cover different areas while storing data.....data that can be used in AI models. I think that Veeva is the only one who has this long term vision...to offer the data that can be ran in AI models in the future. Right now, it's not possible to build a viable and truly value added software with AI...since things in the Life Science industry works in a different way.",2024-09-30
"I'm sure AI has a future in life sciences tech, but I will not get to excited about any company's AI narrative in this space until they can demonstrate CFR Part 11 compliance & have clients that have successfully gotten through an FDA submission that includes data/processes that utilized the tech.  There are plenty of things to do on the research side with AI, but VEEV has primarily specialized in the creation/capture/transmission of regulated data, which is inherently slower to evolve and has a huge trust hurdle to overcome (and in this case it's a slow-moving govt agency that will need to get comfortable to accept the usage of this new tech).  I'm thinking of clinical operations, trial data, safety, quality, and regulatory related products.Maybe there is more of a threat in the commercial (CRM, etc.) side of the business, but the other stuff is the core value chain.To be fair, I haven't looked into what was presented at Dreamforce this month, just speaking from work history in life sciences tech.  Like any AI tech narrative, AI tech in the LifeSci space deserves a ""show me where you did this already"" approach.",2024-09-30
Anyone knows why VEEV's good stock price performance of late seems to have stalled? Does it have something to do with CRM's Dreamforce event last week?,2024-09-24
"@Chris Lau APP, PEGA, and GPN, in that order, seem really interesting.  TY!",2024-09-13
@RealRural QQQJ maybe?  Index fund though and newer so performance isn't that impressive yet.,2024-09-10
"@Pingili I'm not saying but today. in fact, I'm adding to bonds at this moment. but I have 4 off this list and will add as I deem appropriate. ddog I got for $80 and will add more shares at some point.",2024-09-10
"Good ideas and theory on this press release, but way too much research for this ancient investor. Anyone have recommendations if there is/are mid-cap tech ETFs or CEFs to look at? I'd be happy to get decent performance with diversified tech risk from a mid cap fund.",2024-09-10
"I actually see quite a few solid companies here with share prices that should appreciate considerably, if not immediately. Some names I don't recognize and a few I find questionable but overall not a bad list to generate some ideas for further research.Mid-caps are something my portfolio needs desparately and I would like to open ~5 positions in a few new stocks over the coming weeks (usually 1/4th to 1/3rd the size of what I consider a full position). I'd like at least 3 to be mid-caps. I'm really eyeing TER, but my portfolio is already considerably overweight in the semiconductor industry.",2024-09-10
