"@Ted Waller When it is a surprise, one does not disclose it until the final moment before springing it.  Although I could do that, but then it would not be a surprise now would it!",2024-10-06
@Bemylov I work my tail off - just not for money.   My money works for me in that respect.Great talking to you and good luck.  I'd never tell anyone what to do with their money.,2024-10-05
"@Bemylov Not at all.  I'm just glad I bought at a fair price instread of trying to bottom feed at a double digit Yield.  I would have still been working, in my early 50's.",2024-10-05
@George Slopadopoulos Are you suggesting people should be buying regardless of the price? I hope not.,2024-10-05
"@Bemylov Lucky for me I didn't create nearly 200K of dividend income trying to time the market.  I've been 100% in the market for 30+ yearsm compressing dividend shares the whole time.  All the best, mate !!",2024-10-05
@Ted Waller I do not use the products from MO.I can collect the dividends in one end of the room and my partner in the same room doesn't know that I have a bunch of shares,2024-10-05
@User 50479619 MO’s dividends are more reliable than the Wall St. casino. When the stock price goes up and down the dividends remain steady. Design a financial plan around steady income not unstable capital. Bonds is one way to do that but if you are looking for steady income MO’s dividends outperform Bond rates. Your capital may have more stability in bonds but that is interest rate dependent too.,2024-10-05
"You can check my comments here, the high was in, and especially now with the bond vigilantes finally begining to price these long term bonds that nobody wants to hold, effectively outdoing the FED's rate cut. These are further signals to tell the FED not to cut further and may infact discourage them, once again no sense in buying or holding any of these value names like this given the longer term rates will continue to tighten as the debt continues to explode leaving things unsustainable if long term rates go lower as interest on the debt will eat up tax receipts. Longer term rates could see 5-6% in a year or two and Altria will only be paying 7 or 8% max? Not worth the nominal fluctuation risk of owning a stock for 2% more per year than a bond, unless you believe the govt will default (but youd want to be in gold also). This means the value trade swap that occured in start of 2024 and finished in July-August will unravel even further thanks to the bond players finally pricing long term bonds accordingly.",2024-10-05
@George Slopadopoulos l have no doubt that MO and BTI will come down in share price before the end of the year. Both have been treading downward in the past 1-2 weeks.,2024-10-05
@Bemylov Nicotine is actually a growth industry.  The new delivery methonds have made it a growth story again.,2024-10-04
@KM Capital l’m not buying above $38-39. It is a dying industry.,2024-10-04
@StevieCool And that will likely happens if she wins. I want every MO stock owned to bear that in mind. Vote to protect your interest not based on personality.,2024-10-04
"Can they not rename it ""NJOY by Marlboro"" or something like that?  They must not be able to use Marlboro in assocation with NJOY.",2024-10-04
Last 3qtrs avg EPS growth - 0.8%. Last qtr % Earnings surprise -2.6% that's negative earnings. Keeps going like this I wouldn't say the dividend is secure.,2024-10-04
"I’ve owned the shares for a long time. The dividend is robust and solid, but to label it a strong buy anywhere above $51 is pushing it. I hope I’m wrong",2024-10-04
"@KM Capital I have all the time I need to wait for that time, besides, my current MO holdings are well ahead, so it's actually getting paid to wait.  haha",2024-10-04
"@Bemylov as the saying goes, ""the more it drops, the more I buy.""",2024-10-04
@Bemylov A lot of things come together. Dividend discount and fear that Kamala could win the election. Then she'll probably declare war on cigarettes....,2024-10-04
"@Tyler Durden 42   I've heard that argument. One, the analysis conflates legal and illegal immigrants as if they were of the same economic cohort. Two, somehow immigrants add to government coffers, but citizens have only managed drain the U.S. Treasury with $37 trillion in debt. Makes no sense.",2024-10-03
MO has been dropping for two weeks of trading session. What gives?,2024-10-03
