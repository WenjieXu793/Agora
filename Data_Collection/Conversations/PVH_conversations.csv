"@zander88 I have analyzed all of the companies you mentioned. In my opinion, ANF and GAP are more retailing. No runways, less style-defined, more trend followers. Great business, not saying the contrary, only that it's a different business model. RL is more similar to PVH. They are indeed growing comparables, versus PVH down, mostly via AUR. However, when I look at RL's campaigns, I don't see that much of a difference with PVH. They also use influencers heavily, and are not launching super innovative lines. What do you think differentiates RL from PVH? I genuinely ask with the goal of learning your opinion, not of attacking you or anything.",2024-09-10
"The brands are loosing value based on generic and ineffective marketing. CK and TH have predictable and obvious products as well as overpriced and inappropriate influencers and star promoting their campaigns and designs. RL, A&F, Leviâ€™s and even GAP are outperforming these directless me too brands. Not to understand, compare and contrast PVH brands and products to key competitors is irresponsible as a stock analyst. PVH has earned its relatively low valuation and will continue to fall.",2024-09-10
