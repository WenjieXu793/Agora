"@Blackgold2006 I think there's a lot of us DVN holders hoping anyone takes us out. It gets no respect, even after last earn report, which was spectacular costs coming down profits going up. With the new pipeline in service now they should be making some money on natural gas instead of losing money.",2024-10-08 10:57:44.605848
"@Philip3 Sounds bearish all right.  Zacks Earning ESP is -3.61%, not good.  And WOW, SA shows 15 downward estimate revisions as we move toward earnings in early November.I guess the author thinks its an undervalued stock.  Or maybe an income play.  I'd rather buy $ET and get return of capital.",2024-10-08 10:57:44.605848
"@Thomas44 Would love to see COP, EOG or CVX take DVN out.",2024-10-08 10:57:44.605848
"@Sti Selini From my brokerage:  (Bear opinion) ""After incorporating sunk costs from leaseholds, acquisitions, exploration, and infrastructure, Devon's capital base inflates to a level that could threaten excess returns.Devon’s profitability in the Permian can’t be matched in other parts of its portfolio.Production growth could periodically outpace midstream capacity additions in the Permian Basin, creating bottlenecks like Devon faced in the first half of 2023."" Downgrade: ""2 stars out of 5."" Price target $36. (CFRA)",2024-10-08 10:57:44.605848
"@Sti Selini  I got in at $55.41 after reading 16 straight buy articles and am still down 22% today.  Stone Fox suggested I keep on buying more :)  I have never blocked or removed an analyst, but SFC may well be the first. I suspect that when the war premium is over, DVN's drop will be outsized. Fingers crossed the short rally continues.",2024-10-08 10:57:44.605848
"DVN: worst purchase of the year. After reading 16 straight buy articles, I jumped in. Still down 22%. Hopefully the run will continue. When the the war premium comes to a close, this will be back to $38.",2024-10-08 10:57:44.605848
"@Stone Fox Capital I guess you haven't been in the markets very long.  Falling knife stocks are quite common. For those of us those who have been stung, we are very hesitant to average down to the bottom as you suggest we should. Very questionable advice.",2024-10-08 10:57:44.605848
@Sti Selini $DVN is the type of stock where you don't worry about the falling knife theory. Those buying the dip look really good now.,2024-10-08 10:57:44.605848
"Nice rally for $DVN, but the stock isn't anywhere close to all-time highs like $XOM. -Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) shares continued gains for seven straight sessions, as the stock closed 0.5% higher at $42.6 on Monday.-The company gained about 8% in the preceding six sessions. Overall, the stock has lost nearly 6% so far this year, compared to the over 20% rise in the broader S&P 500 Index.",2024-10-08 10:57:44.605848
@Steve Mmm Schwab paid half a day late. Sounds like many have received the total div of .44 in two .22 payments. Some received both on Monday. Some half on Monday and half on Tuesday.,2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"Despite the false narrative of trump and the republicans, as I have been writing on Seeking Alpha for a few years now: we live in a ""New Age of Energy Abundance"" and the U.S. is energy independent (by an estimated ~3 million boe/d) and is the #1 petroleum producer on the planet and the #1 LNG exporter on the planet. This is one reason the XLE Energy ETF is one of the worst performing sector ETFs over the past decade (if not the worst ...) and if it wasn't for Putin & Netanyahu's wars, the results would have been even worst, and likely significantly so. Meantime, note the American ""big-3"" (Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips) aren't making any significant investments in wind, solar, and battery backup capacity. As a result, they are increasingly ill-prepared for the 21st Century of electrification and they are increasingly contributing to global warming, and we saw the results of that with the horrific recent hurricane that laid waste to so much of the Southeastern U.S. and took more than 100 lives.There is no way the planet will stop burning up as long as the ""Big-3"" (little 3?) refused to invest some of their cash-flow directly into renewables. Further, the supposed ""carbon sequestration"" is a total disaster, ineffective, and waste of time, money, and resources. What a world!",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
@RockNBlues I got half the div on Sept 30 and the other half on Oct 1,2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"The dividend I received yesterday (9/30/24) was 22 cents per share, whereas I had expected 44 cents.  I find support for both dividends in what I have read.  Can anyone advise as to what it was supposed to be the dividend?",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@Jeremyf4 I have absolutely no idea what you're saying when you state ""I'm giving you an example""...what does that even mean and what was the example you gave?  Same thing for not understanding your comment/position ""Oil is not a good long-term investment"", especially since you're touting DVN as a long term buy & hold.  Secondly, you are saying E&P companies are good investments but oil is not a good long-term investment.  How do you square those opposite positions?  Also ironic that when I showed you DVN and the times it's been under $30, which supports my call, you complain that I chose too short a time frame...when I then showed you how poorly its' done over nearly 20 years, you then say it's also not a good investment long term as if that was your position before reading my prior post?  Which one is it?  FYI, I'm the one who pointed out to you that DVN hasn't been a good long term buy & hold, so it's ironic that you're trying to claim that as your position and conclusion.  It's really pretty simple...as the price of oil falls, so too will the earnings of the E&P companies you're referencing and ergo, their share prices will also decline.   Your post that I'm replying to, it's a case of serious backpedaling and changing your positions and your stance.  It's filled with so many contradictions, it's hard to keep track.  Lastly, you're utterly clueless about energy investing and it shows in one simple sentence you typed above.  While touting DVN, you said ""investing in big integrated and solid domestic producers is a fantastic opportunity"".  DVN is not an integrated producer.  They are upstream only.  Ditto for the others you mentioned, FANG & PXD.  None of these companies owns midstream assets nor downstream assets.  They don't pipe oil to refiners on their own pipelines, they don't refine the product, they aren't diversified into chemicals, and they don't own gas pumps where they sell their own refined gasoline.  XOM & CVX are integrated oil companies-DVN, FANG & PXD are not, they are E&P companies.   As far as where I'm investing, I've mentioned it multiple times on this website over the past few months.  You can easily look it up at your leisure and match up the date(s) of my posts to how the market has done since then.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
"@RockNBlues I moved from Schwab for a couple of reasons as their “back office” left sometime to be desired.  My main complaint was that they did not show the dividend in one’s account till sometimes late in the day, or even the next day.I moved my custodian service to Fidelity.  For this DVN dividend, it only showed half the dividend, but that half was credited twice to arrive at the full dividend.  First time that has ever happened, but received the full dividend.  You might check and see if you got two “half’s”.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
"@OilBull123 I’m giving you an example. Oil is not a good long-term investment. You need to pick your spots. You can go ahead and quote all of your research over time on oil investing. Right now, investing in big integrated and solid domestic producers is a fantastic opportunity. The market is at its higher range in price to earnings. Oil companies have dramatically, shifted their strategy in recent years to focus more on profitability. If you have read or understand anything about the new world of energy investing, companies are now pumping out pure profits as opposed to historical investing where increasing volumes was the goal. Look at the profits of a DVN, FANG, PXD (previously) of these companies and they are outstanding considering their valuations. Again, where are you investing right now? Please answer my question.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
"@Jeremyf4 I'm not cherry picking anything.  I said it's going below $30 and your reply, an exact quote, was ""History is not on your side so you have no basis.""  I then gave you multiple time frames in the not too distant past as to when it went below $30.  When that blew up your argument, you then start complaining that my timeframe wasn't long enough and that it was cherry picked.   As far as longer term timeframes, try this on for size...in 2008, Devon was a $120 stock-today it closed below $40, which is approx. 67% below where it was 16 YEARS AGO!  Not long enough for you?  Okay, try this on for size...in April 2005, Devon was a $50 stock-today it closed below $40, which is 20% below where it was 19 YEARS AGO!  Are those two time frames-16 years worth of history and a second time frame encompassing 19 years-a long enough time frame for you???  Plain & simple, history is on my side and you have no clue what you are talking about.  5 minutes of simple research would have shown this to you.  Unfortunately, I get the feeling that you still wouldn't interpret the data correctly even if you had looked.  The bottom line is that anybody who has bought and held DVN over the past 15-20 years has been absolutely decimated on the DVN investment by itself; and that has been further exacerbated by opportunity cost of not being invested in one of the greatest market periods in history.  You may want to get your head out of the sand before you blow your investment portfolio up.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000

"@Jeremyf4;  Do you mean ""oil energy"" starved?  Who is burning more coal? I can't think of any other than the electrical energy producers.  Solar and wind must not be providing what they expected and the generators must be at their oil and NG limits, so they turned their coal plants back on.  Wait 'till winter.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
