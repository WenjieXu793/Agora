"Thanks for the Article. I'm concerned about the growing trend of car manufacturers integrating advanced IoT devices into their vehicles. These devices collect extensive user data, enabling manufacturers to potentially bypass traditional telematics service providers (TSPs) like ITRN and sell the data directly to third-party companies like LexisNexis and Verisk Analytics or insurance companies. This could reduce the incentive for insurance companies to offer preferential treatment to end-users who utilize TSP services. What are your thoughts on the implications of this trend for ITRN?",2024-09-25
