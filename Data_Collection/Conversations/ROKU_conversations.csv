The upside of increased ad fill rates from DSPs on the Roku Channel and other FAST channels is IMO underestimated significantly.  It won’t all come on board at once but personally I think 20-25% or more revenue growth in 2025 is on the table.,2024-10-05
Thanks. I don't know what to do about ROKU but I'm not going long when the company doesn't make money and a recession is very possible.,2024-09-30
Wish $AMZN would tender an offer like $wmt did with $vzio,2024-09-26
Profound insights by Citigroup…. Dave Levine Research is upgrading Roku to a buy with a $100 target based on increased political ad spending…,2024-09-25
"“Citi raised PT on ROKU to $77 from $60, implying an upside of 28%”It does not imply that. The stock was already at $75 when this came out. They are merely raising their price target to catch up with the stock, as these types of analysts often have to do.",2024-09-25
@Stone Fox Capital this should be a great stock for rest of this year and next.  Streaming is future and cutting cable bills,2024-09-19
"Ads Manager sounds very promising. -To expand the reach of online shopping platforms like Shopify (SHOP), Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) has launched Ads Manager, a direct, self-service platform where marketers can buy interactive, ConnectedTV, or CTV, video ads for their brands and provide customers a seamless checkout experience right on their TV.-With Ads Manager, marketers can generate interactive video overlays that enable customers to send themselves a text message while watching a video ad, place messages alongside ad-sponsored content, and even use Roku’s (ROKU) artificial intelligence tool to create ads.",2024-09-18
Another good news for ROKU. ROKU INC - AMC+ WITH ADS LAUNCHES AS A PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION ON THE ROKU CHANNEL.,2024-09-18
"Waiting for a rebound to sell so I can get back to even. I like the Roku TV interface, have been using it for years and even recommend it to others, but...1. Spyware. New terms and conditions prevent use of the TV that I own unless I agree to spyware. 2. Advertising oversaturation. Every extra 10% that Roku makes per user means that I have to watch at least 10% more ads, and my eyeballs just can't take it. There are other opportunities out there, so I'll wait for the next pop and get out for good. Not because I don't use the product, but because I don't think they're innovating anymore. Sometimes companies just sit back and become toll trolls, and it seems like Roku might be going that route.",2024-09-17
"@FMA1995 Now you are getting somewhere. I would still sharpen your definition of Costco's moat further. If you pick up any analyst research anywhere and search for Costco's moat you will see that its moat is the result of ""efficient operations"" on one side and ""scale of members"" on the other side. Because of the massive scale of its paid member program, Costco has the ability to negotiate product pricing almost down to production cost and create robust differential value for its members that's hard to find at any other retailer. That is Costco's moat and that is achieved because of the superior balance of its member network (a.k.a demand distribution) and its suppliers (a.k.a supply distribution) that is perfected over time. And suppliers see access to Costco's loyal members as a huge advantage hence fight to get onto Costco's shelves.I used the Costco example to explain Roku. To be clear. Roku does not have a moat yet. Moats take time to build and Roku has successfully built just one side of the problem - its ~90 million active households. That's its supply distribution. It has started doubling down on building its ad business (which is its demand).",2024-09-17
"@Uttam Dey Good counter, but I would argue Costco has the power to make a certain branded toilet paper popular, if they wanted to - that's moat. Suppliers are fighting for space on Costco shelves...Costco is not fighting for suppliers. Costco/Walmart can leverage that to get cheaper per unit costs. You're correct I don't fully understand the intricacies of DSPs/SSPs, etc.. Right or wrong, keeping it simple, Roku has a platform that is dependent on ads for profit. There are many platforms dependent on ads for profit, especially in the space that Roku is in (which I would put as distributor/media/home ent?). I have to believe that Roku is necessary/relevant for the space it operates in for it to have any leverage and I have to believe Roku has the strength to outcompete its very relevant competitors long term as there is finite ad spend companies have every year...I see Roku's leverage decreasing long term as I don't see their platform as necessary or important and its ripe to be upended.",2024-09-16
"@FMA1995 Your argument is like this: You want to buy from $COST because its cheap and has large stores stocked with inventory. But then you suddenly think : ""I can just buy all the toilet paper and kitchen paper towels directly from Costco's supplier? Why should I buy from Costco when the supplier might give me a better deal?"" And that's the same reason you might tell me not to invest in $COST because it doesn't have a moat...... anyone can go to COST's supplier.I dont think you understand the partnership between $TTD and other DSPs with $ROKU or how the entire digital ad network is laid out or who is a DSP or who is an SSP? what are their roles? How Google and Facebook's Ad exchange works? How Roku benefits from this? I dont think you understand any of this. Id be happy to answer more questions if you have any.",2024-09-16
Article mentioned Roku benefits because of Trade Desk Partnership...implies value is coming Trade Desk. So why even go with Roku when Trade Desk can extends partnership to other companies beyond Roku? Can just drop Roku long term once they've extracted the short term benefitsRoku doesn't have a strong moat. It's moat in cheap tvs is because its cheap not necessarily desirable. Roku is ripe to be upended long term.,2024-09-16
@I Am The Storm I do not expect them to be GAAP Positive this year but based on its adj. EBITDA trajectory and the growth in its platform revenue it could achieve GAAP profits by Q2-Q3 next year. Roku's business was always meant to be geared fully towards an ad platform. I dont know why they took so long to build capabilities for advertisers because they have one of the best distribution network in one of the fastest growing end user markets - CTVs. The ad business is also a high margin business where Roku gets to keep 55-60% of its sales as Gross Profits versus the device business which is in the single-mid digits.,2024-09-16
"Roku’s Q2 2024 shareholder letter referenced a third-party report from ""SMI"", stating that year-over-year growth in Roku’s advertising for Q2 ""outperformed both the overall ad market and the OTT ad market in the US"".Roku has been the #1 TV streaming OS and app store in the US for years. Historically, while it saw ad monetization as strategically important, it didn't seem to prioritize it at the top of its list of urgencies. However, with Roku’s renewed focus on revenue growth — demonstrated by recent third-party DSP deals — and its ongoing transition toward GAAP profitability — highlighted by Roku’s CFO at the Annual Needham Conference in May 2024 — it seems ""ready"" to deliver what investors have been looking for.Roku has become EBITDA positive over the past two quarters, after seven consecutive quarters of negative EBITDA. Additionally, its GAAP losses have steadily decreased, with a $34 million loss in April–June 2024 — a significant improvement from the $330 million loss just three quarters ago.Things are looking promising.",2024-09-16
"@eemoon that’s because Roku is being artificially held down. This company has a unique position in the market, no arguing that. Their intentional strategy has been to invest and push out profitability to a future date and profitability is inevitable.",2024-09-14
People are cutting cable for streaming.Roku and amazon let you watch both live tv and streaming channels.The value for Roku is they are replacing captive cable with their own captive platform where you can pay and select what you want to watch including many free live streaming channelsOnly live sports is holding the cable companies afloatEarly innings - Roku will monetize and replace Comcast NBC CBS etc,2024-09-13
"All of this political ad spending should help.  I think we should start heading back to $100.  In the long run, there is no reason why it couldn’t go back to the 2-300 dollar range like it was before.",2024-09-12
"Cleveland Research with rather bullish research. -Cleveland Research said on Wednesday that third quarter results for Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) would likely be ahead of consensus, helped by linear gains, TTD tailwinds, CPM investments and execution.-""3Q momentum sounds strong, driven by incremental linear TV gains, tailwinds from programmatic efforts, and solid ROKU execution on new products/initiatives—ROKU leveraging supply growth to win on price,"" the research firm said in their September 11 commentary.-Cleveland said the outlook for the streaming device company ""looks more constructive,"" judging by its ability to compete due to new products, new advertisers gains, lower CPMs, and better agency relationships. They expect most growth to come via DSPs.-On TTD, Cleveland said partnership seems to be driving incremental revenue as programmatic access improves and volume growth exceeds CPM declines. On ACR data benefits, they said advertisers see runway for further expansion/tailwinds into 2025.",2024-09-12
"@RMBA ""up another 7%, in addition to that 5% bump""Well it is up a little more, but a total of 5.17% since the article was posted. Still impressive, tho'.Just tryin' to keep it honest now - I'm long ROKU and liking the bump.",2024-09-11
