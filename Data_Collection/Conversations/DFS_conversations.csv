"@ocbearclaw It would make no difference what rate they charge as they would still have the issue of people being unable to pay it off.  Banks and any lending institution need to make money as well and there are too many people out here that ""just need to have the big screen TV,"" because it is more important than maybe buying food and then when the bill comes, they make the minimum payment, oh and they all need cellphones.  I have not paid interest on a charge card for 40 plus years.  Maybe a little restraint in usage would help, remember you can go and borrow money from a bank and pay the 8-10%.. You see there are alternatives",2024-10-05
"I think the banks should charge whatever interest rates they want, BUT when the interest rates are like 20% a year, it’s a black hole that nobody can pay back.. I’ve seen family and friends just give up and BK because the black hole is too big. Maybe they should at least ponder lowering the rates so the consumer could actually have a chance to repay their debt, it might help them in the long run",2024-10-05
It would have been better if it is explained how it is going to benefit the consumers and the bank.,2024-10-04
I would prefer that DFS not merge with Capital One. I see more benefit for the latter and worry that their strong historical ROIC will be diluted.,2024-09-27
@Chancer DFS and COF are most certainly not considered weak banks.,2024-09-27

"@CatchingFIRE A. The U.S. budgeting process is terribly broken. My consistent suggestion to address this issue is to end baseline budgeting. For example, all the money budgeted to address COVID remained in the baseline after COVID was no longer an issue. Why?We need to get to a zero-based budgeting approach, which may have been the only positive thing ever attempted by President Carter.B. You say, ""....my understanding is that trickle-down economics has been pretty thoroughly discredited."" No, it hasn't been. It fact, pretty much the opposite is true. (BTW,  I don't refer to it as ""trickle down,"" which is a pejorative characterization, but rather as ""flow through."") Federal revenues DOUBLED during the Reagan presidency, despite lower tax rates. The problem was lack of spending discipline. That lack of discipline was only reined in during the late 1990's, as a result of the passage of the Balanced Budget Act. The result, as you probably know, was a budget surplus for a year or two. Alas, both parties allowed the act to lapse in the early 2000's, primarily in response to 9/11.",2024-09-27
"@Tyler Durden 42 Marquette ruling details the legal mechanics of Marquette are about as dry as it gets. The case involved two banks: Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis, where the state's usury law capped interest rates for loans at 12 percent; and the First National Bank of Omaha in Nebraska, where the state laws allowed an interest rate of up to 18 percent. To make up for the low cap in Minnesota, banks in Minnesota could charge an annual fee, which they did. But then, First National Bank of Omaha started marketing its no-annual-fee credit cards to Minnesota residents.Seeing itself at a disadvantage, Marquette sued, charging that the Omaha bank was violating Minnesota's usury law. The Supreme Court ruled, essentially, that state usury laws don't apply to nationally chartered banks based in other states. Plus, nationally chartered banks can ""export"" the interest rates allowed in their own states to customers throughout the country.The ruling made a sweeping interpretation of the National Bank Act, a law passed by Congress in 1864 as the United States was three years into the Civil War and in desperate need of financing for the Union's war effort. Until then, banks were only chartered by states. The National Bank Act created a way for the federal government to charter its own banks, which could issue bank notes backed by government bonds.The Smiley case sets stage for high fees The Marquette ruling also set the stage for another landmark Supreme Court decision regarding the credit card industry, Smiley vs. Citibank. In that case, a California woman, Barbara Smiley, had filed a class action lawsuit against Citibank's South Dakota-based credit card division, claiming that the $15 late fee she was charged on her credit card bill violated California state law. Citibank responded that the late fee was, in effect, interest and was covered under the National Bank Act. The Supreme Court agreed; the result was an increase of late fees and other fees from $10 or $15 to the $39 fee that credit card customers may see today.Michael Donovan, one of the attorneys who argued the Smiley case before the Supreme Court, says that the pair of decisions ""probably caused terrific abuses in the credit card market. Because they both created such ambiguity as to what law would regulate credit card lending, it was unclear for many, many years who had primary regulatory authority over credit offered in interstate transactions. ... It probably stunted the growth of an honest credit card market for over 20 years."" The result, he says, were the kinds of ""tricks and traps based on legal gimmickry"" that led to the Credit CARD Act of 2009 and the Wall Street reform law that included a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Both of those federal laws are designed to protect consumers -- but don't expect either of them to change the industry practices protected under the Marquette and Smiley decisions.Since the laws were set by the Supreme Court A President cannot overcome such usury laws by executive order and as such the laws governing. Many credit-card companies can still charge annual fees for their use, but basically is a way to circumvent any so-called usury rules.",2024-09-26
"@Tyler Durden 42 It differs because utilities are regulated monopolies, so they have price caps in return. Lenders aren't in the same situation.",2024-09-26
@nckadams you might like to look into principles of natural justice. You will find religious tones in those principles and they are also very much the foundation of laws in my view.,2024-09-26
"@jonesdl261 ""You see credit card users should be responsible.""As should lenders.  In fact, the homeowners/borrowers in 2007/08 who helped bring the world economy to it's knees lost almost everything.  The lenders in 2007/08 who helped bring the world economy to it's knees got bailed out.Sure borrower has a choice, but there are usury laws in place but for some reason credit card companies are exempt.  I argue that they shouldn't be exempt.I would also argue that high interest payments are a net negative for the economy.",2024-09-26
"@Tyler Durden 42 Well, you know one does not have to do business with them.  Free market enterprise and then there are individuals like me that that uses such credit cards and when the bill comes, I pay it off...no interest charge...You see credit card users should be responsible. Many are not and for those who are not and don't pay their bills, it is not the credit company's fault.  The holders know the rules (or should) the companies offer a service and well the consumer has a choice!!!  They make that choice, they know the rulesNo different that a car loan.  You do not make the payments; they take the car away. I have 4 credit cards; bills are paid when due I have a 2023 car that is paid for, and I have no mortgage, as house is paid for.  I don't pay the property tax; they take it away.  So, you see that's how it works and in the case of the C.C. companies they are in for a profit. follow the rules, it cost you nothing.  They warn if you do not and will charge you if you do not pay .",2024-09-26
"@StaryStaryNights I seem to recall from a distant college course in banking that the usury laws sprung from European custom that ""one should never a lender nor a borrower be.""  It was disapproved by religion to lend money and charge interest on it.  In literature, The Merchant of Venice sort of nails the issue when the court rules the lender can have his ""pound of flesh but not a single drop of blood.""Western lawmakers vaguely tried to set a ceiling on interest rates but such limits are impractical during periods of high inflation.  Mortgage rates in 1980 would have exceeded most legal limits.In my own experience in a small bank (1970's), we'd have someone come in that wanted to borrow $200 for a new TV.  Our processing cost for any loan was in the low $30's.  It would have been about the same interest charge to loan them hundreds of dollars more.  These days with the wide availability of credit cards and BNPL programs, banks must not even bother with small consumer loans anymore.""Predatory lending"" - pawnshops and payday lenders - still get reviewed for abuse but still function in poor neighborhoods.",2024-09-26
"@StaryStaryNights You asked, ""Who decides who should have credit?""The answer is obvious....the lender, of course. Who else would you think?",2024-09-26
@nckadams I think 20% sounds more appropriate for sure.  If a credit card company deems a person too high of a risk even at 20% then they shouldn't be issued a card.,2024-09-26
"@Tyler Durden 42 I'm not sure if high interest payments in themselves are ""a net overall bad thing for the economy."" What is bad about high interest rates is the dampening effect they have on consumer spending and business capital expenditures. In any case, I will agree with you that lower interest rates are better for the economy than higher interest rates.",2024-09-26
@StaryStaryNights Credit companies already decide who should have credit.  So do banks.  So they are drawing a line already.,2024-09-26
@Tyler Durden 42 I think it is difficult to draw that line. Who decides who should have credit? For some it may be a lifesaver and for others it is a trap.,2024-09-26
"I have read analysts who believe the greatest US financial risk is big banks.Discover and Capital One merger is considered a combo of 2 weak banks.In current US environment, I would not touch any big US bank.IMO, some foreign banks are safer, cheaper with higher dividends.",2024-09-26
"@StaryStaryNights That is true, but the point is that some price controls are deemed as acceptable.  While credit card companies are not a monopoly, and I am not necessarily accusing them of collusion, even consumers with good credit will find it tough to find a company that isn't charging double digit rates.",2024-09-26
