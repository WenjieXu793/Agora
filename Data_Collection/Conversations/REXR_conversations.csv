"Thanks for the article. Do you think 6.5% core FFO yoy growth a new normal growth for $REXR? Its growths were much greater in previous years, so this year is definitely an inflection point that goes downward.",2024-10-08 11:48:28.458372

"@Arimnestos As far as REXR being a complementary holding to PLD, I completely agree. I don't own either right now but that arrangement is my intent.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"""Since rate cuts could be complete by the end of 2026, REXR can likely refinance its debt at rates similar to its weighted average of 3.8%.""I'm not sure when they did their last debt deal, but at current levels, I imagine their looking at something close to 5%. And, I wouldn't count on much improvement as the fed does not control LT rates. The 10 year rose after the recent 50 BP cut.Nevertheless, I agree mostly with the authors conclusions, but would suggest REXR is a completmentary reit. If one already has broad geographic exposure through PLD or FR or even STAG, then REXR makes a lot of sense. I'm long PLD and EGP, but could see adding REXR, at the right price.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000

"Hi Kody, I own REXR, and I've been waiting for a recovery, which really hasn't happened imo.  Still, I'll continue to hold.  I'm thinking 2025, 2026 should be good for REXR's price recovery.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
@dondougie good comment...rexr.prb/pff pair is near where it was at beginning of the year (it underperformed up until 7/18)..it has had a four sigma move since then so profit taking is warranted...having said that on a longer term (3yr) horizon its trading about .5 sigma rich so further upside would not be surprising..I am long,2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000

"@CC-TX I hear you. Naturally, it all depends on the entry price. Moreover, the industrial sector has been facing headwinds and while REXR is relatively well-prepared for them, Mr Market discounted it as well.So part of it was also sector-wise. Regardless, at a valuation, I consider REXR a strong pick. Upcoming positive market shifts should facilitate its rebound and we will likely see that reflected in the stock price moving forward.As always, time will tell. Thank you for stopping by and sharing your perspective!",2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
"I've owned REXR for one year.  It has just managed to tread water on total return while my other REITS have climbed steadily.  I keep wondering if this is such a great investment, why doesn't the stock price reflect it?",2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
