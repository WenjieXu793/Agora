"@Non-GAAP Earnings if you care about the stock market in general and WY in particular, Harris is the one. I wouldn't be surprised if the S&P hits 10K by the end of her term.If you care about the United States, and anything else that matters, Trump is the one, but it will crush the stock market.",2024-10-01
"I have held WY since 2016. While it’s true that in all that time it is only up 60%, exclusive of dividends, i continue to hold because they own 11 million acres of forestland - one of the largest private owners in the world. I consider timberland to be a precious resource, and want to maintain a position in it. I also own farmland. It’s part of my overall diversification strategy - so i will continue to hold. But, having said that,  I do agree with much of your analysis!",2024-09-18

"There's about to be one of the biggest housing construction booms in decades as government tries to magically create ""affordable housing"" by taking on massive public debt, without reducing regulations and without lowering their piece of the action.  Should be interesting to watch.",2024-09-18
"@billrla I don't know about that. I see it as more of a government handout that could be better spent. Getting paid just to own land and control harvest is a money grab. Even Ikea's land division has been buying up forest in the south to take advantage. And then there's the wood pellet industry that clear cuts vast acreage, pelletizes and ships overseas for burning to create electricity. They consider the entire process carbon neutral and other countries even subsidize the power plants to falsely claim they are meeting co2 reduction goals when in actuality the pellets release far more co2 than the coal they replaced. The theory being that in 30-40 years, newly planted trees will reabsorb todays co2 output. A lot of assumption there. But trees and their owners are looking to exploit the ""renewable"" aspect and profit from it.As to Brazil and the Amazon, often called the lungs of the planet, it would not be the worst idea to pay that country to stop the clearcutting if it was something they could actually accomplish. Similar to paying some African countries not to poach to preserve species and profit from tourism of a non lethal and lasting kind.But to profit every year you wait to fell trees. I don't know....",2024-09-18
@billrla And get $$$ in carbon credits for every year you delay harvesting them. That's the goal or actually I believe reality.,2024-09-17
