"Good article, but still don’t see the source for your claim of 50-80x improvement in programming a Cobot or pallet jack.  The PR link to the Nvidia partnership is impressive but I didn’t see the claim of any 50-80x improvement. Interesting that market is not valuing its robotics division.  It’s the only reason I own it.",2024-10-06
Nice article. TER is one of the best stocks to buy if the Nasdaq plunges.,2024-10-03
"@Strategic Risk Mitigation Research Pick and choose your timeframe.  Discounting the 2000 bubble there was 14 years of nothing between 2002 and 2014.  And since then inflation has ""discounted"" our dollars by 43%,so these gains are not all real.  Let's say the stock was $15/share in 2002. Now it's about $130.  In real terms that's $75, so 500% in 22 years.  7.6% per year.  Of course if you just focus on 2016 to the present, performance has been spectacular.  So how do you know investers aren't ""hyping it up"" now?",2024-09-15
@awhealler hardly the company's fault if investors hype it up...adjusting for the dotcom bubble its up about 1000%,2024-09-14
Just look at the chart since 2000.  Be sure to correct for inflation.,2024-09-14
"@Chris Lau APP, PEGA, and GPN, in that order, seem really interesting.  TY!",2024-09-13
@RealRural QQQJ maybe?  Index fund though and newer so performance isn't that impressive yet.,2024-09-10
"@Pingili I'm not saying but today. in fact, I'm adding to bonds at this moment. but I have 4 off this list and will add as I deem appropriate. ddog I got for $80 and will add more shares at some point.",2024-09-10
"Good ideas and theory on this press release, but way too much research for this ancient investor. Anyone have recommendations if there is/are mid-cap tech ETFs or CEFs to look at? I'd be happy to get decent performance with diversified tech risk from a mid cap fund.",2024-09-10
"I actually see quite a few solid companies here with share prices that should appreciate considerably, if not immediately. Some names I don't recognize and a few I find questionable but overall not a bad list to generate some ideas for further research.Mid-caps are something my portfolio needs desparately and I would like to open ~5 positions in a few new stocks over the coming weeks (usually 1/4th to 1/3rd the size of what I consider a full position). I'd like at least 3 to be mid-caps. I'm really eyeing TER, but my portfolio is already considerably overweight in the semiconductor industry.",2024-09-10
