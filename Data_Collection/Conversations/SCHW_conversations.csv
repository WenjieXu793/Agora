@Always Bullish thanks for the feedback! Yea I bought it after SVB collapse as well. It was very clearly a long at that point given different dynamics vs traditional regional banks. Company has some tailwinds on NIM as I mentioned with the balance sheet remix but I think the rate picture over the medium term is tough to ignore right now,2024-10-05
Pretty comprehensive analysis. Long Schwab since Silicon Valley Collapse when the stock collapsed. I never thought of them as a forever holding but I made a bundle since SVB collapse. Your article plus a quant rating of sell and the fact Walt Bettinger is retiring woke me to the fact that maybe it’s time to say adios.,2024-10-05
"@Williams Equity Research  Obviously I'm not the one and only judge so please stop creating stawman arguments. The facts in this article say that this Texas exchange have raised $135M. That's so small it's not even a rounding error for any major exchange i.e., this exchange won't even have enough liquidity for people or institutions to want to use it. So please, describe to me how such an exchange provides any substantial value?",2024-10-04
Perhaps a reason behind wanting a new exchange is the new rules and proposed rules relating to the demographics of the Board of Directors and Corporate Officers of companies listed on the NASDAQ and NYSE.Perhaps some are just crazy enough to think meritocracies produce better results than choices influenced by the chromosomes and skin pigments one is born with.,2024-10-03
"@Mbrot Agreed, it certainly seems like a fearful/defensive reaction, even by the zealots here on SA. They denigrate the decisions of Citadel, the most successful hedge fund of all time by many measures (most profits returned to investors), and claim to have a more educated opinion on a transaction they know very close to nothing about. Instead of inquiring what they might now know, they blindly criticize. The lack of humility is astounding, and yet unsurprising if you look around our country.",2024-10-03
"@Williams Equity Research - Well, maybe BLK and Citadel expect to take the new exchange to a certain point and then exit by having the NYSE or Nasdaq buy it. The initial funding is only $135 million. For a new exchange to succeed, it will need a niche where either can play. Trying to compete against the NYSE or Nasdaq on liquidity, trade execution, and cost will be tough.",2024-10-01
@Williams Equity Research Both statements can be true. rickf's point is that the texas exchange will most likely be useless. That doesn't mean BLK or citadel can't earn money but that still doesn't mean it adds any substantial value to society,2024-10-01
"@rickf so you figured this out but not the execs from Nasdaq that left to start it and not the execs at BlackRock and Citadel that funded it with their own capital? I wonder what’s more likely, you are clueless or them?",2024-10-01
"@Jeff in Oklahoma City Those are the states with the highest GDP in the country -- so I don't really see the point. California GDP: $3.9TTexas GDP: $2.6TNew York GDP: $2.2TI guess I don't see the value to the end consumer or business for trading on the TSX? How are the differentiated themselves, other than being a political statement?",2024-09-30
You're going to have to take some kind of oath to trade on this exchange which will be Starlink based in quantum Heisenberg time.,2024-09-30
@Investor_taken why will a decline in the stock market lead to budget cuts??,2024-09-30
@Jeff in Oklahoma City - It has nothing to do about where companies are domiciled. It has to do with the amount of liquidity and trade execution. Small exchanges exist in the U.S. and this will just be another one.,2024-09-30
@Euthyphro There are more Fortune 500 companies based in Texas than there are in California or New York.,2024-09-30
"@Secular_Income_Driven   Don't know about 24/7, but extending the hours of normal trading beyond 4 PM ET would definitely be an improvement and especially attractive for those who live in time zones other than Eastern.  Perhaps a 3-5 hours extension of normal trading hours makes sense.",2024-09-30
"If this exchange wants to work they need to differentiate themselves from NYSE/Nasdaq.  I would go with 24/7 trading, because if NYSE/NAS didn't match this change, and I don't think they would right away, TX could steal some market share rather quickly.",2024-09-30
Hopefully doesn't borrow too much of that Enron anything goes trading culture.  Otherwise can go trade Chinese stocks if want the wild west.,2024-09-30
"Our entire country is running off of extremely inflated assets that give the illusion of growth. When the market inevitably tanks, budget cuts will be seen like NEVER before.  Interesting times ahead for sure.",2024-09-30
"I came here to help me make the classic decision... buy...sell...hold?Option pricing tells me not to expect much for the remainder of the year.The analyst focus on cash spreads is likely correct, but not the catalyst I am searching for.  So with a major event in early Nov...I'll likely try a GTC sell a little bit higher than current market.",2024-09-26
"@Fain2018 Thank you for the feedback. I agree, those are definitely some tailwinds SCHW has embedded but I think with the rate picture moving lower (vs. SCHW's most recent guidance using the Fed dot plot from June) it's harder for me to assign a higher multiple. But I guess that's what makes a market.",2024-09-23
"Good article, agree with much except the PE multiple contracting. I think could see some expansion, particularly when the market sees the short term borrowing subside and buybacks continue. Maybe those or an inflected point where cash deposits grow instead of cash sorting",2024-09-21
