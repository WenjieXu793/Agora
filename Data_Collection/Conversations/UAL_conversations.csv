"@John Naccarelli Here’s a start:Starlink satellites are launched on Falcon 9, see list below:en.wikipedia.org/...List is broken down into years 2010-2019, 2020-2022 and 2023-2024 and future.Have fun counting!  Also remember Starlink is a subsidiary of Spacex and provides financial support for the Spacex goals:“In its 2024 forecast, Payload Research estimated that Starlink will record revenue of $6.8 billion this year, most of which will come from internet subscriptions. Internal SpaceX documents show that the company hopes to earn 60% operating profit margins  on this revenue -- which sounds like a lot because it is.”Nasdaq, Jun 9, 2024Total launches to date:373 with 330 total landings and 304 reflights.  Count includes Falcon Heavy (10 flights).",2024-09-18 00:00:00.000000

"@Money&Money,LLC  Lets see if Brazil can shoot down some satellites... lol.  Definitely glad it is Musk and not some information monopolist in charge.  Musk should set up his own base on the moon and declare his own planetary state and go totally rogue.  People can wire him whatever currency they want for free unregulated internet.   He can then use the profits to arm the moon with lasers and create a new breed of cats that really do have laser eyes.   lololol, I'm only half joking.",2024-09-18 00:00:00.000000
"I use internet on planes all the time via either free or through purchase today on Delta, United and American.This is a game changer. ZDnet, a technical magazine found the Delta/Viasat download speeds at 7mbps, which is about what I get on my Viasat connections:www.zdnet.com/...while the United/Starlink system will be at 350mbps:thepointsguy.com/...The other issue is about Viasat losing so much business to Starlink while making massive investments in satellite technology in the $1.5 billion annual range.",2024-09-15 00:00:00.000000
