"In at 72 and still holding. I caught the recent weakness and pulled the trigger. I'm not a fan of quick trades. To be fair, I'm not a trader whatsoever. If I like the company and I like the stock, I buy and I hold until I see something that bothers me.I don't see $VRT business slowing down drastically. The future is intact. This is a well run company with a lot of future growth. I'm in and I'll stay invested.",2024-10-05
"@peacewarrior I put it in a Hold for now, unless I can see a decisive breakout. It's important to note that XLI peers have surged to a new high, but not VRT yet.",2024-10-03
"@ndardick Yeah, you puts are very well timed, congrats. I agree valuing VRT is tricky.",2024-10-03
"Closed my position today. In $76, out $103 to lock in profits. However I can see this going to $160 at some point.",2024-10-03
"Valuation of VRT is tricky. I successfully sold $70 puts in early August, and harvested a nice profit fairly quickly. With the price now over $100, I don't even watch it any more.",2024-10-03
"So not quite sure what the point is? You like VRT but it's a Hold if there are lag times or delays with Footprints in this AI space?...Meanwhile in the Bat Cave, we know companies are rapidly scaling out Data Center capacity, buying land etc etc like a MSFT in this AI space and will need both major power supply increases and cooling in this infrastructure stage... No?So, sure maybe it's hold for a while during the Ebb and Flow of these build-outs is that what you mean? However, this takes nothing away from VRT long term viability. Unless I'm missing something?",2024-10-03
Still long from $76. I think we can get a little more out of it. Maybe back to $107. We’ll see how the market holds up.,2024-09-27

"Setup is in place, now we just need the follow through. Yes, it’s hot , but not too hot yet. RSI (14)	62.33 as you can see. Still in the trade at $76.45. I think it’s got some gas left in the tank. It did hit $90 intraday. I would like to see it get back to the ATH at $107 in next 2 weeks before closing the trade out. But the market doesn’t care what I want. I know.",2024-09-18
Will there be more need for this technology coupled with the new Blackwell GPUs that are designed for liquid cooling? Does Vertiv have any kind of moat in this area or is everyone doing liquid cooling?,2024-09-16
"Once again, we agree.  Short and building on pops if any.  I seem to be stuck with a nice gain before reaching my full position.  Oh well.",2024-09-13
