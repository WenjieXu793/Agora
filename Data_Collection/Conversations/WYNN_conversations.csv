Apologies: Note our reference to CZR in one of our comments about the NYC casino bids process is a transposing error. CZR one of was not involved in  the fines noted in any way. It should have read Wynn. The CZR reference was to a problem over 40 years ago for context only.,2024-10-08 11:37:19.859589

The convergence of such affluence under one roof not only creates an unparalleled atmosphere of opulence but also underscores the significant economic impact of this singular establishment.",2024-09-21 00:00:00.000000
"NYC will tax them to hell and back leaving a pittance for equity holders.  It’s a massive market but it’s not as friendly to business with the current administration.  I like the brand and quite frankly, good service is an increasing rarity these days.  I won’t invest a dime until this development is either abandoned or complete.  They are going to have to dilute or take on massive debts to achieve this and the UAE JV… not something I am interested in being a part of until after the dust settles.",2024-09-10 00:00:00.000000
