"@Jeremy LaKosh , @Tigerbond , I am informed of the event through broker fidelity in this case, ""CUSIP 912912AQ5 - S&P Rating Upgrade - UPGRADED TO CCC- ON 10/02/24."" This is for the QCF 2028 6.875%. Is this a meaningful event or just an after-the-fact confirmation already priced in? It seems the price actually dropped a little to below $70.",2024-10-02
Lumen had a very nice run and it was very profitable for me. there are risks in owning it now since it is not paying a dividend. I still like the stock and will but it back when it has a good correction to the down side.,2024-10-01
"@bondsmoker Yea, the interest rate easing we're going to see for the next year should be a big boon for the bonds and their prospects to refi. This company became too speculative for my taste a while back. It's still on my watch list, but even that is up for quarterly review.",2024-10-01
"@enron-hubbard the thesis for lumn is now not mainly about FTTH diversture imho. The major piece is AI business with long growth potential. hyper scalers will need to build tons of datacenters and all need infrasture from $lumn. They don't need to sell mass market if valuation is not perfect, they can simply collect free cash flow.",2024-09-30
"@enron-hubbard I think the assumption that $lumn will have to sell FTTH (in 1 year) may not stand. management has liquidity after the 5B to extend runway to build more fiber. and by the time they are ready to sell (in 3 years), they can enjoy a much better valuation.",2024-09-30
"For those with an interest in the potential value of LUMN's FTTH business, I would recommend a look at the FYBR proxy statement covering the sale to Verizon. This material always contains useful info regarding the process, the level of interest by others in an acquisition and the company's internal projections. My main takeaways are as follows-- In terms of interest beyond Verizon they identify ""other parties"" A- E, two of which got close to the Verizon price or represented a JV structure. There appear to have been both of TMUS and T involved at some stage in addition to financial buyers.-- they provide two sets of projections-- ""stand-alone"" and ""unconstrained capital"" scenario. The second scenario shows a far faster and wider build and, therefore significantly higher revenue and cash flow in the outer years. Anyway, interesting reading. Obviously LUMN *IS* constrained in terms of capital availability and given the slower build to date should not be expected to get a FYBR like value (8.5x EBITDA).",2024-09-30

"I like your article - reminds me when investing in Diebold Inc back in 2018-2020 timeframe.  While it is a positive to clean up the corporate balance sheet, it's more important to focus on what really matters: CUSTOMERS.",2024-09-27
"I invested in Global Crossing in the late 90’s. They were laying fiber optic cable across oceans. Couldn’t miss except it did. GC folded.Lumen is the holder of these fiber optic cables, will this time be the right time?I’m still under water with LUMN but at least it’s just 50%. Ouch! But better than 95% from earlier this year. It almost feels like I’m up. Lol.The gambler in me will let it ride since I gave I gave up hope for this company yrs ago and it is a very small position in my portfolio.GLTA",2024-09-26
"Am I missing something in the Ycharts  graph. Their TTM EBIDTA is nowhere close to what LUMN reported. (Reference LUMN's trending schedule found at ir.lumen.com/... ). There is no spike in EBIDTA, it is declining. Here are the past TTM numbers:2Q24-3.6B1Q24-3.8B4Q23-4.1B3Q23-4.1B2Q23-5.3BWhat am I missing?

"@User 35078515 Sorry. I see one cannot paste from other sources data that was supposed to appear here.The point was the fools at GoldMEN had on August 7, 2024 upgraded their ""OUTLOOK"" from SELL to NEUTRAL.Going to TENTH most UNLOVED AI stock must be a new ""OUTLOOK"" of something better, no?

They have Lumen ""Tenth on the list of unloved AI stocks""......lol....Prior to their silly article where more favorable comments like mine were ""censored"" and ""excluded"" this is where they were with OUR LUMEN:If the article is a buy rating, or bullish, which is still hard to tell since GoldMEN never tell the truth, where's the UPGRADE and an AI BASED PRICE TARGET starting at $20B ""equity valuation!""",2024-09-24
"@Bottom Fisher 2013 The gains continue to pile up. The only thing that slows Lumn is share dilution. Has to be tempting to raise cash at current price, an option not available 2 months ago",2024-09-23
"@jeffkad Don't confuse SFC with logic or rational thinking. Right now, he is very confused and wondering what he is missing. He'll capitulate when LUMN hits $10.But I can answer your question. Yes, you are on the right track. LUMN's assets are an increasingly scarcer commodity. And when something gets scarcer, its value generally rises if demand is constant. In this case, demand is actually growing, so there is a double kicker.Do your own DD.Cheers!",2024-09-23
