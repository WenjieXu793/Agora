"@El Financeiro I agree. So Disney GoG is James Gun universe extension. Now is James Gun leader of DC studios(which did not exists before WBD merge). So he will continue with Peacemaker 2 and have there more projects like Creature Comandos, Authority, Waller, Paradise Lost, Lanterns. So I believe he will bring great characters, originality and logic into DCPenguin is more like great writing, acting ala HBO Sopranos where you even don't care about DC.",2024-10-06
"@Torakichi I haven’t seen Penguin.. but it’s one I’m considering.   Unlike DC, Marvel has been able to thrive by “introducing” new characters to the mass market.  Like Guardians of the Galaxy, Ms Marvel, Iron Man, Black Panther, etc.  these were ‘B’ characters in the marvel universe.  DC regurgitates Batman and Batman characters over and over and over.  There’s only so many resets / reintroduction of Joker, Penguin, etc.    look at peacemaker that is new and unique for DC.",2024-10-06
@Herbert +H-Dog+ Kornfeld  Why did FEMA spend all its money on illegals and nothing left for hurricane victims?,2024-10-06
@El Financeiro Like current most popular TV show Penguin? Which is under DC studios logo. Joker 2 is 'elseworld' and really bad call from management to give too much freedom and money for this project.,2024-10-06
"@SeriousUsername No it does not perform well and will not perform well. Definitelly bomb, probably hard to achieve even 300M WW. But comparing to Sony's Concord, what budget are you using for Concord?",2024-10-06
These Batman reset have got to stop .  DC can try to introduce one of thousands of characters that may be lesser known but can be compelling.,2024-10-06
"What a misleading headline, insinuating this film is doing well for WarnerBrothers.It costs 10x as much as the first joker and so far made a tenth of the first jokers in sales.This thing will barely lose WB less than sony lost on concord and even that only based on hate-watchers.",2024-10-06

"@Seeking more alpha than you You were bragging about buying BABA at $141.23 while it was still in a downtrend watched it fall to the $60's now BABA is just starting to turn higher with the rest of the Chinese market and you are fighting to get back to even on your position when you could have just waited for the falling knife to finish falling and bought it when it broke its downtrend line last month at $106.12 instead.Anybody can make up stuff on the Internet and say they're up 2,000%+ on a position but a simple look at the monthly chart will tell you DIS stock is under distribution and only suckers are buying/holding it right now.",2024-10-05
It’s a bad idea for a poor country to saddle costs on streaming of creative material just to make a “buck”. I do not think it will hurt Netflix on a grand scale. Perhaps just a little though I do not know the numbers involve using these taxed companies.,2024-10-04
@The Real Cavalier I think that is a reasonable way of looking at the valuation and potential near term pricing.,2024-10-04
Strong economy.  Low unemployment.  Companies are having conferences and corporate events at Disney properties.  The Parks side of the business is setting up to surprise on the upside in Fiscal 2025.  EPS estimate of $5.20 seems low.At $5.20 with upside I think DIS is a $100 stock by year end.  $100 divided by $5.20 = a very reasonable 19.2x forward PE.,2024-10-04
"@nerd_rage The question is not if Disney can survive. They can be an arms dealer and survive on parks alone. The question is if Disney can grow with a diminishing linear business that has high margin due to non-sports fans subsidizing sports programs. And now ESPN will have to pull their own weight, not to mention the much higher price for sports rights.",2024-10-03
@SuperPac NFLX et al will just raise prices to compensate. That will knock out lower end customers but then NFLX et al can ratchet back on the content they make for those regions so it still pencils out. They can ramp up production of content for more lucrative regions.The big streaming winners like NFLX and DIS will still be winners. They'll just adjust their businesses to hostile environments. China has never let them in at all. That hasn't prevented their overall success.,2024-10-03
DIS needed to make major cuts already there living in pandemic era of overstaff and over paid for the amount of business that it generates.The longer they wait the longer the bleeding continues.To many legacy companies are dragging there butts on getting things done.Causing them to drag the stock down with it.The 3 major TV networks generate crap spending money that won't generate a good return makes no sense any longer.,2024-10-02
There’s no limit to Disney creativity when it comes to excuses for poor performance.,2024-10-02
DIS at 18x forward (Sept 25) 12 month earnings seems reasonable to a bit low.  Lots of moving parts but certainly better times ahead now that Florida fight and better movies are coming out.,2024-10-02
Disney needs to write down the value of their legacy cable networks. That entire segment is worth maybe 1/10th of what it used to be. It's borderline accounting fraud at this point.,2024-10-02
"@SuperPac - It's going to be interesting to see how they try and implement this.  For NFLX and DIS it's easy.  It's VAT and just added to the bill / passed on to the customer with almost no impact to the companies at all unless it impacts the demand price point.For search engines, mobile apps, and gaming... that is going to be harder as, in most cases, there is not a bill for the customer to pay.  They are just exploiting your data and advertising to you.   I'd like to see how they're going to VAT that...",2024-10-02
"Good move. Let's hope other nations in Asia and Africa follow suit, if they haven't already. In fact, impose higher rates on $NFLX et al. 12% seems a bit low. I would say, try a rate b/w 18% and 25%. If $NFLX wish to leave, open the gates wide for them.",2024-10-02
