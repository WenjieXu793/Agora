"@tizod - Do they even have an US auditor using our accounting standards for the Chinese operation?  I recalled the short report indicated that there was fake sale going on in China.  I meant who knows other than the stock fell off the cliff since.Then again, be my guest if you want to invest in a 23 cents stock.  Maybe you'll get lucky, maybe not.",2024-10-01
"@PN88 SO you think their auditor allowed revenue claims that didn't exist. Forget backlog - I can understand someone arguing that and how ""real"" it is (ask PLUG and a host of others). But revenue? Deloitte is CPA for them. You think they allowed vapor revenue claims? For multiple quarters in a row (maybe you can get sniuckered for a quarter, but multiple quarters???). IMHO.",2024-10-01
@Kachish - this company is like DJT which enrich the insiders at the shareholders' expense.  Those millions in backlog probably from some dudes living in a garage.  This type of backlog scam was used so often years ago in the SPAC frenzy.  I recalled there was a fake $500M EV orders from a couple of guys living in an apartment.,2024-10-01
"@tizod To me risky means its challenging to ramp up in time, or get a difficult contract. Fraud reports, crumbling leadership, and lawsuits its a whole other category and I'd personally never in a million years invest in a company like that, or describe them as risky. How can you trust these so called sales growth, especially when their customers remain mysterious and cannot be verified? They claim at one point half a billion in backlog but they never revealed who the customers were making these enormous orders. They only show some minor lose ties to iveco and a few other companies, but nothing that would explain half a billion in sales. Also its irrefutable that the CEO blatantly lied multiple times. After the DOE grant was canceled, he said the grant would have no effect on CV and that CV was already full funded. Later he said the plant was 90% complete and only minor work remained. Then in 2024 he said they don't have the money for the plant, and it's not even halfway complete. Do you really trust this same company when they claim they have rising sales within China?",2024-10-01
"@tizod - who knows what is going on with this company, but the price action is extremely negative.  It is a 25 cents stock.  Furthermore, Stephen Vogel sold 2.8M shares in the last few weeks.  So, unless you know more than him... why even bother with this stock. I've followed this company for years up til about earlier this year, and the management has zero credibility/incompetent. Take your dollar to buy a lottery tix instead.",2024-09-30
"@Kachish Granted the IR side of MVST is terrible. But I see sales growth, more sales outside China than in it, and margin improvements (but highly variable). Cost reductions (yes, people go). Plus, they did too much product and development, but now consolidated to released product. I see way worse P&L for many competitors. But the SPAC aspect causes issues, and MVST poor communications do not help. The qtr release does describe a decent story of status. Deloitte must be watching like a hawk, and the last Qtr release did not portray crashing financials - the contrary. Sales up, margins up. Agree it's risky, but they seem way better off than many others with valuations that are higher but outcomes (and revenue) far worse. We shall see, but I imagine anyone interested in them let's it go BK if that shall be the result. However, if they keep selling at margin, they might make it. Issue is, customers leave if you can't support/replace batteries....double edged sword.",2024-09-30
"@tizod Not sure what's hard to get. They lost a DOE grant because they are heavily based in China, production, workforce, even customers and sales which can't be verified etc. Then there was a well done fraud report by weeks of surveillances and interviews that showed their overseas production was drastically lower than what they claimed. Soon after an insider dumped over a million shares, knowing they would not go higher.The company did nothing to contradict these damaging claims, except a walk through the cafeteria and never mentioned it again. Soon after the CEO lied and said that their US factory was fully funded and nearly complete, then in 2024 said it wasn't even halfway done and they not only don't have the money, but now have liens against them for non payment to contractors.Lots of senior leadership left. Lots of people were laid off. Factories closed. The company has been ghosting its investors for much of this time, except when mandated by law to release information. Thet this month insiders sold millions more shares under 30 cents, knowing they will never go higher. It's amazing the stock is as high as it is now and not already zero.",2024-09-30
"I don't get it. They are getting contracts, have real production and seem to have more to offer than most battery companies. Plus they are more industrial, so not into the consumer car market issues. USA siting is a drag, but costs seems to have been slowed (ended almost?) while awaiting investment. But if needed could ramp faster than most. A sub-dollar stock? With path to profitability? No SA activity to speak of? Logical buyout candidate for someone needing quick production ramp?  I don't get it.",2024-09-14
