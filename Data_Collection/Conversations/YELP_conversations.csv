"Google reviews are not valuable because they don't have the YELP propriety software that moves most (but not all) fake reviews to the ""not recommended,"" folder that anyone can look at but are not counted or up front.  That software is really powerful and is really what makes YELP great. Google is replete with mainly fake reviews or reviews that are pumped by the businesses.I use YELP exclusively unless it's that rare situation that the business in not listed on YELP, but is on Google--you find this with some out of USA locations that YELP does not operate.If you want to find out the truth use YELP and don't give a lot of weight to reviewers that have less than 10 reviews.  Sort by ""Elites.""  Google should get out of the review business--they are not any good and are not policing the reviews.  They are not helping anyone and are misleading consumers.Disclosure--I own many Google Shares,  don't own any YELP.",2024-09-08
"Google tried to acquire yelp years ago and they blew them off.  If the app and service is good people will use it.  I use Booking all the time for hotels, not Google.  But for finding businesses and reviews Google is better than yelp.",2024-08-29
@DanOB Not if they successfully contribute to the prevention of Google being a monopoly,2024-08-29
"It is ironic Yelp is taking the lead on this but they are a great example of ""It takes one to know one"".  Google has now made organic and most relevant search results secondary to advertising.  I have seen companies that were in unique businesses for 50 years (long before the internet) with a moat get decimated and go out of business because of fraudulent companies that use fake reviews and google ads to take market share.  You want proof Google is failing, look at the number of advertisers competing in their ad space, it's declining as the largest companies take up all the market share which Google clearly will compromise to the highest bidder.  Google is making their advertising space the same as the days when only Coke and Pepsi were your beverage choices everywhere you went.",2024-08-29
"Not taking from a legal standpoint, but from a customer of Yelp and a business owner, I hope Yelp gets thrown out and ordered to pay Google damages for giving a bad name to searched advertisement.I also hope business owners will get a class-action lawsuit against Yelp someday for running a shakedown business as they run so many shady practices.At least Google is effective and don't lie to your face.Yelp need to learn that you *can* run a successful business even if Google exists if you are truly superior in your service. Yelp is not an example of that.",2024-08-29
@JPevzner lol this is exactly why Yelp sues: Google eats all the traffic and monopolize the adds business.,2024-08-29
"Yelp is a POS… tried advertising with them for several months, got minimal results. Now I only use Google Ads and it’s been amazing. Hoping Yelp keeps getting strangled and goes out of business soon!",2024-08-29
Yelp is a failed company that can only make money by suing others. Kinda like Epic Games...,2024-08-29
