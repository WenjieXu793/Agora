@Badjuan I think you have to decide whether you follow fundamentals or technical or something else. Then you invest based on the findings derived from your approach. Otherwise you will get thoroughly confused. I hold stocks for 6 to 8 years and I do not know how you can look so far ahead if you don't look at fundamentals.,2024-10-03
"I see that your last recommendation on CRS (Nov 2023) also provided a sell rating.  The stock price has risen 140% since then.  The track record of analysts is also something to be considered.  Sometimes we get so wrapped up in our detailed analysis (the leaves) that we miss the forest.  I have a lot of respect for Cathy Woods who seems to be driven more by her thesis and less by fundamentals.  Consequently, ARKK has been a disaster.  Fundamentals, Technicals, and a stocks behavior to a host of contextual matters is our best indicator of the future.  It's always a gamble but if we stick to this we come out winners most of the time.",2024-10-03
"Carpenter operates in a niche segment of the steel industry, producing very hiqh quality alloy steel, esp. nickel based alloys for use in high temperature applications.  There is no correlation between Carpenter products with hot-rolled, plain carbon steel bar, plate or structural shape products.  I believe that there is a correlation between Carpenter revenue with gas turbine, aerospace structures, and ballistic missile component sales.  I find your writing and analysis thorough, interesting and relevant.  I appreciate your willingness to critically assess previous analysis for bench marking.",2024-09-25
"Interesting assessment, and especially given that an earlier covered call option for a third of our holding was exercised at the current stratosphere valuation.  I still think that this performance and specialty metals producer can out perform over the longer term.  Reshoring is one of several trends that should support volume growth.  Yet, as you noted, the present valuation appears out of touch with reality.",2024-09-24
Bad call. Traded at 68 at the time of this report. Just hit 150 less than a year later.,2024-09-18
