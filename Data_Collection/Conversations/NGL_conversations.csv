"@CashFlow Hunter The Series B preferred is benchmarked to SOFR, the Series C is benchmarked to LIBOR.  Can anyone explain why NGL common is down 20% YTD when the larger market cap comps are up double digits YTD?",2024-09-19
"Hmmm - If the preferred C is 3 mo Libor +7.384%, and the B is 3 mo Libor +7.213% why is the current declaration for the B a bit higher than the C?TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 19, 2024--NGL Energy Partners LP (NYSE: NGL) announced today that the Board of Directors of its general partner declared a distribution for the quarter ending September 30, 2024 to be paid to the holders of the Partnership’s 12.806% Class B Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (“Class B Preferred Units”) and the 12.716% Class C Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (“Class C Preferred Units”) in accordance with the terms outlined in NGL’s partnership agreement.

"@GuyRien1 The current distribution rate for the Class B Preferred Units is a floating rate of the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) interest rate (5.3314% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024) plus a spread of 7.213%. A change in interest rates of 0.125% would result in an increase or decrease of our Class B Preferred Unit distribution of $0.1 million, based on the Class B Preferred Units outstanding at March 31, 2024. Effective July 3, 2023, the reference to LIBOR in the formulation for the distribution rate in these securities was replaced with three-month CME Term SOFR, as calculated and published by CME Group Benchmark Administration, Ltd., plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161% in accordance with the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (“LIBOR Act”), and the rules implementing the LIBOR Act.On April 15, 2024, the distributions for the Class C Preferred Units will accumulate at a percentage of the $25.00 liquidation preference equal to the applicable three-month LIBOR interest rate (or alternative rate as determined in accordance with our amended and restated limited partnership agreement (“Partnership Agreement”)) plus a spread of 7.384%.",2024-09-16
