"This is an amazing growth story vastly superior to WalMart but a long way to go before able to compete with $low Lowe's and $hd Home Depot but is moving in the right direction to do just that thanks to the truly epic move away from the internal combustion engine by US consumers creating very advanced ICE platform product now very much available for farm and garden use. Most important are now battery electric pickup trucks hitting the US market in volume only right just now Q4 for the first time 2024 and this will cause a very positive change in farm and ranch economics first since large ""super duty"" trucks first appeared on this market back in the 1990s from Ford, Dodge and GM. Now currently in addition to these three is Tesla, Rivian and possibly Toyota hard to tell with the troubles there at the moment but yes as battery electric vehicle sales soar in Q4 2024 the availability of internal combustion engine for Farm and Ranch vastly more available and improved upon also true in the construction market as noted for example by new Kubota equipment now out and working with push button start (no more keys) and electronic fuel injection (no more carburetors.) this is all much more friendly for users of biofuels is why this matters. Also no starting to add ""codes"" on the machines for creating for the first time an actual service management system. Taken together all of this can very much vastly reduce downtime while at the same time increasing the capabilities of what used to be fairly benign ""tools"" such as tractors and tracked loaders. They also offer full enclosure of the cab now so that creates year around operation potential so in theory crazy productive machinery with sudden jump in demand at ""The Tractor Supply.""Ace Hardware a big competitor needs noting however and to all of this as well as Farmer coops.",2024-10-05
@Kirk Spano In order to get back to better there may be some resistance but that bit of resistance is far better for the future than the destruction we are seeing now.,2024-10-02

"@golfcat1 we ought to control the border, but, we ought to be issuing enough work visas and green cards to offset Boomer retirements. That requires millions of immigrants per year.",2024-10-01
@santlo It won't. Markets will tank if the weird guys take over. They are a threat to democracy and capitalism.,2024-09-30
"@erbrown Don’t bet the farm on that. I don’t see cap gain tax on unrealized gains. For openers, evaluations are impossible, not only for the likes of farm land but also for 1000 shares of a publicly-traded stock, liquidity is a big deal. Then there’s the velue of the local family business. Not so fast.",2024-09-29
Stock Market at record levels under Biden-Harris …why will change  to Trump be better for market?,2024-09-29
@slodon28 of course it will - just ask Milton Friedman. Spending leads to inflation (Why I sold any bond holding/ blended fund before 2022). Don't make this so hard.,2024-09-16
@TJ Burke Wont all of that NEW that government spending increase inflation?,2024-09-16
Spending will take off again under Harris. All her initiatives require new spending. It's objective reality and your lack of policy awareness or shallow partisanship does not change it.,2024-09-15

"@Brucejfern Having owned $MAIN, $ARCC, $OBDC, etc., in the past, I now think $PBDC or $BIZD (the ETFs with nice dividends) is the best way to participate in this sector. Spread the risk. Pay a little extra in fees. Sleep well at night. Remember to hold this in a tax deferred account since these dividends ARE NOT qualified.",2024-09-10
@Simon Chatham  Fact checking will show you are correct in the record amount of oil being pumped. Just shows what distraction can do to people's perception. Edit: forgot link.www.eia.gov/...,2024-09-10
