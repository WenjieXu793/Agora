"Interesting analysis of PG.  Thanks for the write-up. I hold PG, but  not adding at this time.  No margin of safety for new money -- even with recent pullback. https://shorturl.at/XEEUd",2024-10-06
I want to own more PG but since my average price is $80.90 the current price isn't appealing. I might not ever buy more since I wouldn't consider it for anything more than $130.,2024-10-06
"Valuation high on dividend king PG, holding shares not adding at this time.",2024-10-06
"""....the recent price pullback has offered an attractive entry point for this blue-chip dividend champion"".I agree that PG is always a Buy on a pullback. Except I don't see anything that would resemble a sufficient pullback. After hitting its all-time high on September 10th, PG stock retreated and now traded at $169. However, even after this drop, PG's valuation remains somewhat elevated. Forward P/E is 24.2, and a dividend yield of 2.4% further indicates that it's not the best time to buy. The discounted cash flow model suggests that PG's fair value estimate is $143. Buying PG at these valuations probably won't be your worst investing decision. And yet, I prefer to practice patience and restraint. Mr. Market will offer an opportunity to buy PG at more attractive valuations.",2024-10-06
"Dip? What dip?  Sorry, PG is way overvalued right now.",2024-10-06
Thank you for the reminder! I need to add to this 15 year plus position.. one I forget about as it just chugs along with rising dividends!,2024-10-06
I chose PG over KMB and CLX in 2022.  No regrets. Long PG.,2024-09-09
I have long term holdings in both PG and UL (since 2005 for PG and 2014 for UL).  Do you view UL as a forever holding like PG for the same reasons in this article or do you view UL differently?  UL was one of my worst performers for years and I am considering finally dumping it. Both are in retirement accounts so I wonâ€™t have capital gains taxes nor do I pay taxes in dividends.,2024-09-09
