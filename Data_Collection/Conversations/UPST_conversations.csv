"UPST.  Keep your eye on it. Been in this one for a while and it’s been a struggle. Good above $38.16. Resistance $47. Now trading above all its major moving averages I have a position at $39.31, although $36 would have been a better entry.",2024-10-05
"@Michael Wiggins De Oliveira changed mind, recently sold UPST into strength. bought PGY into weakness. UPST is a meme stock and might even moon with trashy fundamentals. although i do think they will improve significantly after rate cuts.still, PGY fundamentals have been managed so much better than UPST in the last 2 years (yes, the stock price was managed poorly). yes, net debt is rising. but gross profit growing nicely and on the edge of becoming FCF+. also very low short interest seems to agree with low bancrupty-risk.feel free to give me flames for buying PGY. dont have a crystal ball. might have been a trash call. wish the UPST holders all the best!",2024-10-05
"So Upst is still subject to rate cycle . It is not an ai in controlling default rate yet . Where are the billion of cells managing the risk , I concern the bond price rise too fast now",2024-09-25
Last time fed was in an easing cycle what did UPST stock do? Will this time be any different. This is the question.,2024-09-24
Ok . But valuation matters for me . What the best they can do? Reverse the loss and start earning some cents ? It is still very expensive in my view.,2024-09-24
Thanks for the article.  Ultimately if their tech delivers better numbers than traditional FICO lending metrics for loan defaults it will pan out.  This inflation and interest rate episode has been tough.,2024-09-20
"Unfortunately, UPST primary low-end customer is on life-support economically-- Decade-high credit card delinquencies-Decade-high auto loan delinquency and loan defaultsInterest rates don't matter if legal citizens are losing jobs at the low-mid, and low-end range---",2024-09-18
"Hi @Dilantha De Silva, Thanks for your article. Do you have any other thoughts/color on the latest round convertible senior note? Or, perhaps an updated article?",2024-09-18
@Danjw2 2029 is far enough out too.Hopefully rates are nearer zero by then.,2024-09-17
"I don't know a lot about these kinds of deals, but 2% interest and a conversion rate that implies a stock price of $45.66 sounds good to me.",2024-09-17

Smart to try to get the convert done now to secure refinancing of the old converts after pumping the stock with the positive EBITDA guidance.  Clear signal from management they don't think they will see a better stock price to issue equity-linked notes between now and when the old notes are due in less than 2 years.  They scrambled to get this out the door as soon as they saw the last pump fading.,2024-09-16
@Abcd8 absolutely and I think you can genuinely widen that range $5-$400The most volatile of stocks,2024-09-15
"You make very fair points and clearly articulate the numbers and the numbers don’t lie. This is a financially risky business that is totally dependent on a soft landing scenario, which includes the consumer and the economy remaining resilient. But you know what I find curious?  Why financial institutions are increasing their stakes in UPST? You would think they would steer clear of this. But they are not. Maybe the stock topped out at $45 back in last August. Maybe the fed decision next week is going to be a sell the news event and that’s why it sold back down to $32. But now, they are buying it back. This stock is not for the conservative investor. But, you can de-risk somewhat by keeping an underweight position. This is what I have done for both UPST and TREE. Both of these should do well in a falling interest rate environment. We’ll see. Bank of New York Mellon Corp lifted its position in Upstart Holdings, Inc.  by 15.3% in the 2nd quarter, according to the company in its most recent disclosure with the Securities & Exchange Commission. The fund owned 272,430 shares of the company's stock after purchasing an additional 36,206 shares during the quarter. Bank of New York Mellon Corp owned about 0.31% of Upstart worth $6,427,000 as of its most recent SEC filing.Other institutional investors and hedge funds have also recently modified their holdings of the company. Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc. increased its stake in shares of Upstart by 3.1% in the fourth quarter. Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc. now owns 573,176 shares of the company's stock worth $23,420,000 after acquiring an additional 17,463 shares during the period.",2024-09-14
"The interesting side of UPST is that the share price can go either to $10 or $100 :)The uncertainty and volatility is so huge that buying shares does not seem to be investing.If a recession will emerge, the share price will crash.",2024-09-14
"Once credit markets are rejuvenated on interest rate cuts, the stock will surpass $100 easily.If you listened to last few CC's :-costs have been cut to the bone, meaning much more op leverage. This will be reflected in results in the dec quarter at the latest. -the AI credit appraisal model has been refined massively through the most tumultous rate cycle in 4 decades; listen to CEO on the change in accuracy, plus its value as a leading indicator -CEO has never been so ebullient as in last CC, and that's before downward phase in rates.-there are few co's that have MONETISED the hype on AI as well as Upstart. This is bound to receive more investor attention.First stop $100, I guess in < 1year.",2024-09-14
"Setting aside everything else in the article, the following caught my attention:“Readers must also note that UPST…insiders continuing to sell over the last twelve months.”If the implication is that insider selling reflects their outlook on the business rather than other reasons, such as options or tax-related matters, it's worth noting that if this were the case, the CFO would not have sold a significant portion of his shares at prices between $12 and the low $20s (which is considerably more than what he's sold between the high $20s and low $30s). Additionally, the CFO, along with all other insiders, including the CEO and co-founders, still collectively own about 15% of the company. This suggests a long-term commitment rather than a lack of confidence in the business.",2024-09-14
I would only buy this company under $20. Been following this for 2 years.  Still no significant change funding their loans.  That makes me think at a minimum that it simply isn't a value added product.  So if their loans don't perform any better just keep those origination loan fees and use FICO scores.,2024-09-14
It’s going to $70-$80. It did last time they thought interest rates were going to be cut. It’s not fundamentals it’s just momentum. I meant to get in at $ 23. I’m in now though at 33-$35,2024-09-13
I just bought it because I expect a flurry of re-financing activity after interest rates start to drop. The downside narrative appears tougher to justify.,2024-09-13
