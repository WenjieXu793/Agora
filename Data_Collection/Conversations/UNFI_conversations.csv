@Kingdom Capital I think that UNFI is going to be a good stock to own long-term. They've leveraged themselves into a really important market niche.,2024-10-01

Has anyone by chance ever thought about the possibility of Amazon buying UNFI for distribution capacity and as a way to further compete with Walmart? I know that Amazon has stopped buying distribution centers for the most part but... it seems like Amazon was also kind of going a bit crazy and buying up any distribution center it could. UNFI's distribution network would make a lot more sense as a buy for Amazon since they already supply Whole Foods and could possibly help Amazon compete with Walmart's grocery delivery services.,2024-09-19
"@JLegacy33 I have an ambitious $100+ PPS target for $UNFI based on:- UNFI has a lack of viable competition and a very wide moat with over 50 distribution centers and counting- their continued investments into ai/robotics at these warehouses will lead to significant profit margin increases over time, especially with additional scale- their renewed eight-year contract extension with Amazon/Whole Foods should bring in steady cashflow for years while they (hopefully) continue to add more great partners. In my opinion, this not only reduces the risk of defaulting or having to pay down debt unexpectedly, but should also give investors comfort in making continued investments as needed to hold the upward trend for years to come- UNFI does a lot more than just food delivery; they are actively creating an end-to-end ecosystem for food/grocery startups to quickly launch and grow their business more efficiently using only UNFI software/networking/partnerships etc... as opposed to going out and doing this all on their own like in the past. As this gains traction, I imagine that *most* food brands, big and small, will have an UNFI account in the future to take advantage of the many benefits it will offer given UNFI's vast reach among retailers and consumers alike. If you think of UNFI more of a food platform than anything else, the opportunities are endless. For example, launching a DTC offering coupled with a food-focused digital ad network is totally in the cards with the right leadership.My shares are essentially locked up in the meantime and I have no rush to get to $100/share or higher any time soon. The only question on my mind is ""when will UNFI get there?""",2024-09-19
