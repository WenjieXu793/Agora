"@jarratta : ""Why do you go out of your way to be antagonistic?""--- Not ""antagonistic""; I do not threaten or flame. What I DO, is attempt to expose the truth--especially truths that people don't want to acknowledge. That is not hatefulness; it is honesty. True, I don't like Ford products; but I come by that dislike through personal experience with MULTIPLE Ford products. I have come to feel the same way about GM products, too... and I used to be a loyal buyer, especially of Oldsmobile products but also Chevy and Saturn.I have acknowledged that Ford makes vehicles people WANT... But I've also seen that most people who buy a Ford out of the showroom tend to trade when the warranty expires. Why? I've seen this happen for over 60 years, as even as a child, I watched family friends who LOVED their Ford products... trade... every three years... no matter what. Again, why? All I can say is that when talking to such people, they almost always tell me that their cars were starting to have problems even BEFORE the warranty ran out... and one such person I know recently traded their one-year-old Mustang because of multiple, repeating, issues. That fits my own experiences with Ford products. And when just keeping one running has a monthly cost equivalent to the payment on a new car... why try to keep the older one going?",2024-10-06
"@Russell24 Is the 5% dividend alone enough for you? There are many companies and other types of investments which pay dividends greater than 5%. Would you be more satisfied with a company which pays a 5% dividend and has an increasing rather than a decreasing stock price?  Or is price appreciation something you avoid?Can you suggest something Ford can implement to improve its stock price, down from $12.19 per share on 01/03/24 to $10.57 per share today?",2024-10-06
@jarratta Should provide them some time to introduce a few more new hybrids.  And Ford Pro should be able to improve Ford's EBIT further.  Am writing to the Ford Treasury Dept with a proposal to negotiate a RLOC (Revolving Line of Credit) for the purpose of creating a reserve for Ford Model E. The structure will be interest only payments for three years (providing Ford with a tax deduction for the annual interest payments made) followed by five years of P&I payments for the following five years.  This may be a secured or unsecured loan.Have both negotiated and authored many of these over the years.  Ford is still rated at the lowest level of investment grade by the three major credit agencies. Hopefully by the end of the three- year period Model E will be much closer to breakeven while Blue and Pro will be even more profitable. Many of these RLOCs are also often extended or renewed if necessaryMr. Farley needs to bring Ford Treasury into the equation to assist Model E.,2024-10-05
"@Rhoda711 Factorial might be buying electrolyte product from SLDP.  It's vexing that SLDP is mum about # of customers, volumes shipped and other stats regarding this side of its business.  Factorial might also be buying electrolyte matl from this nonpublic company:  www.ampcera.com/... I was mightily impressed  that Factorial had: produced 100ah solid state cells; and, shipped 1K of them to Mercedes.  There are many companies working overtime on next gen EVbatteries.  We'll find out if SLDP's efforts are competitive. You're welcome .",2024-10-05
@jarratta  I think you're right. I know SK was to have a big presence at Blue Oval City,2024-10-05
@Rhoda711 F is certainly expiring a range of next gen battery tech.  It has a teensy investment in SLDP.  Other companies like privately held Factorial (www.businesswire.com/...-an-All-Solid-State-Battery-with-Mercedes-Benz-as-a-Key-Customer-and-Development-Partner) may be eclipsing its first mover advantage.,2024-10-05
@Stewart Foreman I too am confused.  The LFP Battery Park in MI (corporate.ford.com/...) was initially a JV with CATL.  There was silly political pushback.  I don't think F can (or wants to) do LFP sans CATL.Its other big foreign partner has long been SK who appears to be retrenching (www.ft.com/...).  I am unclear about the status of Blue Oval.  Clearly the next gen pickup (T3) is on hold media.ford.com/... but I don't know the status of commissioning non-truck products there.,2024-10-05
@Risk Advisor The Street is not know for patience.  F's investments are just beginning to ramp.  The LFP battery plant in MI won't be commissioned until '26 (corporate.ford.com/...).  The Blue Oval factories in KY & TN (https://www.blueovalsk.com) were originally slated for commissioning in '25 (media.ford.com/...).  F has recently scaled back those efforts (media.ford.com/...).  The biggest limitation here is that a roadmap to next gen battery tech is not a available.,2024-10-05
"@Bob-in-DE The study I pointed you to has nothing whatsoever to do with ""depletion write offs"". It’s about the billions in damage that fossil fuels cause that alternative energy sources would not.  Billions that taxpayers have to cover so that fossil fuels can keep pretending to be ""cheap"" energy.You’re watching one major case of this on your nightly news this week.  Who do you think funds the hundreds of millions FEMA spends getting families back on their feet again after the latest superflood?  These megastorms are happening four times as often now as in 1980, due to warming the planet.Same thing for the costs of fighting the western wildfires that have also quadrupled since the 70s.  And many other types of health and infrastructure damage.  These are the implicit subsidies the annual IMF study is tabulating.  Maybe take an actual look at it.",2024-10-05

@J Kimmel what's the resale or trade-in value compared to ICE cars?,2024-10-05

@Bob-in-DE that's your opinion. There are taxi EVs on their original battery with 400k+ miles. Why you think Amazon is switching its delivery fleet to EV. Cause it's cheaper to operate.,2024-10-04
"@J Kimmel I have owned cars for 50 years.  I have never had to replace an engine.  But if I had it would have made economic sense.  The cost is not as great as one might think.EV record is atrocious.  The ""engines"", which is to say the batteries, have a high failure rate.  Replacement is a 20k+ proposition,  No one will replace a battery on an EV.  They will scrap the car.  They will probably have to pay someone to take it away.Even if you come from the ""saving the planet"" crowd, EVs are not the way to do it.  It's really time for the country to grow up on this issue.",2024-10-04
"@J2568 Real estate houses and rentals have been increasing in value for years.  In many metro areas builders have kept the supply quite low while raising the prices steadily to meet demand.There is no Federal or State mandate to build.  In many inner cities, the properties/houses are sold to out of State landlords who immediately turn the properties into rentals.Have read that in some cities particularly Pennsylvania, mayors in places like Pittsburgh and Harrisburg are raising taxes quickly on vacant land.Some inner cities have begun building large quantities of manufactured homes to keep the prices down for their residents.Not like the ups and downs in the stock market.  Things like a possible wiping out of Tel Aviv by Iran tomorrow might cause a nice 15% drop in one's ""liquid investments"" in one day.",2024-10-04
@Risk Advisor we actually build them. The typical hold is about 44 months. You do raise a really interesting point that a mentor of mine taught many years ago. As investors we pay a tremendous price for liquidity in terms of costs and diminished returns. It’s certainly held true for me over the years. My long term investments that lacked liquidity have been far more lucrative then my liquid investments,2024-10-04
