@MustangsFinance in my opinion the change shouldn't be very large as ANSS is not contributing to growth and margin expansion is priced in/expected regardless of the acquisition closing or not.,2024-09-23
What is Synopis’ long term value if they can’t close?,2024-09-23
@Christophe vds I think it is much more attractive at the current price vs when I initially wrote (~$580). I’d be a buyer here personally.,2024-09-11
@The Value Edge Great article! So in your opinion is it a buy today at around 460-470? It looks like a clear yes to me but I was wondering on your opinion since you stated you were looking for a better price entry point,2024-09-10
@Christophe vds institutions bought millions after hours today.  It’s a good deal at $465,2024-09-09
"@bluescorpion0 But considering their future growth traject and historical P/E the stock isn't actually that expensive at the moment. I thought this dip would have been bought. I bought today anyways, I don't think I end up regretting it",2024-09-09
"Why isn't SNPS being bought at prices of today around 460? I think this is a great buy or is there something here that I am misssing? In case we do hit a recession is SNPS very much affected by it maybe? I actually read it is quite the opposite and it is a relative safe bet in such a case. If anyone can fil me in what's going on,  thanks",2024-09-09
