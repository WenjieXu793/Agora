@BAHAMAS1 We literally just rated IBM a sell for the first time. You know what they say - 'Sell High'. No point in selling IBM at lows.,2024-10-06
@bob_va We'll see how much money they actually make from AI going forward,2024-10-06
"@Natturner1966 Agreed it will be their bread and butter, but a lot of it will be cannibalized from the current 'digital transformation' segment as most companies are now aligned for a digital future. We'll see where it ends up but the growth is anemic compared with investor perception of AI trends.",2024-10-06
Some strong points made here. IBM stock should be one of the first casualties when this AI stock boom hits a correction phase.,2024-10-05
"Hold a few residual shares, they'll make a real comeback one of these decades.",2024-10-05
Perhaps they should ask Watson which is the best path forward.,2024-10-05
Generally prefer my AI tech plays not being on the NYSE.   Boomer AF.,2024-10-04
"""author""11 out of the last 18 trading days IBM has made ALL-TIME  HIGHS, including today with a close of $226.00 up $3.28  or  +1.47%I guess your SELL CALL ""timing"" is off ...QUITE A bit !",2024-10-04
"Thanks for the tip.I don't know that IBM has innovated a darned thing in over twenty years.Watson and Deep Blue were good publicity projects at the time, but resulted in no revenue.Being a follower in AI is unlikely to become a major revenue source.",2024-10-04
Take profits and fell lucky as they still have bad management.,2024-10-04
@BAHAMAS1 I agree.  bought at $119 and I'm not selling till FV 277,2024-10-04
"@bob_va Totally agree.The ""street"" seems to forget about the $$$$ buffett (their demigod) left on the table by selling IBM. Nobody talks about that !Hmmmm",2024-10-04
Bought IBM when Warren Buffett sold. Up over 85% since then and getting that 3% dividend yield. Not too bad. I wonder whether he regrets selling IBM? Maybe he’ll buy it again. They’ll be a well capitalized player in the AI business for awhile. GLTA the IBM longs out there!,2024-10-03
Did you not hear Jensen Huang remarks yesterday about his  AI factory business and AI industrialization? Nvidia is partnering with Accenture. I’m pretty sure more consulting firms (like IBM) are going to get involved as well. Here is the interview just in case you missed it. youtu.be/...,2024-10-03
"Well, the AI consulting business should be their bread and butter for the next 10+ years. There is no reason why it shouldn’t continue to grow when 99% of companies haven’t even started doing anything AI yet. I know, I’m an IT consultant. No position. I’m rolling with ACN and waiting for this to pullback to $200",2024-10-03
Biggest upside for IBM is The Fed started cutting before a lot of IBM debt had to be refied.,2024-10-02
"Bought it long ago when Buffett bought it then bailed out, turned out as I predicted to be a blockbuster. All you had to was wait it out while collecting that fabulous dividend",2024-10-02
@phexac Yep.. In life it does not take alot of winners just some good ones.,2024-10-01
"Growth????? I see about as much growth here as in ATT. '21 revenues were 57B. '25 revenues are supposed to be 66B. I see at most 4% annual growth here. That, a growth stock does not make. It's a great stock for people that like things like Intel. I mean maybe the 80s are coming back. It could happen...",2024-10-01
@Bay Area Ideas I agree this is a purchase on the future not the past! While you wait you collect really nice dividends!! I do wish they had alot less debt!,2024-10-01
