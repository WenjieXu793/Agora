"@Huck Farris Thanks Huck, yes I agree that the dividend growth angle is the angle from which this stock looks the best. The good thing about PAYX future dividend growth is that it's fairly certain given the stability of the business. Not so good is that I don't think there's much upside to the guided ~10% dividend growth, given my doubts about sustainable margin expansion and the already high payout ratio. 10% is not to be sniffed at though. Dividend growth investors could do an awful lot worse.",2024-09-12
"Agree with some aspects of his article. While the current yield on PAYX is unspectacular, the dividend growth rate is gold-plated and total return has matched or exceeded the S&P over most time horizons. Now is not the best time to open a new position in PAYX but a current, DGI oriented stockholder would be hard pressed to find a better substitute in his portfolio.",2024-09-12
