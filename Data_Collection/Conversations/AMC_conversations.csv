@stupidguy2023 I'd love to see the math behind your price target,2024-09-27
@Elephant Analytics also read this interview that provides context to the article you quotedwww.boxofficepro.com/...This is not 2.2B of new capex.   This is what the top 8 chains are spending.   The board has said capex will remain at 175-225 unless it something immediately accreditation.   Your adding capex cost out of context in your analysis,2024-09-26
"@Elephant Analytics I’m referring to the link you provided.   The numbers did indeed provide a start of year estimate of 8.4, then revised to 8.3.   www.the-numbers.com/...However this projection of end of year box office is updated based on numbers to date.   In the weaker start of the quarter the projected number was sub 7.  It’s now pushed up to 8.3 on the strength of q3.   Check back in a few weeks and it will update again.",2024-09-26
@Elephant Analytics You can use box office mojo for more accurate revenue. YTD www.boxofficemojo.com/... is just 800million behind 2023 with a big weekend to add another 100million. Q4 2023 was less than 2billion. Q4 2024 is going to be 2.6 billion plus so all in all we should end very near to 2023. With some good luck we will beat 2023 also.  While next year every quarter should be greater than 2.5 billion given the movie slate. We should be easily around £10.5 billion next year at box office.,2024-09-26
"@Thatguy2 I don't believe you are providing accurate information. Please provide your source for the Numbers having a sub-$7 billion forecast for 2024.  The Numbers forecast $8.4 billion in 2024 domestic box office in December 2023, and reduced that to $8.3 billion in early 2024.  Source: www.the-numbers.com/...",2024-09-25
@Elephant Analytics no information from the amc board has come out about growth capex increases.  AMC was very clear on capex levels in earning calls earlier this year.  I’ll wait until I hear a shift in their strategy.  Nearly 2B was spent on capex improving theatres in ‘17-‘19.   They are ahead of the curve.The numbers estimates total domestic box office based on ticket sale trajectory so far.   That number was sub 7 billion at the start of the year with the strike impacted slate and has steadily been increasing every few weeks through q3 as the industry is moving past the impact.  Dbo will be 6.2B by the end of q3 where q3 looks to end just under 2.7B.  Q4 is projected larger.   There is zero chance the dbo for q4 ends at 2B.  Depending on how movies perform your looking at 2.5-3 for the final q if you dig in,2024-09-25
"Your article seems too negative about AMC. While there are better investments out there, AMC is in a solid position right now. Q3 2024 is likely to be EPS positive, and the debt is slowly decreasing. Even with the recent stock dilutions, the number of shares is about the same as in 2021, when the stock shot up to $72, thanks to the 10:1 reverse split in 2023. I don’t see why box office revenue should drop below $2.5 billion per quarter, especially since we’re already close to $2.6 billion in Q3 2024, even in a tough year for movies. Market manipulation has always affected meme stocks, as some big investors seem to take a grudge against retail traders. While I’m not a fan of the meme stock crowd due to their unrealistic expectations, AMC’s main issue is its debt, which is being handled slowly but surely. The company isn’t going bankrupt and should stay profitable from here on out. The stock will eventually improve, but the market can be unpredictable and take its time.",2024-09-25
"@Thatguy2 Movie theater chains are expected to invest $2.2 billion into upgrading theaters over the next three years. AMC has around 1/3rd of the screens in questions, so proportionately that would be `~$700 million over three years.Maintenance capex would be ~$400 million over three years, so you're looking at ~$1.1 billion capex for AMC from 2025 to 2027.qz.com/...As for the 2024 domestic box office, current projections have it finishing at around $8.2 billion.www.the-numbers.com/...",2024-09-25
"There’s been no comment for amc outside of earnings calls that capex will be over 175-225M.   Look at capex from 2017-2019.  They already rebranded and upgraded all their acquired theatres 5-7 years ago.  Capex should remain in line, outside of accreditive growth capex from Dolby/imax installs.   In addition, 2024 looks like it will get close to 9B.   Every earnings call from amc/imax/cnk are all stating 25/26 will be “billions” better.  25 should be 10B plus.  You can look at the huge increase in releases to see this already.  And 26 by all accounts looks to be even better pushing 11B.   AMC by these account should be ttm fcf positive by q2 next year at the latest, and fcf postive full year 2025 and moving forward.",2024-09-24
@Brad Foxx Historically it has been a pretty poor investment due to the massive dilution needed to deal with the cash burn caused by the pandemic. AMC looks to be in a position now where (outside of the exchangeable note conversion) it should be able to avoid massive dilution.,2024-09-24
@Brad Foxx  nonsense. All the negatives are priced in. Buying now should yield a 50% gain in 6-12 months.,2024-09-22
said it before so i might as well say it again there are some great films in the pipeline for the end of 24 and quite a large number in 25.. the people are coming back and have been coming back for some time now.. the corruption in the US stock markets are off the scale with hundreds of fines handed out every year when they have to we are well aware that they are all complicit in this scam from politicians with their gratefully accepted payments (sorry campaign donations) to multi billionaire Griffin going on camera and gleefully saying we set the price of stocks... whatever happened to supply and demand hey,2024-09-15
"AMC has recently restructured its debt, effectively eliminating concerns about bankruptcy. The box office has bounced back, and by all indications, Q3 2024 is shaping up to be the strongest quarter since the pandemic. Despite domestic sales falling short of $2 billion in Q2 2024, AMC posted only a minor loss. Q3 2024 is expected to be profitable, with earnings per share (EPS) projected at $0.25 or higher. Many analysts, often freelancers, tend to cling to a particular perspective and repeat it. Back in 2021, AMC, with 550 million shares, surged to $72, and with the new debt deal, we could see a similar share count. It's true that CEO Adam Aron has issued new shares several times, and the APE initiative didn't perform as well as hoped in hindsight. However, that difficult period is now behind us. The stock may take some time to rise, as markets can stay irrational longer than we might expect. While there's certainly an opportunity cost to staying invested in AMC, and other, perhaps better, opportunities exist, AMC is no longer the 'dead dog' it was once perceived to be.",2024-09-12
"@Clark158f1 standby take note of 24/25 box office figures, for a dead company they will be extremely good",2024-09-11
