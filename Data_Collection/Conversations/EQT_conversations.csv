"@Long Player I understand what you're saying. EQT may do very well soon and there is a lot of hope and reliance on the ""Rice Brothers"". But it's just not for me. ETRN was growth and income, but I didn't care for the deal or the 1.7% yield and loss of 2.3rds of the income, but as you said, it's about growth and not income. Time will tell if I made a good decision or not.",2024-10-08 11:52:27.336176
"@upnorthwi The reason that EQT could do well is because they believe that the latest acquisition will drop costs 25%.  So the breakeven point for natural gas will go below $2 (significantly below).  Furthermore, with each acquisition they also made sure to get midstream assets (with connections) because AR was getting much better money for its gas while  EQT was stuck in an oversupplied basin.  Now with the latest acquisition, that process should be near completion.  EQT will be giving AR a run for its money (so to speak).The Rice Brothers have done well at previous attempts at building and selling companies.  This one looks to be on track as well.  But it is a growth story and not really an income story.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@Rhoda711 I was still ticked off with loss of income and sold for NXG. Going back to 9/1/24 they're both pretty much even in performance, but NXG is a 14.6% monthly vs 1.7% quarterly. Yes, EQT may become a star, but for me, I'm happy.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000

"Best management in this niche (the Rice Brothers)...  Long EQT for the long term (big position)...Natural gas prices are absurdly cheap right now---they will head  upward  longer term---inevitable, not just probable......",2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
Yes so undervalued and shorted a month ago and glad I loaded up,2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
@pscott3 Several months ago there was talk of Mexico building LNG plants that would be supplied by gas traveling from Permian. It could be that there are more plants coming on stream than most people expect. The recent Nat gas price rally could have legs.,2024-09-29 00:00:00.000000
"Excellent article Zoltan Ban. According to Morgan Stanley, EQT said to have $1.80-1.90 breakevens. Very low break evens and control over pipeline egress out of Marcellus via MVP. Additionally the fact that MSFT and PA government backing restart of 3mi Island pinpoints the extreme energy shortage thatâ€™s looming with AI Datacenters. NatGas will be needed for these Datacenters as it is immediately available, cheap, safe and reliable.www.msn.com/...news.yahoo.com/...",2024-09-28 00:00:00.000000
@daviry2367 there are 2 more (currently) 7) LNG terminals that will begin operating before year end; could it be in anticipation of them as well as the price?,2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
"Price finally inches slightly above where it was two decades ago and this guy immediately rolls back  rationalization which industry-wide will be much less than 2% even though storage is stuffed to the gills. There is little hope for profitability in this industry. We need outsiders brought into the business because incumbents simply don't have the experience to run profitable companies. All they know how to do is over produce and tank the price. This should be so easy, demand is constantly upward every year and these guys always slay the golden goose. Here we go again. We are one year away of any incremental LNG and this guy is cranking up production now? Whack-a-doodle.",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"I added to my EQT shares in the low 30s, which is a bargain in my opinion. Morgan Stanley just upgraded them last week to a topic and $45 price target with a new pipeline they stated their cost for natural gas is under two dollars. So a lot of money to be made ahead. Good luck to all investors.",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
Prices are so high now that they see huge opportunities to profit again. Smart guys!,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"@User 21106 I  feel NG is an undervalued sector . Once demands increases and more LNG is exported, we will see four plus again. I believe MPV line will help EQT and we should see some stronger capital next year. im heavy in ET/EPD/EQT/AM and all pipelines. We need them.",2024-09-23 00:00:00.000000
@User 21106 It could be the jump in NG prices. We are up to 2.83 today.,2024-09-23 00:00:00.000000
I wanted to get out of my position in this (because I have too much exposure to natural gas) but the darn thing keeps going up the last three trading days - strong today.  I don't see news which justifies that.,2024-09-23 00:00:00.000000
@qwerty11 don't complain buy more. I want nat gas sentiment to be as Bearish as possible to accumulate as many shares as possible for each dollar of capital,2024-09-20 00:00:00.000000
@qwerty11 True. Empire building can justify a bigger salary. Same with the acquisition game.,2024-09-19 00:00:00.000000
Thanks Mr. Rice for pressurizing the NG price for the near term. Your salary and bonuses won't suffer from it.,2024-09-19 00:00:00.000000
