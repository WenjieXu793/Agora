We really need Chinse solar panels but we place tariffs on as if we are trying to protect our domestic solar panel industry that is almost nonexistent. First Solar is the only large name worthy mentioning but it is small . We dont really want solar farms anyway. We want rooftops to help cover our crazy utility bills in California especialy.We are still avodiing telurium mines ..it is obvious!!  We dont want tellurium.,2024-10-08 11:32:35.992156
FSLR has own politics for themselves..  They are not friendly to shareholders.. This is something to keep in mind!    I am very concerned about future tellurium supplies.. We should know or hear about new additional supplies by now but so far nothing except that token one from Rio Tinto for about 20 tons. ayear.The most recent stats on world production of tellurium was in 2022. nothing for 2023 and 2024.. Looks like the same  .There is a tiny exploration company focused on tellurium depoists in this continent  and they are struggling as if politics has much to do with it... from FSLR themselves?>?,2024-10-08 11:32:35.992156
"I have searched for the latest data on currrent tellurium production and the most current as from 2022.  That year, FSLR was not producing more than 5 GW or 10.. Now FSLR has doubled manufacturing in just two years already.It is well known that tellurium is a byproduct of copper they are nascent in quantities with lousy yields . Probably China has increased tellurium since 2022 and probably remains silent in light of recent anxiety over Taiwan and new sanctions against China on many products.I find it rather curious that China remains to supply tellurium regardlessly. Mabye our govenment is careful about crossing certain lines that might trigger stoppage of tellurium sales to FSLR. All the more imporatnt reason we have to start developing our own ""primary"" tellurium mines here in North America. There is only one exploration company that focus solely on tellurium although one of their depoists are actually a porphory kind that also contains copper, moly , gold and silver as well as tellurium which is exceptionallly high in grade as about 5 ounces per ton which is unusual. But the other deposit is pure primary tellurium deposit that is way higher in grade ore  more like over 50 pounds per ton or even 90 pounds . That company chose the porphory one as the first one to explore which I find it unusual. They also develop a tellurium thermoelectric device that can run on propane  to generate electricity  that will be manufactured soon as a way to draw down the ""mysterious"" inventories of tellurium outside here and force FSLR to buy that company out to shut down that frivilioous thermoelectric device.More to the point, I ask why everyone is keeping their distance from anything to do with tellurium supplies as if they hope that FSLR will stumble on sudden shortages of telllurium one day before they swoop in cheaper FSLR shares.I find that all silly !",2024-10-08 11:32:35.992156
"@ESP equity research Besides solar panels,  eveyrone is starting to look at mini nukes and gensets instead ... This will screw up everything!",2024-10-08 11:32:35.992156
"@ESP equity research They will charge you princely for disposal of your Chinese solar panels.. it wont be cheap.you will have to pay for it to be recycled which is ironically much higher than FSLR 's kind. FSLR include free recycling on all customer's contracts.. All of them!! Tellurium is rare so it must be recycled and it is not as hard as silicon crystalline which will be manytimes higher. Still, we will charge you for ""recycling"" and  dispose of it at landifills anyway.too expensive to recycle silicon crsytalline . which is ironic",2024-10-08 11:32:35.992156
"@ESP equity research i dont really care about most things with ONE EXCEPTION...   future tellurium supplies for FSLR.  At the rate , FSLR has been expanding, I figure FSLR has already used up the world production . Everyone is now scraping  off the bottom of the barrel now. Some may be stockpiling and we are probably mistaken for thinking that tellurium supply is a non issue.. Even if it is an non issue, I still question future FSLR expansioin in the long term. If you think 25 GW is all we need  and call it as a niche as such. you are probably mistaken.FSLR is the only manufacturer of totally recyclable solar panels.  Nothing from China or Texas!!We will have a colossal land fill headache in the future.",2024-10-08 11:32:35.992156
"@Turre Not sure about $400, but a Harris win would be a great tailwind for FSLR. We really need new capacity on the grid, and load growth has just begun...ESP",2024-10-08 11:32:35.992156
"@Quality Dividend Growth Nice balanced article. I have written bullish articles on FSLR in the past. Still like the company, just fell the share price got a bit too high. But now that it has moved back down in price i may have FSLR as a buy again.I am concerned about the POTUS thing - tRump could be a risk to the subsidies FSLR will get for 4 years. But as a long-term investor, you can look past 4 years.Still like JKS and CSIQ better based on valuation and global footprint. CSIQ also has a more diverse BIZ model. All 3 could prosper - the world needs a lot more electric capacity so we can have many winners in the solar space...Good luck with FSLRESP",2024-10-08 11:32:35.992156
Agree that no matter what it will take until 2026 to feel the potential effect of an IRA cancellation on the company results. If Harris wins this stock will catapult to $400-$500 in 2025 when the monster EPS is realised.,2024-10-08 11:32:35.992156
"@OilIsDEAD Yes cheaper if made anywhere. All solar production is really automated - both Si and CdTe - so it can be made anywhere...CSIQ will be producing a lot of modules right here in Texas and at a much lower cost than FSLR...Also, stop the racism again folks from Asia - it is repugnant...You and the FSLR CEO need to make positive themes for FSLR - not just the MAGA hate crap...ESP",2024-10-08 11:32:35.992156
@ESP equity research yes if made in China but here ? no ..   FSLR isthe cheapest .with free recycling thrown inwill we have enough tellurium? This is what stopped FSLR currently.Tehre is an exploration company with two deposits here and they are not getting much help at all.Generac is flushing all renewables down.,2024-10-08 11:32:35.992156
@OilIsDEAD No I will not go away. You need a life and a chill pill...We feel Si-based solar is the most long-term cost-effective solar. FSLR can be a niche player,2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@ESP equity research First Solar makes the ONLY RECYCLABLE SOLAR PANEL in the whole world!! NOthing from China is recyclable ! Chinese panels are so cheap that it is cheaper to throw away in someone's local landfills. Even more, First solar include recyclable pick up as included in all purchase orders with customers. Frist Solar is the lowest carbon input in manufacturing solar panels . One source manufacturing ,no trucking between plants to complete panelsToxic?   I think you ought to make yourself more useful writing about toxic happenings in the oil industry .. than First Soalr panels.you are exaggerating red herrings!!",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
@ESP equity research you also know better than to ignore the questionalbe future supply of tellurium for First Solar!! you must be counting on your short sales on FSLR making you money while FSLR suddenl run into tellurium shortages.you are messin' with FSLR shareholders and I am having none fo that!Go away1,2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
First Solar can no longer keep silent on future tellurium supplies because First Solar is already consuming all the world's tellurium production..  Fist Solar is running down the warehouses for tellurium.  Soon will run out of it.Tehre is a tiny tellurium exploration company the only one in the world !!!  Silence is costing Frist Solar in stock value... First Solar is expected to come up with the answer to the all iimportant question!! Answer  now!!!!,2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"First Solar will probably make good on their questionable and opaque tellurium supply future once the tariffs are place in effect.. The question is when.When done, then you probably will hear more from First Solar on future tellurium supplies..  They may buy out the tiny tellurium exploration company for a billion dollars. First Solar is already risking their necks out with current expansion of manufcturing to 25 GW , yet 25 GW is not going to be enough .. it is more like 100 or 200 GW .   One GW solar farm save about 588 barrels of fossil fuel a hour or 3000 barrels a day. Many oil dipsticks will howl if more solar farms are built..  Are we ready for them?",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"FSLR should buy back their tellurium deposits from that tiny exploration company that is run by a former FSLR geologist, anyway!  FSLR sold the deposits to the geologist back in 2012 because FSLR was in retreat from the onslaught of Chinese polysilicon dumping herre .  FSLR got out of solar farm development division , too and focused on manufacturing alone ever since. you can find many articles about future tellurium supplies as questionable for First Solar but those articles are rather dated.. So far, only one article covers a large copper miner that invest $3 million to produce tellurium as byproduct of copper which will be about 20 tons annually which is a drop in the bucket .Maybe there are already otehr copper miners joining  to do similar things but I hear nothing about that .First Solar will continue to be a small competitor against other legal Chinese producers here in America..  Sunpower went under. Maxeon will go under.Locals are still against solar farms.. and this is a policy risk ,too.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"I doubt First Solar is the cheapest now because of policy risks that wont be cleared at least past Apricl 2025 when all the tariffs on illegal oversea solar panels are presumably finalized and put in effect.  Government needs to give the hard luck rooftop solar guys time to get out of the way.I see FSLR alnguishing down to 150 or lower by April 2025 before I know what will transpire..  If the tariffs are put in place then and FirstSolar starts feeling more confident about resuming expansion of manufacturing capacity beyond 25GW..  Even so, will there continue to be a largge backlog that First Solar had been enjoying in proportion to growing manufacturing capacity with one more new plant under construction yet to be completed next year.Recently   FSLR opened a new plant in Alabama or Missisissipiiadding 3GW.Still the locals are active against more solar farms as they prefer to use gensets instead of solar farms ..This is a big problme!",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"@OilIsDEAD Could be, but I do not think so. FSLR is large-scale Utility solar - so it's run by very conservative utility politics - which are more Republican...Almost all other solar PV is Si-based - and these panels are more efficient and cheaper to make, and can be sited anywhere - large Ute, muni level, rooftop, irrigation, farms, etc...Since FSLR uses Cadmium - a toxic substance it has limited use cases - large Ute scale farms...The investor plays here in CSIQ and JKS modules IMHO. JKS more a pure module and China play, and CSIQ more diversified global player. Both trade a large discounts to thier intrinsic value...",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"Policy risks?   Probably not.... I suspect First Solar is managed by mostly Repubicans so the adminstration is not really as enthuisastic about hleping First Solar Republicans, right? This is probably another reason FSLR has been strangely silent on future tellurium supplies. It look like FSLR will have to wait till April when all the tariffs on dumped panels from the Southeast Asia is finalized and put in effect, just to make sure that the ink is dry first.. before they move on tellurium.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
