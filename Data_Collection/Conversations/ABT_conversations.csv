There won't be any long term ROI for this product because the WHO doesn't have TESTING CREDIBILITY anymore after the last few years :-(,2024-10-04
"I dont know about you folks but Im going to take these dividends that apparently ""dont matter"" or somehow ""arent real returns"" and pay for  dinner or buy other stocks with them. ;-) GLTA",2024-09-20
"@Buyandhold 2012 I bought and have held a modest amount of ABT since the early 1950s. Though the results have not be as amazing as those of Grace Gronier, still they are astonishing.Currently the ABBV kicker is my top investment portfolio stock, with ABT second.",2024-09-19
"@Leo Nelissen  Abbott is a wonderful company as is ABBV.  I worked for Abbott for almost 10 years through the 90's and receive a small pension from them.  Unfortunately, our department was sold off to a division of Sumitomo where I stayed another 17 years in sales where I retired before starting another career.  I can tell you that Abbott is first class in every single regard.  I would definitely be in ABT if it paid a better dividend.  It is very unfortunate that I sold my shares after I left.  But, I am quite long ABBV and very happy with that.",2024-09-16
"@ndardick I'll be watching the Steelers game with one eye and use the other eye to watch the Chiefs game. Btw, MDT is a great pick as well. They are in a great spot to win big in the Medtech business. Have a great weekend!",2024-09-14
@ocbearclaw The only reason I do not own ABT is because of my investment in DHR.,2024-09-14
@Buyandhold 2012 You have been with ABT for 54 years? Impressive!! Have a great weekend!,2024-09-14
@Sitnikov Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad to hear you have been with the stock for roughly 13 years!,2024-09-14
"@User 28897925 Numbers are funny things.Bought ABT monthly from '97 to '00, reinvesting dividends.  As those purchase costs were divvied up at split time, was actually purchasing ABBV as well.Since the split, as all dividends are reinvested, the cost basis for ABBV has gone up at a faster rate (higher dividend) than has ABT.  The % return over the entire period is a dead heat (282% vs. 283%).  Understand you are talking a/b share price, just looking at it another way.  Bottom line it was a great split.  Thanks again @Leo Nelissen Alex.",2024-09-13
Is it possible to outperform the market without multiple expansion having growth only 10% (=market return).,2024-09-13
"@Txsboy Over the years, I have bought more shares of $ABT whenever I thought it looked cheap.",2024-09-13
@Buyandhold 2012 do you or have you ever reinvested right back into the company?  Most people I personally know automatically reinvest their shares but I’m reading on here more and more people don’t automatically do that. I’d love to hear your thoughts given your experience and success,2024-09-13
"Thanks for another fine article (and once again about a company i happen to own and like :)  i have owned ABT since 2011...i recently trimmed my position though because a) even if facts in the formula cases are on ABT's side, i think the litigation risk might weigh on the stock for years, and i frankly do not understand why some analysts have been so dismissive of the risk, even after the last verdict: i've yet to hear a good explanation of why they think the risk is is low, and b) there are some stocks i find more attractive now that i want to increase my positions in (e.g. ZTS, CMI)...it's still a major (9%) position in my very concentrated stock portfolio, but honestly, i might trim again if there was another spike in price...on a more positive note, one of the main reasons i like ABT long term is because of emerging markets exposure, both in terms of growth and as a way to benefit from a falling USD...",2024-09-13
"I've been an $ABT shareholder for 54 years.On January 2, 2013, I received one share of $ABBV for each of my shares of $ABT.In addition, $ABT spun off Hospira which was purchased by another company(I think it was Pfizer) for $90 a share.Grace Groner invested $180 in $ABT in 1934.  Now those shares are worth 50 million dollars.So the thing to do with $ABT is to buy it and then never sell it.Buying it when it's cheap would, of course, be better.Since confession is good for the soul, I drink Boost which is made by Nestles instead of Ensure which is made by Abbott.  But don't tell anyone.",2024-09-13
"Compare prices of ABT and ABBV over 5 years: ABT up 38%, ABBV up 176%. Compare divs: ABT=1.89%, ABBV=3.2%. Fortunately we own both.",2024-09-13
ABT is a great company that has been overvalued for years… when it drops below 100 I’ll grab a couple shares BUT fundamentally I’m thinking it’s worth about $85 a share… sadly the market is pricey.,2024-09-13
"I recently decided (for about the 9th or 10th time in the past year) not to buy ABT unless its price is closer to $100. I like the medical devices they make, but I have concerns about their pharma, diagnostic and nutritional products. My 3 granddaughters chose MDT instead of ABT a few years ago to take advantage of increasing sales of medical devices. And I'm sticking with my recently accumulated full positions in PFE and BMY, as we have discussed, to take advantage of their higher dividends and oncology pipelines that seem more impressive to me.To be clear, ABT is always high on my Watch List, but doesn't ever make the cut to get included in our portfolios.Have a great weekend, Leo, and enjoy a football game or two. I will be watching Northwestern football tomorrow night, and the Chicago Bears on Sunday evening. Because of their broadcast times, you will likely sleep through both!",2024-09-13
"@Tambo210 The sensors do not sample the blood, they use ""enzymatic technology that reacts with glucose molecules in the interstitial fluid to generate an electric current proportional to the glucose concentration.Here is what Abbot says about attaching the sensors;""the majority of Abbott CGM users said that applying a biosensor was painless. In a study conducted by Abbott, 91.6 % of users surveyed (n=119) agree that it was painless to apply the biosensor.""",2024-09-09
