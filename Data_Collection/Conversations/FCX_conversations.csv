@Swamp Thing So what is interesting here is that China imports about 1/2 of the worlds copper but they also refine a little over 1/2 of the worlds copper. So the net supply of raw finished copper would actually decrease slightly I believe for the rest of the world if they went to war and cut off the world from their exports,2024-10-02
"TECK appears to be a better pure play on copper, because it does not have the Indonesian issue. I remember a few years ago when FCX share price took a huge hit due to problems negotiating with the government in Indonesia.",2024-09-29
"60,000,000 million vehicles produced per Year by China is the new goal? Already at 30,000,000 million is my understanding. And how does Tesla no longer doing solar roof anymore help with this? *""Not at all and that's the point!""?* Did China pay for the hit on Trump is that who is behind all this? Sure doubt it was Boeing is an understatement.",2024-09-26
"@D.J.Reef yep.  I start with $1000 and always hope it goes down more so I can add more, each time another $1000...",2024-09-26
"@Stock Scanner I try to buy below the SP500 P/E, which is about 27 now, I think. Do i make sense?",2024-09-26
"May be too much optimism here. FCX, for instance, is now at 30x EPS!",2024-09-26
Am adding to FCX position as price rises. I call it a Boone Pickens move.,2024-09-19
"@wordsmith1960  I had some RIO, which like BHP is big in iron ore. But with iron ore  prices down I sold all shares. I feel either or both BHP or RIO is likely to make a substantial copper producer offer. It could be anyone, but TECK looks cheap at around $25 billion market cap. In a buyout, usually the buyer’s share price goes down, and another reason for not owning RIO.Long FCX and TECK.",2024-09-19
@Stone Fox Capital  I did read the BHP news report and I agree that this is likely a good time to get into the copper miners. Long FCX and…..TECK as a possible takeover stock.,2024-09-19
"Copper looks ready for another run. -The growth of artificial intelligence will exacerbate a looming shortage of copper, BHP (BHP) CFO Vandita Pant warned in an interview this week with the Financial Times.-The rise of data centers and AI could boost global copper demand by 3.4M metric tons/year by 2050, the CFO said, when demand should hit 52.5M tons/year, up 72% from 2021.-""Today, data centers are less than 1% of copper demand, but that is expected to be 6%-7% by 2050,"" Pant told FT.",2024-09-19
