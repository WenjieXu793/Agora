"@Doggywag Don't sleep on the LMT buybacks, they have been very effective and a big reason why the stock has done so well.  At the end of 2020, the share count was 281M shares.  3 years later it was 251M at the end of 2023.  10% of shares retired in 3 years is a lot and should allow for higher dividend raises going forward.",2024-10-06
"I believe LMT is the best defense stock among GD, NOC, RTX and HII.  I hope LMT can solve the F35 radar problem and move on.  I was wondering about astock split as well.  Companies don't give splits much anymore.  Strange.",2024-10-06
@MySami it will be greatly reduced if Pooh decides to invade Taiwan. I think Putins disaster in Ukraine is giving him second thoughts.,2024-10-05
Bought most of it in 2011and regard it as a never sell.,2024-10-05
@123semi It's not in Putin's interest for him to unilaterally pull out of the Ukraine at this time..The West will have to offer Putin a plausible off ramp dealthat will allow Putin a reason to quit fighting.Putin has control of approx 20% of the Ukraine land mass.Most of it he has controlled since 2014.  Perhaps the best time to have seriously negotiated with Putin would have been 8 years ago...? As it stands now its absolutely fantasy to think Putin willexit the whole of Ukraine without Zelensky giving up someterritory to get a deal done.,2024-10-05

"@MySami really. Russia is already facing massive labor shortages amd inflation because of the lack of working age men. Drafted, fled the country or dead. You need to study Russian demographics. They are in big trouble.",2024-10-04
"I have owned $LMT for getting close to 12 years now, and it is my largest holding as it is a never sell stock.  Sure, there are times the PE gets ahead of itself, but in the end the stock continues to rise and the dividends continue well above the rate of inflation.Right now, though, this long-term chart shows a parabolic pattern which is a warning sign.bigcharts.marketwatch.com/...  I think the time is near for some protective puts in this never sell stock.",2024-10-04
"Be nice to see them split the stock about 5-1.  Although the dividend is not what it's been in years past, at least it beats the headline rate of inflation.Not complaining since the dividends now have more than paid for my Feb 2013 investment, with the price appreciation being the gravy.",2024-10-04
@2patbeth Reduce the Chinese population. Will be good for the planet,2024-10-04
Latest dividend increase is less than 5%. That is not cool.,2024-10-04
"@TrustTheMF I agree with you.  However, it still begs the question as to at what price is LMT stock overvalued?",2024-10-04
"I would have liked a little more dividend increase and a little less buyback.  Still, I'm in this one for life.",2024-10-04
@user 305102 All of these stocks are still relatively cheap compared to expected growth. LMT and NOC are also Buys but with a lower margin of error.,2024-10-04
"@Ray Merola- certainly Investor sentiment would be lessened should the threat of war recede. But the US militaryinventory (and other customer of military equipment and munitions) has been significantly depleted by supporting Ukraine & Israel such that the defense contracts will see increased revenues for the next several years to rebuild the US arsenal. Further, Chinese aggressiveness will further increase the need for new and/or enhanced military technology and systems to maintain US military superiority and deterence credibility.",2024-10-04
Have held before Martin Marietta merger in 1995 but not for the dividend,2024-10-04
"Total returns have been great since  Martin Marietta merger in 1995, not something you buy just for the dividend",2024-10-04
"@joeycool Why think this? Because it is so. It's in line with their last raise? Yes, but less in absolute amount than in prior years and less than last raise, percentage wise.If unhappy, why not sell? Right now, it's the tax trap and lack of much better alternatives. But in time, a sale will happen.",2024-10-03
"""And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be frightened; those things must take place; but that is not yet the end. For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; the will be earthquakes in various places; there will also be famines. These things are merely the beginning of birth pangs.""

"@Ray Merola Let's assume Israel were to attack Iran's oil. LMT would likely jump 10%. If that were to happen, I would have to switch to a Hold rating. That's how I see it. Maybe I'm wrong.",2024-10-03
