"I am not a REIT fan, but took a small position this year.. Believe the metrics are in the share holders favor. Appreciate your detailed analysis.  And commentary.Risks analysis is solid.Would like monthly Dividends.",2024-10-08 11:04:50.942916
@Mo_Hawk Da hast du recht. Trotz Steuer möchte ich solch hochqualitative Investmentmöglichkeiten nicht missen. :-),2024-10-08 11:04:50.942916
Good morning from germany.I like your analysis of VICI. I have a full position in the REIT and am happy to own it.,2024-10-08 11:04:50.942916
EPR would make a nice add on. Accrevite & 1/10th mkt value of VICI.,2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@Sam_12 Congrats, the market has finally realized its folly of undervaluing the top REITs!",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
@Cash472 Sorry that basis is for a different stock.   I wise it was for VICI but no.,2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
I've owned VICI for a couple of years now with a basis of $7-  I'm just holding what I have and watching the dividends coming into my account.   This was a nice write-up.   My name is Cash472 and I approve this message.,2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
VICI has been range bound since 2021 bouncing from high twenties to low thirties. Is this where VICI breaks out?,2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
"I own VICI in my traditional IRA.  I own it for stability and income.  I believe there is further upside ahead, but I'm not expecting a lot of growth in the short term.  I also own O, WPC, REXR and CTO.  CTO is my most speculative of my REIT holdings.  Interestingly, I am up 10-20% this year on all of the foregoing REITS except REXR, and I'm only slightly up there.  Still, I believe it should recover substantially in 2025.  Thanks for your article.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
"@LearningAllWays Yes, they went bankrupt in Atlantic City cause Trumps a terrible business man.Since Las Vegas was founded I don't know of a casinos that had trouble there to the extent of bankruptcy. It's an international destination. You probably know this, but VICI collected 100% rent during Covid. That bodes pretty well.",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@kmetviner The majority of VICI's leases are ""master leases"" with large operators. So the lease encompasses multiple properties with cross-defaults. As a result, if a particular property becomes unprofitable and the operator no longer wants it, it is the tenant's obligation to find a new operator to take over the lease, otherwise, the rent is reapportioned to other properties within the portfolio whether the property is open or not. So the risk that VICI is taking often isn't property dependent aside from a few of their leases that are one operator that owns one property, presumably if the property goes under the operator does too. The risk VICI is taking is that the operators will remain solvent because ultimately the operators are responsible for rent regardless of what they decide to do with the properties. Which for VICI, the biggest risk exposure is to CZR and MGM, combined for 80% of the portfolio and either one would be a really big deal for VICI if they went under. Their largest single property risk VICI has is the Venetian (9% of gross rent).",2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
@LearningAllWays Completely in agreement here. Atlantic City is a great example and it's supporting my previous statement. I still like $OHI better than $O but it's also a fine choice.,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"@brotherbear Casino's have gone bankrupt, see Atlantic City.  My fear of VICI is that when times are good they get their rent, when it goes bad they are stuck with an casino albatross that has little salvageable value,  ""heads, I win, tails you lose"" - so to speak.  Even though I'm heavily in REITS, I think I'd rather own the operators in this case.I can accept O's foray into Encore since it's a very small portion holding in a thriving commercial belt that can absorb a hotel and function facility.",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
@stompers54 agreed ! Would rather have larger dividends then equity raise to expand in areas that are not core to gambling which is their expertise!,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
@Rida Morwa - i see Vici as a low risk way to earn a growing 5% dividend in a growth industry..getting paid for Americas vices just like Tobacco,2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"@kmetviner Quite often with specialized properties, the operator changes but the landlord keeps on collecting rent. This is the same situation with most movie theaters as well.",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"@kmetviner While there have been bankruptcies in Casino operators, most of them result in a new operator and continued operation of the space as a casino. Trump Taj Majal went bankrupt but operates today as the Hard Rock. Resorts International is the Ocean Casino Resort. The Dunes in Las Vegas couldn’t compete with Bellagio, MGM Grand, and Mandalay Bay but was demolished and is now the Venetian.The value of these properties to operators is such that the last thing they’d fail to pay is rent. VICI collected 100% of rent through COVID closures ($0 tenant income) and in the two years after it took for casino revenues to reach pre-COVID levels.Everyone needs to be comfortable with their investments so I’m not saying you should. But I am saying that I see VICI as in the top quartile of my own investments when it comes to safety. It’s a boring utility.",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"@kmetviner I agree with your skepticism of casinos.  As Rida states “ I would rather own the house and collect revenue from people who indulge in the activity than do the gambling myself.”.. I choose RIET as a way to well managed REIT investments with a good monthly pay.  They own VICI, EPR, and GLPI as I sleep better.  I’ve held O a long time with good results, but others I picked were disappointing, sold, and invested in RIET. Best, Rog ",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"Owning $VICI is not the same owning the house, while it is a nice play on words, the house always wins because they make sure the odds are always in their favor and they use that to make much more than 5% annually, they would be bankrupt if they didn't. The resort business is much higher risk and much higher reward economy. You are NOT investing in that.Thus, this ticker should be looked at as what it is, a relatively steady 5% income that is far from being immune from economy downturn. The glamour surroundings Vegas and gambling history (if indeed glamorous) should be almost completely ignored, aside from the fact that people in general like to gamble.I hold small position in $VICI, since I'm not retired yet there are much better risk/reward tickers out there, also most banks will give you 5% annual return if you have good standing with them.Bottom line, I'm not against $VICI, I hold a position myself but I feel pulling people in due to ""be a casino owner"" is a bit misleading, people should consider other REITS such as $OHI which I personally prefer as people may like gambling more than they like being in hospitals, but they spend more time in hospitals than in Vegas casinos.",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"Based on the widespread expansion of  gambling, both online and in terms of venues, there will come a time when some properties will become uneconomic and will not be able to pay rent to the landlord. I see that happening in Atlantic City, where one or more casinos seem to be doing poorly, even in the busy summer months. VICI may be able to weather the storm, but in the end they may have to reckon with empty buildings that have lost much of their value. So, while VICI has been doing very well, I prefer to buy other REITs.",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
