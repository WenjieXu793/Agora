"@Mike-SC After reviewing the article is seems the dems did it to please environmentalists and tribes that argue removing the dams is crucial for salmon recovery. I do not believe they considered the repercussions well enough.Dems will tend to have a strong voice when it comes to environmental  issues, but in my experience they fail to offer a better alternative for most situations. I have never met anyone who thought ""We should just trash the world and do whatever we can to hurt the environment"" - Republican or Democrat. The difference typically lies in the way information is presented to followers & media. I simply want the truth. For this case, opinions on whether dam removal will guarantee fish recovery are divided. Meaning they don't know if it will even work. But the downside includes negative impacts on irrigation, power supply, and transportation, costing taxpayers billions. I think the answer should be clear in this situation LOL.",2024-08-28
Thanks for the article Brad and Kody. I have owned IDA for over 20 years.  It was a good stock the first 15 years...not so much the last 5 years.  I rate them a hold/sell and I am going to trim back this year.They are not in a regulatory-friendly environment.  Look at Warren Buffettâ€™s latest annual letter to get his opinion on operating utilities in that area.,2024-08-28
