@Jeremy LaKosh I keep watching for insider buying or a new 13g but nothing. Seems crazy cheap here but I don’t like buying into charts like this,2024-09-21
"@ESP equity research Agree better rates in 2025 - but like I said, they are being conservative, refinancing early - even if it costs them a higher rate....",2024-09-18
"@bondsmoker Yes, but rates are moving down fast - they could have got a lower rate today? Or do the just know they can refi in 2025 at even lower rates?",2024-09-18
"@ESP equity research AMCX seems to have become uber-conservative with their debt - refinancing earlier than need be.  Comes at a cost, but beats running things to the last minute.",2024-09-18
@ESP equity research I'm a buyer at these levels.  The move out of the S&P 600 also created a dip that the company has bounced back from.  The $7.50 cash secured puts remain my favorite.,2024-09-18
@Jeremy LaKosh What is your take on the common at sub $10 prices? I just bought a starter position and will look at the debt as well. Seems like the latest conv bond issue really spooked investors - was this offering really needed?AMCX could buy back debt going forward if thier free cash flows are sufficient. 70%+ discount is enticing...ESP,2024-09-18
@bondsmoker Ouch.  I am taking another look at the $7.50s tomorrow.  Covered calls will hopefully be good to you.,2024-09-09
"@Jeremy LaKosh Gotcha - thanks.Man, beat-down hurts.  I had sold $10 puts expiring this month....",2024-09-09
