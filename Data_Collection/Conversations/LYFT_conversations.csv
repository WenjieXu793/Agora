"@The ROE Rocketeer Will have to wait for UBER to get a bit cheaper after its runup.  The best UBER Put that met my metrics was;3/21/2025 $70 for $4.85. The assign price would be $65.16 and it earns 15.1% (annualized) on the $6,516 of cash it ties up.",2024-09-23

"@fhbecker at least do it on a market leader. Uber remains cheap on FCF and PEG basis.Congrat on your early retirement. Hopefully, I’ll join the boat soon enough haha!",2024-09-22
"@fhbecker Long-dated options pose significant challenges for traditional pricing models, which often assume constant volatility. This assumption fails to account for the implied volatility skew and term structure, leading to mispricing. Additionally, factors like market volatility and industry disruption can quickly alter an investment thesis. For instance, in a competitive, tech-sensitive industry like Lyft's, unexpected shifts can rapidly drive up option prices, potentially doubling or tripling in a short span due to how options are priced under volatile conditions and thus making your exit very very expensive. Best of luck",2024-09-22
Best way to play LYFT is selling long dated PUTS.,2024-09-22
"When I started investing at 19, about four years ago, the most important lesson I learned was that returns often come down to being in the right place at the right time. Early on, I was obsessed with finding undervalued opportunities, but over time I realized one key truth: in the internet era, the aggregate returns from value investing have drastically diminished. More often than not, you end up in a value trap rather than finding a genuinely undervalued business.If there's a real catalyst, I believe there will be plenty of time to enter the stock, especially given how Lyft at current levels  —and I agree with that. I'm currently long on only two stocks: Uber, with 3,500 shares, and AVGO, which is my largest holding at 2,500 shares. It's tough to fit Lyft into my portfolio, haha.",2024-09-22
"what about the impact of self driving taxis like one from waymo, Tesla on Lyft stock?",2024-09-21
@Colorado Oilman Uber /  Lyft is a duopoly. Lots of AV companies. Uber / Lyft control the customer and have experience in managing car fleet.  Belive that AV will benefit Uber and Lyft.,2024-09-11
