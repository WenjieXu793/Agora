"@123semi Embarassing are economically illiterate politicians like Harris and Walz (heck, the entire dem party)",2024-09-30
"“Americans spend an average of nearly $10 per week on snacks, or more than $28K over a lifetime”That’s a short life time at $10 a week!  Or maybe the lifetime is shorter BECAUSE they’re spending $10 a week on extra snacks.",2024-09-29

@ComputerBlue just like Trump telling the oil industry to “drill baby drill”?!?! Or maybe not that embarrassing??,2024-09-29
I haven't bought any of that junk in years. It's poison.,2024-09-29
"For a medium/long term investor, HSY is worth accumulating at this price level.",2024-09-29
@cegibbs No he is suggesting that higher cocoa prices (due to reduced supply of cacao) will result in higher prices that lead to lower demand for chocolate. Commodity have almost tripled in the last year.,2024-09-27
I've been buying shares at $190 or lower with a holding period of forever.,2024-09-26
"Doesn’t lower demand usually result in lower prices, everything else being equal.  The author suggests lower demand will create higher prices.",2024-09-26
"@trentbridge Labels list ingredients based on usage in the formula. Cocoa prices have exploded and are not coming down. Despite using more sugar, their raw material costs are dominated by cocoa. And they have to use cocoa if they label it as ""chocolate"". So the article is correct that they have serious raw material headwinds, which is fine if they can pass these costs along to consumers, but that is increasingly becoming difficult.",2024-09-26
"Hershey is reaping what they sowed. Short-term, this doesn't look good.",2024-09-26
"@correct way to invest it's not that I disagree, I am just interested go learn what's your reason?",2024-09-26
@correct way to invest what do you mean it's always a buy? Because it's a staples / defensive food stock or why?,2024-09-26
@trentbridge WHAT DOES that have to do with whether the stock is a buy at these levels. My avg cost is 75 ...its always a buy,2024-09-26
"Hershey claims to sell chocolate but if you look at the ingredients - the largest ingredient is sugar.  Hershey sells chocolate-flavored sugar. From their website: Milk Chocolate (Sugar, Milk, Chocolate, Cocoa Butter, Milk Fat, Lecithin, PGPR, Natural Flavor)",2024-09-26
"What in the world? HSY has underperformed and growth is sluggish, margins falling. You offer no explanation for why HSY is all of a sudden going to start to outperform. One would be far better off buying an index fund.",2024-09-26
"One of my favorite plays right now. Have allocated 8% of my portfolio to it over the last several months. It’s been beaten down so bad but has formed a nice base and despite the dreadful earnings report last quarter, it didn’t sell off at all. To me, that indicates broad but hesitant investor confidence in a bounce back. I think there is a fair likelihood they don’t increase the dividend or increase by 1-2% this upcoming raise season but this will rip if/when they return to normalized EPS growth. This reminds me of IIPR when it was trading at $80/share. Once they had a few cautiously optimistic earnings reports, it ripped up by 70% for the next year.",2024-09-26
Have been watching this one for a while.  I added some in the $180s.  patiently waiting for it to go back to $180 or below at which time I would aggressively build this one up,2024-09-24
The author misses the main point . HSY is the company most tethered to cocoa prices and the small area of the world where cocoa is grown has been experiencing major problems (think W.Africa). That's why cocoa prices are high.,2024-09-23
@Luca Socci Maybe you could analyze Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon.  Thank you for your consideration.,2024-09-23
