"@sdavid04191 both stores in my area have low traffic. I am so so glad and Lucky we crushed our remodels just before the inflation hit, and loaded off the outrageous 30 percent tag last year. They get you on the small stuff, door insulation strips, hardware, all the usual maintenance items.",2024-09-25
As I've posted before I have had several big projects pent up since Covid and am finally getting around to them.  My preference has found that LOW is usually lower of the 2 on prices and their in store people are most helpful.  I'm currently framing a huge new shed on a poured concrete base.  Much to my surprise I scored pressure treated 2 x 4's at under $4 at HD.  During Covid these things were more than double in price.  The problem is in the HD I bought these in help was hard 2 find.  There was only 1 checkout opened and the guy in front of me only had a door and a lot of framing lumber of varying sizes.  The woman cashier scanned each one and then maticulously measured each one and compared it to what scanned.  2 people in the store and one of them had to wait more than a half hour to check out.  Since time is money my cheap 2 x 4's cost me a lot more.  This has happened in this store too many times which is why I prefer the LOW next door.,2024-09-24
"""The firm's thesis is that lower interest rates following the FOMC action last week could help boost the stock.""     In theory I should look at my statement and see interest at say 9 percent, not 30?!  Boys in white shirts and suits in ivory towers obviously don't shop for nails and 2x4's.",2024-09-24
Love our Lowe's. As I've penned for a couple of years I could buy Lowe's all day. Greatly overweigthted in one of my wife's accounts - along with Berkshire.,2024-09-24
"@LiftedLife $69? Great price! And yes, hard to add more money here from that perspective.",2024-09-20
@LiftedLife 15 year is at 5.74% today. I do agree that lower rates will get more houses sold and then LOW should benefit.,2024-09-20
"When mortgage rates hit sub 6%, that should spur more new and existing home sales which should lead to more decorating, remodeling etc. which should benefit LOW. I bought in at $69 so tough to add at these levels but LOW is a stock I've seen a lot of people retire healthy and wealthy with.",2024-09-20
As poorly as it has done over the last 12 months some how it is near a 52 week high. Valuation is high relative to 5 year average but lower rates will help.,2024-09-19
@bigfish1977 I know but a long time ago I researched LOW and HD.  It was when HD was having problems with Nardelli as CEO.  I picked LOW to start a position and I've added to it on dips.  HD eventually did get its act together.  Both are attractive.,2024-09-18
