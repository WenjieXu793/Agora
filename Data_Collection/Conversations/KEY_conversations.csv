"As a long term holder on this bank I'm about ready to take my gains and wait for what you determine is a mild 25% overall cost excess to fair valuation.And as an unfortunate holder of NYCB I will say this - I haven't read of one of their loans actually defaulting, although, thanks to the FEDs steering them into buying an additional bank that was in failure, they were required to raise their CET-1 ratio and taken together with the need to raise their loan reserves to cover POSSIBLE as opposed to ACTUAL loan losses they had to slash their dividends. But, they've been around since before the civil war, and no one who has bet against NYC real estate has ever won that bet - although their have been periods of digression. They'll soon have raised their reserves sufficiently to start raising the dividend. I think I've convinced myself to buy some more of that stock before its valuation starts to rise up.",2024-09-27
"The only lesson learned from 2008 is that bubbles need to be even bigger so yes easy to understand the push back against consolidation lest everyone jump aboard the whole *""Intel the entire US economy!""* craziness. Short $gs Goldman Sachs strong sell. *SOMETHING* needs to be done about New York City Community Bank. Force Goldman Sachs to buy that is my solution and *MAKE* GS become a Bank. The whole reason to create the mania in the first instance is to make a fortune in the ensuing bust. Banks don't do that $gs does that. Long $wec Wisconsin Energy strong buy. One way to solve the so called ""electricity crisis that can only be solved by nuclear power"" is to use a brand new coal fired solution not that Pennsylvania would ever try that of course. Long $mdu strong buy that one supports the local economy big time.",2024-09-26
"@lovegreen appreciate your commentary.  for our readers, how do you think Keycorp fares against its peers, or even larger-cap banks, when it comes to capturing the potential demand for mortgages if rates continue to fall?",2024-09-24

This administration is doing everything they can to prevent corporate mergers. One problem with this is how they going to get those higher taxes from corporations if they prevent them from making money.,2024-09-17

"Short the banks. With this new rule, and the rule for increased reserve requirements, in addition to the massive upside-down portfolios the banks hold in bonds and real estate, there is a major downside brewing up in the banking sector.",2024-09-17
"@2021investor Lower Mortgage rates will lead to refinancing at lower rates, devaluing mortgages via higher CPR, and leading to lower interest components. If you think service fees will salvage the lost value, then go ahead. The only thing going for banks in a declining-rate environment is 1) IBD, and 2) Lower funding cost + higher credit spread on loan book, but credit event risk is usually higher when rates first start dropping, so, that's why you're seeing banks reduce duration on loans (lower returns), I use $MS as an example.",2024-09-13

"@MileHighMoney30 It's both. ""The market"" is a lot of different people doing different things. Sometimes the things they do has a common theme. However, news articles talk about ""the market"" as if it's one individual. Trying to understand the psychology of ""the market"" is like trying to understand what direction an army of ants will scatter. Depending on the environment, incentives, and stimulus, it can be all sorts of things.Some people are expecting 25bps, others are expecting 50bps, some changed their minds given X or Y news. On balance, the net change is reflected in the market. Zoomed out, it looks ""random"" to a series of economists and other academics. When it finally happens next week, the immediate result will be corrected towards what actually happens. But the overall long-term result ""should"" be that the economy improves with rate cuts, depending on how severe the economy was damaged with the rate hikes.That's my take at least from a random guy on the internet.",2024-09-11
@MileHighMoney30 Rate cuts are good for banks looking to grow their loan books.,2024-09-11
"Im confused, I thought a larger rate cut meant the economy was struggling more than we would like but now a smaller rate cut is bad? Which is it?!",2024-09-11
This is the start of possibly a very dramatic easing cycle so hardly bad news for Banks as credit becomes more widely available and as there be no shortage of Government need to borrow let alone all of the massive industries currently running flat out to meet demand and still hardly immaterial inflation even Banks should make money here.

Banks were down previously because a 50 bsp cut was on the table. Letâ€™s pick whatever nonsense headline fits our narrative today. NII is the story this week with JPM cooling expectations. This has overshadowed banks who made positive remarks and reaffirmed guidance. Place your bets accordingly.,2024-09-11
"Why the rush? If they were patient, they may have gotten more after a couple of rate cuts. A couple is specified because an economic downturn, which would  cut prices, does not appear to be on the horizon through years end. So a bit of patience may have resulted in a better price.",2024-09-10
