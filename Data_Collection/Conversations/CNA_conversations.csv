"@kata en.wikipedia.org/...Ian in 2022 was the 3rd costliest hurricane ever. Everest, along with other reinsurance capital, like Axis, made a strategic pivot away from cat reinsurance following Ian, which was the straw that broke the camels back after a long period of underperformance in cat reinsurance, mainly stemming from ‘secondary perils’ such as flood, wildfire, hail etc.",2024-08-26
"@Far Horizon Of course they have scaled it back because there have been almost no hurricanes, nor the wind risk exposure mentioned above nor claims associated with it. Why that would reduce their capital I haven't a clue. Their capital comes from insurance payments minus claim payouts plus the investment income that comes from putting their idle cash to work.",2024-08-26
@Just the Millionaire next door It's almost like there are more buildings/property now AND the currency in which we are referencing the value are worth less than yesteryear.....that nominal number is meaningless.  Just a tad bit of commonsense with a touch of finance 101 can do wonders for people.,2024-08-26
"@kata No. The reasons that prices rise and fall in insurance are driven by claims experience, and the amount of capital companies are prepared to put at risk. Everest, like many other reinsurers has scaled back their exposure to Hurricanes and other Cat risk, which reduces the availability of capital and drives up pricing. They have scaled back because they have lost money writing these risks.",2024-08-25
"@Far Horizon Just thought you might this interesting, an analysis of the Bermuda based Everest Group, the reinsurance company of choice for many US companies and fourth largest in the trade, includes the paragraph ""The company says its exposure to Southeast US wind risk, stemming mainly from hurricanes, has fallen since 2017 to 8.4% of equity for a storm that has a 1 in a 100 chance of occurring in a given year, down from 11.6%."" One could have concluded a cut was in order not a 15% increase wouldn't you think?",2024-08-25
"@kata Insurance only works by the law of large numbers. Claims happen to some policyholders and not to others in a random manner (but there’s are trends in specific risk areas) by the nature of the business, the policyholders without claims subsidies the policyholders with claims. Yes, admitted insurers are regulated state by state, but insurers have to run as big a risk pool as possible to maximise the benefit of the law of large numbers. Insurers have to make money or they can’t attract the capital they need to pay claims. If premiums and deductibles are “too high”, then people don’t have to buy insurance. Problem is the risk of losing your home is too high to choose not to insure unless you really can’t afford it. Everything is more expensive with inflation, why not insurance?",2024-08-24
"@Chop1190 Fine, but the way they are doing it is outright discrimination.",2024-08-23
@Far Horizon isn’t this a state by state industry with different regulations different laws and diff actuarial experience? How can you or they generalize across geographical areas? Why does an earthquake in California matter to me in Florida? I feel for my fellow Americans but I shouldn’t be asked to pay their insurance bills. And no one makes claims from the seasonal incidents that befall most homeowners. The deductibles are too high and the upward revision in individual rates makes it prohibitive.  I think an investigation by a congressional body that could expose what practices the insurance business apparently uses to shift risk in opposition to mandatory  state regulations.,2024-08-23
@umbauqua man Travelers (and every other insurance co) has the right to determine the risk it wants to take on.  Seems to me that it is being smart.,2024-08-23
