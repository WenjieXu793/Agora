"@Jeremy Blum The monthly correlation (last 30 years) between LNC's stock price and the 10-yr treasury yield is a NEGATIVE 0.26 (not much different than the daily, as expected).   The numbers are what they are.   You're right, but the correlation isn't that strong.",2024-10-02
@Dynamic_Value_Investor That's probably on a daily basis.  I Looked at it on a monthly basis.  The charts of the two are quite similar.,2024-10-02
"@Jeremy Blum Over the past 15 and 30-year periods, the correlation coefficient between LNC's stock price and the 10-yr treasury yield has been a NEGATIVE 0.27 for both periods, meaning lower yields have been a modest tailwind for LNC's stock price.Over the past 15 years, the correlation coefficient between XLF and the 10-yr yield is a POSITIVE 0.22.   The XLF doesn't go back 30 years.",2024-10-02
"@Mrjs I did …. and luckily I have been out of HRTG for about a month now.  I was about to get back in but Helene saved me because I wanted to wait til I knew it’s severity.  The 60 min hit piece….wow, never saw that coming.  HRTG will have great Q3 numbers but poor Q4 numbers.  I will buy back in at some point once it bottoms.",2024-10-02
@Jeremy Blum price to book matters to me and honestly the drop in NW was concerning until I understood why,2024-10-01
@Fred. L. Everything you said above is smoke and you keep avoiding the point that lower interest rates should benefit LNC.  I have already supported that case by showing the huge impact higher rates had on net worth and proving the stock has traded with interest rates.  Warren Buffett watching his book value is a third support you just don’t get.  Too much in the weeds to see the big picture.  Matched durations of insurance companies is true but just the smoke of someone who doesn’t understand the stock market.LOL,2024-10-01
"@Jeremy Blum Jeremy you are a troll who twists statements. Lets run thru some examples. 1) ""Your statement that all stocks trade with interest rates is ridiculous.""Pls point out where I said this. I said that stocks tend to trade with interest rates in general. I said that value/yield oriented names tend to be even more correlated with interest rates. I'm not talking about the Mag7 which led the rally in 2023 while the S&P 492 barely gained anything. Do you actually disagree with the point that stocks tend to trade with interest rates in general, because lower rates implicitly allow a higher trading multiple? 2) ""I agree the life insurance write off hurt the stock. So why repeat that?""I repeated it because you never said that. The closest thing I can find is you said ""other things happened."" 3) ""I already said I agree insurance companies match duration of assets and liabilities.""No, you never said that. All you did was try to argue that banks match duration of assets and liabilities...which fyi is impossible. The duration of their liabilities is very close to zero. Cash deposits can walk overnight, and CDs tend to be fairly short. Meanwhile banks were out buying 10yr treasuries for their asset books. 4) ""I have already proven NW book value matters to Warren Buffett""LOL, this is my favorite. Whether its true or not, you didn't prove it, you just stated it.",2024-10-01
@Data Doge totally agree there is way more here than interest rates.  Very complex company.  My point is lower interest rates should help this stock and the stock has moved with rates for years.  Thanks for your agreement.,2024-09-30
@Fred. L. You have no idea what I think and keep ignoring my point.  I already said I agree insurance companies match duration of assets and liabilities.  I agree the life insurance write off hurt the stock.  So why repeat that?  Are you some kind of robot? Not what this discussion is about.Your statement that all stocks trade with interest rates is ridiculous.   The stock market rose strongly in 2023 and most of this year despite high interest rates.  LNC didn’t.You don’t understand the concept of thin or low net worth.  IT CAUSES MANY INVESTORS TO STAY AWAY.  Those investors are likely to return when NW is stronger.  Lower interest rates will do that.,2024-09-30
"@Data Doge Equities trade with interest rates in general. Thats like saying 2+2 = 4. lower interest rates support a higher trading multiple. Yield oriented names like LNC, or telecom's, or tobacco, REITs, Pipes, Utes, etc are even more correlated with interest rates because they are valued to some degree of yield spread vs the ten year treasury. But J Blum thinks LNC is a bank. He doesn't understand things like duration and mismatch of liability and asset books. He makes statements like ""probably because their NW was thinner"" or ""I have already proven NW book value matters to Warren Buffet."" I think he is just a troll who doesn't understand the life industry and is reaching for something with silly statements like those. I'm waiting for him to quote Chauncy Gardener next...",2024-09-30
"@Fred. L.   this is very true. Been following the company ever since that kitchen sink quarter. One thing I will add is that it wasn't just the term life book it was practically the ENTIRE life book. Then the CFO decided to leave for ""personal reasons""... yeah there's been more to this story than interest rates. I will say that my view splits the middle of the argument between you two. I trade around a core position of LNC and it's currently roughly 6% of my book, so needless to say I'm invested and hoping substantially more stock appreciation. I tend to agree w/ Fred that it appears that the company will not be able to buyback stock for quite some time as they've made it crystal that they would rather retire expensive pref equity before buying back common. But I also agree with J Blum that from a high level the company ironically does seem to trade in tandem w/ interest rates.",2024-09-30
"@Fred. L. Other things happened, but the LNC stock chart follows too closely to interest rates to ignore it.  LNC's net worth was hit harder by falling interest rates than most other insurers.  Probably because their NW was thinner.  I have already proven NW book value matters to Warren Buffett and to the stock market.  But stay in your little world.",2024-09-30
"@Jeremy Blum Do you even follow this name? Everyone else here knows LNC has traded on a series of specific events. When the new CEO Ellen Cooper took over, in late 2022 she decided to kitchen sink almost the entire long term life book and take a series of reserve charges that were completely unexpected by the street. The stock price dropped like a rock in immediate response. Then in early 2023 there were legit questions surrounding LNC's commercial real estate loan portfolio for credit risk issues, as well as questions if the dividend would be cut. Since then there as been a slow stabilization of the business and a gradual move upward in stock price.",2024-09-29
"@Fred. L. ""Thats why it appears you are the only person in the world having a GAAP discussion when it comes to the life insurance industry.""Not just me, THE WHOLE MARKET disagrees with you. The stock has totally moved with interest rates the past 5 years. Almost like clockwork. Stock investors think differently than industry insiders. That is what you are struggling with.  You are soooo fixated on present values of assets and liabilities that you totally missed the close correlation between LNC stock prices and interest rates.  LOL",2024-09-29
"@Jeremy Blum Now take it one step further.  Look at the stock chart for LNC.  When rates were going down in 2020, the stock price shot up.  When interest rates went up starting in early 2022, almost like clockwork, the stock price started going down, and then down some more as rates kept going up.  When rates leveled out in late 2023, the stock price leveled out and drifted a little up.",2024-09-28
"@Fred. L. WOW! OK, I guess I'm back to my original question, Have you ever read a balance sheet???Look at net worth of LNC on 12/31/20, it was $22.7 billion.  Now look at last quarter, it was $7.9 billion.  Why did it change?  Almost all the change was a category of NW called ""Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)""That went from $8.9 billion on 12/31/20 to -$4.4 billion on 6/30/24.  That is almost all due to changes in values of the securities portfolio due to higher interest rates.  Rates go back down and...voila, net worth goes back up.A $13.3 billion decrease in NW due to changes in interest rates IS NOT A WASH.",2024-09-28
"@Jeremy Blum LOL, I understood your point from the get go, and I told you it was flat out wrong. What part of that are you not getting?The reasons you are wrong are as follows:1) There is not change to the ""net worth"" of a life insurance company based on interest rate movements. They run matched duration books between assets and liabilities. You see to be only focused on the asset side of this equation. If interest rates decrease, the present value of their asset books will increase by the same amount that the present value of their liabilities increases. It's a wash. 2) Life insurance names make their money writing more product, especially products like Annuities and Variable Life...where the attractiveness of these products to the buyer is based on where interest rates are. No one wants to buy these products when interest rates are near zero. Hence a lower rate environment is not good for growth.",2024-09-27
"@Fred. L. You keep ignoring or not understanding my point, so I’ll make it simple for you. One of the reasons I’m in the stock is lower rates will increase book NW, which I expect to result in a higher stock price. I could be totally wrong, but that is part of what I am betting on. I know your fixated on something else, which I actually agree with you on, but I expect lower rates to help the stock price.  I’ll put it another way.  This isn’t about what lower interest rates will do to the balance sheet, income statement or customer counts, it’s about what it does to the stock price.You don’t have to agree with my point but do you understand it now?",2024-09-26
"@Jeremy Blum I cant explain things for a third time. I've explained to you twice now why 2+2 does not equal 5, and all you do is write back ""2+2 = 5, Warren Buffet plus other famous people know that, you are wrong and I am right."" ""but I'm tired of this"" is code for its time to stop conversing with an internet troll.",2024-09-26
"@Fred. L. So you know what my point is and I don't?  LOL!My point all along is the impact on the stock price of lower interest rates. I have proven my point.  Warren Buffett is just one but the best known example.  This IS a stock discussion board.  At the end of the day what happens to the stock matters most.""But I’m tired of this"". Code for I lost this argument.",2024-09-26
