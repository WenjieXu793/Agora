"Just re-read your article and you were spot on in your closing paragraphs. Here’s your quote:“I think steel prices are still coming down and the performance of RYI will continue to deteriorate (relative to 2022) in the coming months. As such there is a strong possibility that the market price will continue to decline in the short term. You might want to wait for more bad news first.But I am not a technical analyst and I will leave it up to you to decide when to enter.I am a long-term fundamental investor. As such, I try to look at how the business will perform over the next decade or so. My valuation is also from this perspective. This is not an analysis or valuation for those looking for gains over the next few months.”A year after this article, and with share price dropping another third, would love for you to update your analysis for the last 12 months of operating performance. Then, restate your margin of safety based on the current share price.You may find you can title your article “now is the time!”Also, just wanted to say thank you. I’ve kept RYI on my watchlist since reading your article last year and just built a large position (at least for me) over this last month. Looking forward to the underlying value to be recognized…and I’ll enjoy the dividend while I wait. Thank you again!",2024-09-27
Pretty impressive video of a highly-automated Ryerson sheet-metal fab plant:www.youtube.com/......don't have a good sense of how unique this is vs competitors are doing similar things??,2024-09-16
