"@theMEtraders -- Warren Buffett dismisses the value of book value.  It is easily manipulated by overpaying for assets,  not a reflection of market value, among other issues.   We've seen evidence that MPW had been overpaying for PE owned assets and getting inflated leases in exchange.MPW has also been keeping the book value of closed down hospitals on their books without revalue them.  They also repossessed the the Steward assets (including multiple closed down facilities) and has new lessees with poor credit rated lessees (didn't even meet the minimum requirements Steward set for being a qualified bidder).It's also about the same ""book value"" when the stock was over $22 and it still collapsed to as low as $3 a share.   Even a $6 there are a lot of investors that aren't buying it.  Good luck.",2024-10-08 11:27:58.307541
"@Fabso B ok, my initial impression was the credit being offered to the transitional opcos was for w/c purposes for funding of short term items, operating losses, supplies, salaries etc.I thought it was vague as to who would fund deferred capex, which of course Stewie was famous for.  Depending on the location this could be serious $.  why would a transitional operator agree to fund that.",2024-10-08 11:27:58.307541
"@Runningbeer First of all, I want you to note that this OpCo discussion is a minor issue in my MPW investment case, more or less a cherry on this investment cake. I tried to explain my point of view with a few sources, it is just my understanding of the things, but maybe it helps…. English is not my native language but I tried my best… :-DYour question: ""where in any of the dockets does it say the proceeds will go to MPW""-> Nowhere, you won’t find any of the separate agreements between MPW and the new operators (everybody is waiting for more information on this topic…). Docket 2776 – sale to honorhealth – page 26/222: ""For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer’s (=HonorHealth) rights with respect to any MPT Real Property shall be governed by AGREEMENTS SEPARATE [...] from this Order among the Buyer (=HonorHealth) and MPT."" -> Except for the information that was published in the press release on 09/11, there is no information available about those separate agreements between MPW/MPT and the new operators.Your question: “I know the RE for the 23 hospitals got transferred to MPW in exchange for the Space Coast Hospitals.”-> No, the hospital real estate was only leased to Steward. MPW is and has been the owner of the real estate. MPW got the right to release the hospitals asap to new (interim) operators and (as far as I understand the deal) the OpCo values of the other Steward hospitals in exchange. Your question: ""Where is it written MPW had taken possession of both RE and opco?"" -> As I said MPW is already the owner of the real estate. -> Regarding the OpCo transfer I think the key is the global settlement (docket 2610 - ""Final order approving the global settlement""). We have to search for Steward's interest in the hospitals/OpCos, its transfer and the purchase price.e.g.: ""Closed Hospitals"" (docket 2610 - P.39/77): ""The Debtors (=Steward) shall convey or abandon their INTERESTES in the Closed Hospitals TO MPT on an “as-is, where is” basis after removing any hazardous materials, medical records and medical equipment. MPT shall not have any OBLIGATION TO REIMBURSE the Debtors... -> Transfer OpCo to MPW without remuneration (except for the price of the global settlement....)!!!Specified MLI Hospital Transition (= the hospital OpCos under interim management - docket 2610 P.33/77):""The Debtors (=Steward) shall (...) convey or otherwise TRANSFER THEIR INTEREST in each of the Specified MLI Hospitals (including any inventory, FF&E or other personal property (...) to the applicable DESIGNATED OPERATOR, without successor liability and free and clear of all liens, claims, interests and encumbrances (other than purchase money security interests and capital leases, in each case of equipment and other personal property) on an “as is, where is” basis, as promptly as practicable, and subject to entry by the applicable Designated Operator into documentation reasonably acceptable to the Debtors and the applicable Designated Operator (which, for the  avoidance of doubt, SHALL NOT REQUIRE any Designated Operator to ASSUME ANY LIABILITIES beyond those expressly contemplated herein)""-> Transfer OpCo to the DESIGNATED OPERATOR (but MPW designates every operator and decides which operator will receive the OpCo!!).“MPT shall DESIGNATE an operator (each a “Designated Operator”) for each MLI Hospital (other than the Space Coast Hospitals).” (docket 2610 - ""Final order approving the global settlement"" – P.31/77)“Non-Transition Notice”""if the Debtors’ interest in any Specified MLI Hospital has not been conveyed or transferred to a Designated Operator, the Debtors shall promptly convey or abandon their INTERESTS in such Specified MLI Hospital TO MPT on an “as-is, where is” basis"" -> If there is no designated operator transfer OpCo to MPW!!!-> In case MPW designates an operator the operator gets the OpCo value from Steward, in case there is no operator MPW gets the OpCo value (MPW „owns“ the Steward OpCos).Just to be clear on the purchase price (docket 2776 - sale to honorhealth – page 4/222): “MPT having designated the Buyer (=honorhealth) as the Designated Operator for the Purchased Assets in accordance with the Global Settlement; and the Debtors (=Steward) having determined that the GLOBAL SETTLEMENT would maximize the VALUE OF THEIR ASSETS, INCLUDING THE PURCHASED ASSETS; and the Debtors having filed and served the Notice of (I) Designation of HonorHealth as Designated Operator for, and Sale of, Mountain Vista Medical Center, Florence Hospital, and Tempe St. Luke’s Hospital naming the Designated Operator as the BUYER for the PURCHASED ASSETS in accordance with the GLOBAL SETTLEMENT.-> The Purchase Price for the OpCo = global settlement deal = MPW paid the price.- We know there is value in every hospital opco, especially those hospital OpCos under interim management ( seekingalpha.com/... )- In case you think, there is no opco value (hint: it is wrong), you should readdocket 2076 (STALKING HORSE BID PROTECTIONS FOR ORLANDO HEALTH):P. 5-6/10: ""Orlando Health calculated that initial bid based on 7.6x multiple of $60.4 million of EBITDARM, and was interested in acquiring the real property underlying the hospitals. (…) Orlando Health had improved upon its original bid, which included a Total Enterprise Value (PropCo and OpCo) of approximately $465 million representing an 8.25x multiple of $60.4 million of EBITDARM. (…) Orlando Health also had indicated that it believed the real property underlying the hospitals had a value of between $175 million to approximately $200 million. (….) Orlando Health was willing to consent to the outcome of an allocation agreement or dispute resolution, so long as the allocation of value to the real property was less than $275 million."" -> medicalpropertiestrust.gcs-web.com/...-> With this MPW data we are able to calculate the EBITDARM for each Steward market. Take a multiple somewhere between 7 and 8,5 and subtract MPW real estate to get opco values for each Steward market. We will receive OpCo values (without real estate) between 150.000 – 300.000 / bed. -> In the end we get OpCo values for the 15 hospitals under interim management somewhere between 0.6 bn and 1.2 bn (my guess)To put it in a nutshell:- MPW paid Steward a few hundred million to get Steward out of the hospitals AND to get the OpCos from Steward. - MPW had a much stronger negotiation position, because OpCos loose value as soon as the hospitals close. Because Steward was under pressure, I assume MPW paid a good price for the OpCos. - Every OpCo that has no operator will be transferred to MPW directly. Every OpCo that has a new operator will be transferred to the new operator. But every new operator has to negotiate a separate deal (at least for the leasing terms and with 90% possibility for the OpCo transfer) with MPW first.  -> I can’t imagine, that MPW will give away the valuable OpCos (at least $150.000/bed) for free PLUS a leasing reduction for the first years. _________________________________________________IN THE END everything from those separate deals (we know they exist) is unknown and speculation. So we have to wait for a press release.SORRY FOR THIS LOOOONG ANSWER.... :-D",2024-10-08 11:27:58.307541

"Yup.  Looking at the price of MPW today, and looking at where I put my profit from MPW after selling all my MPW stock last week when it was at $5.90ish, I really made the right call.  MPW is still down and the stocks where I put the money instead have already help a lot.  I really admire myself.  Ya know?  I really do.  I just seem to have this brilliant innate intuition about when to make the right move and what the right move is.  Probably why I've made so much money in so little time.  I just really admire myself, ya know?  I'm like a great captain of the old days, and the ship is my life.  And I am one fine captain.

"@kkinvesting_value -- MPW still has debt that is rated as junk to pay off, and likely any new debt is still going to be junk.   Management has said they are going to sell assets to pay off debt which is what they have been doing.   The Steward solution has now been replacing Steward's BK with taking on many poor credit risks as replacements.   Ratings services will likely still see this as MPW facing high credit risk from lessee default.   So answer is selling revenue producing assets to pay off debt.   MPW will be a smaller asset and revenue company when they complete the payoff their near term debt.",2024-10-08 11:27:58.307541

"@Wolve_Dawg Ok, obviously the censors of SA work overtime to protect you from a suitable response but I will be as gentle as humanly possible regarding your snide remark about me getting better at investing. You have absolutely no idea about my investing experience over the past 51 years in the market. I’m certainly not Warren Buffet but I was able to retire comfortably and debt free at 62, well over a decade ago. I travel the world, own a fair bit of real estate mortgage free, drive cars that have been featured in magazines and live a life most would envy. Because I have proved over time to be pretty good at this investing thing. Like all honest people, I admit to having made my share of mistakes but I have learned much from the lessons I’ve paid for along the way and I’m better at this now than at any time in the past. This is a terrible company, with a terrible history of destroying wealth over the past 5 years. During a time of all time highs for the overall market, this stock is down nearly 90%, an unmitigated disaster. If stocks are rewarded for growth, this company is the flip side of the coin. The grossly incompetent management is still in place. The NAV and income have been crushed. Anyone buying the incessant hype are playing for a dead cat bounce and that just happened in the big rally from 3 to 5.60. This has all the appearances of a classic pump and dump. There are literally thousands of other companies that represent far better investments than this dog. I hope you find some of them and best of luck.",2024-10-08 11:27:58.307541
