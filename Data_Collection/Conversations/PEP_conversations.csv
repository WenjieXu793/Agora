@Bill the Bag Man agree.  At a macro level the weekly summary that would be somewhat useful would be the number of companies that reported positive earnings growth or revenue growth net inflation.  Of which I think only CCL did.  Would need to check.  But otherwise not a very helpful metric.,2024-10-05
Do companies ever really guide earnings very high? No. They guide on the conservative cautious side. Usually that is why an equity tanks if they miss or guide lower. Nothing earth shattering and it is not saying much about the macro economic picture.,2024-10-05
"@Jry295 Putting $10k in each 1-1-2010 to now with reinvested dividends, I'm getting VOO north of $65k and PEP north of $38k.",2024-10-05
"The purchase of the rest of CELH would seem like a good idea here.  Think about this.  CELH currently has a market cap of $7B.  PEP owns 8.5% of the company, so they would need $6.5B to buy the rest.  Lets say PEP gives CELH a premium to close the deal, so maybe it costs $7.5B -$8.5B, but they would then control a good brand in a rapidly growing market.",2024-10-05
"I do not doubt the brand power of Frito-Lay.  Here in the Northwest, they dominate the shelves and usually have end caps and free-standing displays.  It may be different in other parts of the country, but the Pepsi beverage section is playing a sleepy third place role to Coke and Keurig/DP.  ""Starry"" - the brilliant (?) new introduction to replace Sierra Mist, is rarely available though sometimes in the small-sized cans.  There are many different versions of Mountain Dew, mostly unmemorable.  This is a rare week for Pepsi where the best deals on soda are exclusively theirs.  You would hardly know it from the shopper's carts where they stick to favored non-Pepsi offerings.I'm not investing in the sector at all right now but have been considering one of the Mexican Coke franchises (FMX or KOF).  The weakness in PEP has made me wonder what would happen if DP ditched RC and actually tried to build a popular cola brand.  That would be interesting in this otherwise sleepy sector.",2024-10-05
"Good time to Nibble on a Blue Chip Dividend King.  PepsiCo's history: PepsiCo has increased its dividend for 52 years in a row.  It's the GOAT in ""Snacks & Soda"".",2024-10-05

"@Jeff in Oklahoma City Compare returns from 2010 for both VOO and Pep, and in this case the Pepsi challenge wins. If you're saying that VOO is a nice etf to diversify and make a nice return it is. I happen to also own VOOG, but I also own a great Dividend Port that Pep is part of, and it very nicely hits one of my invest goals. Again, the Pep challenge wins over this period, bottom line you fail miserably.",2024-10-05
"@Jry295 Sure, they are very different and that choice is what makes a market.  I compare all individual stocks to VOO, and if the index totally dominates it year after year after year I don't take on that single stock risk.  Simply take the amount you've put in PEP and compare it to the total return you would have made over that same time with VOO.  The Pepsi Challenge will fail miserably.",2024-10-05
"""From a valuation perspective, PEP doesn't deserve to have a high multiple anymore in my opinion, given that it has lost its pricing power and given the degree of uncertainty surrounding the company. However, the company continues to be a safe bet for income-loving investors, given its strong track record of dividend payouts.""Would these issues you raise not have impact on the growth of said dividend?",2024-10-03
"Thanks for the smart and insightful piece on a long-time core holding of mine. Oddly, I imagine you could have wrote a similar analysis of the snack business (in all candor that’s the main reason I own PEP) and compared it to MDLZ and HSY, who are all vying for the same “snacking moments.” (Full disclosure I own all 3). As a DGI, I’m less concerned about the sales decline (as you astutely pointed out) and more concerned about the debt and its impact on future dividend growth. Although the recent Siete deal has awoke the cynic in me—is management concerned about the consumer trend towards healthier snacks? Could this portend the oft-discussed sales decline precipitated by GLP-1 rather than (or in addition to) the erosion of pricing power? I prefer junk food to remain junk food  and this feels like a reversion to the Nooyi days, and the failed pivot to healthier snacks. Or maybe I’m just paranoid and looking for something that isn’t there ",2024-10-03

"@Jeff in Oklahoma City That's an apples to oranges compare. Granted that VOO had a huge gain (and lucky me I also own VOO). Over the long-term Pep is a solid investment, I've gained thousands and also enjoyed a decent dividend.",2024-10-01

"I stopped buying the almond flour tortillas after the price jumped from $6.99-$7.99 and often on sale, to $12.99 and never on sale. They only sell them at Whole Foods. I know Costco carries them on occasion but I don't shop there.I won't buy any of their other products as they all use avocado oil. Until the genotoxicity issue is settled once and for all, I don't eat avocado. This is one old study but the subsequent have not disproven findings as they are different models: www.tandfonline.com/...And when I say genotoxicity, I'm talking the nasties like double-strand breaks.",2024-10-01
"I have no regrets that I bought ""Dividend King Pepsi"" few years ago.In my opinion the weight loss drugs have caused the stock price to spin it wheels this year.. However, the 10 year chart is still pretty impressive and Pepsi will do just fine in the future.  Plus the dividend increases they give every year add up over time.  So has the price appreciation since my purchase.",2024-10-01
