Edwards seems to be way too aggressive in putting all the eggs in one basket with the spin off. No idea of where that confidence in the tavr market comes from when looking at the diminishing growth in reality.,2024-09-18
"Totally unimpressed by the new CEO after EW had such a great one for years. We'll see...Current problems seem to be around shortages at hospitals slowing down surgeries. Seems this should be very short-term?I bought 1K more shares when the buyout rumor started. That seems to be going nowhere?Anyway, anything under $80 is a bargain IMO. Look at their FCF margin and Return on Ttl Capital -- terrific!",2024-09-18
"@cox87 Never said it was struggling, just positing it may be gaining market share from EW.",2024-09-18
@emcsqard and why is Medtronic struggeling ? :)Weak stock performance! - bad CEO/C-Suite?,2024-09-18
Mismanaged company. Instead of passing the baton to the next generation and growing theyâ€™d  rather sell. Typical medical device company of same old people trying to cash out,2024-09-17
@manoncyber it will not be depressed that long. Share buybacks and good quarters will take this again to old high levels.Nobody has over 40b cash for this,2024-09-17
@cox87 Might be but the price of EW is depressed now. In 2-3 years it might cost much more and with rate cuts imminent financing gets cheaper.,2024-09-16
To whom is $EW losing market share? Or is there a decline in these procedures?,2024-09-16
Not exactly big gap up suggesting takeover.   That said would probably need at least 60B to take out. Good fit for JNJ if they can make the numbers work.,2024-09-16
"@cox87 I would agree.  JNJ spent $16.6B on Abiomed and $13.1B on Shockwave, so I would think any further large acquisitions are unlikely for a couple of years while JNJ pays these down.",2024-09-16
@Edward J. Roche market cap is too high. They spent over 20b on Abiomed and Shockwave. They dont go that big again in next 2-3 years.,2024-09-16
Large market cap for a deal but not impossible. JNJ moving into cardio with several other recent deals.,2024-09-16
