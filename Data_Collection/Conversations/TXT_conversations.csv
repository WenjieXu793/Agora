"Agreed. I don’t hold TXT, but it’s on my watchlist for the time being.",2024-09-30
"Thorough analysis. You conclude: ""I do believe the stock has upside, but it is not my favorite aerospace and defense investment.""I agree. My favorites are currently RTX and LHX. What is your favorite?I did a deep dive into TXT after Leo Nelissen published an article on SA on September 21, 2024, in which he recommended TXT. Here is a comment that I posted there after doing my own research:""I did do further research on TXT, including doing a comparison to RTX, LHX, LMT and GD using a tool available from Schwab. Based upon this analysis as well as research reports from Morningstar and CFRA, I have concluded that all 5 of these aerospace/defense contractors are now fully and fairly priced.TXT had about the poorest year to date performance of the batch, which could explain why TXT now sports the lowest p/e and Price/Cash Flow ratios in the group. TXT didn't take off, so to speak, this year while RTX and LMT were the only two to beat the S&P 500 index. [Fortunately, RTX and LMT were 2 of my Top 10 Holdings in our family's main portfolio of 26 stocks. I have pruned these positions since then.]I find the growth of the drone business of TXT appealing, but not enough so to buy the aerospace company with the lowest yield (being very close to zero) in the group, even though most analysts envision 12-month price appreciation potential of 15-20%. It's certainly worth keeping my eye on, along with HII, as I continue to monitor these aerospace/defense contractors.In assessing my opinion, it's appropriate to keep in mind the fact that my threshold for buying stocks has risen as the major U.S. market indices are at all time highs and interest rate cuts have been fully factored into stock prices. As a result, I am increasingly determined to harvest my gains rather than to plant new seeds.""",2024-09-30
"On Bell Helicopter. Good company and some good people. Glad to see new leadership there, Danny will turn it if anyone can.3 question's for Bell Leadership - 1. What is the Bell goal on number of civil helicopter's sold per year and how close have they come to that in last couple of years?2. Of total Civil sales goal, how many were the 505 and what is it's profit margin, if any3. Will the 525 ever get FAA Certification? Think it's been 10 years now since HAI introduction, hardly ""advanced state of the art"" now, except fly-by-wire.Answers to the above questions should give an idea of future success and profitability.",2024-09-26
