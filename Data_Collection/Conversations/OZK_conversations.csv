"The only lesson learned from 2008 is that bubbles need to be even bigger so yes easy to understand the push back against consolidation lest everyone jump aboard the whole *""Intel the entire US economy!""* craziness. Short $gs Goldman Sachs strong sell. *SOMETHING* needs to be done about New York City Community Bank. Force Goldman Sachs to buy that is my solution and *MAKE* GS become a Bank. The whole reason to create the mania in the first instance is to make a fortune in the ensuing bust. Banks don't do that $gs does that. Long $wec Wisconsin Energy strong buy. One way to solve the so called ""electricity crisis that can only be solved by nuclear power"" is to use a brand new coal fired solution not that Pennsylvania would ever try that of course. Long $mdu strong buy that one supports the local economy big time.",2024-09-26
@Tadpoles_UK.... I understand what you are saying ... but if someone bought at this price 10 years ago then they paid too much.,2024-09-25
"@airlarr I don't have the numbers going back to the year 2000, but I purchased JPM in the fall of 2011 at about $33 per share.  It's now around $210.  And lots of dividends along the way.Of course, some banks had to do catastrophic and highly dilutive levels of share sales during the Great Recession to meet capital requirements.  And some also were essentially forced by the government to complete unattractive acquisitions for the good of the overall economy.Banking is a risky area because banking itself is all about taking risks while also trying to mitigate them.  And you don't find out how well those risks are mitigated until it is too late.  That's why I like a CEO like Jamie Dimon who is rarely talking glass half full.  He's always telling his audience about the risks we face.  And Gleason has an exceptionally sophisticated approach to risk mitigation in the CRE space.  Listening to the OZK conference call allows one to appreciate the care taken with their loans.",2024-09-23
"@airlarr Thanks for sharing that list - interesting picks for sure. Admittedly, I never looked into $NWG and $PCG. It looks like they deserve some time to analyze.",2024-09-23
"@Deep Value Ideas Another idea for you. I was curious if any banks have done well since 2000, do they help a portfolio long term??? YES!! OZK is one of several (most are dogs). www.statmuse.com/...So this list is a good resource. Personally I have decided to reduce all my individual holdings and buy more etfs, SPGP, GRPM, QUAL, and more. These excellent etfs could offer ideas of good stocks to buy. Larry",2024-09-22
"@airlarr Thanks a lot for the positive feedback. Yes, if we get a recession, banks will get hammered and I'd expect a small bank with a concentrated exposure to take an above-average hit. I agree on a strong recovery thereafter, but it takes some risk tolerance to stand the drawdown. I own $OZK alongside a few larger names in a broadly diverisifed portfolio - that's my way of managing risk (and of course having built the appropriate conviction in an investment so that I don't get cold feet when things take a turn for the worse).",2024-09-20
This administration is doing everything they can to prevent corporate mergers. One problem with this is how they going to get those higher taxes from corporations if they prevent them from making money.,2024-09-17
My only surprise is that there was nothing in there about the impact of bank mergers on climate change.Yellen yaps about the role of climate change in Treasury decisions all the time...,2024-09-17
"Short the banks. With this new rule, and the rule for increased reserve requirements, in addition to the massive upside-down portfolios the banks hold in bonds and real estate, there is a major downside brewing up in the banking sector.",2024-09-17
"@2021investor Lower Mortgage rates will lead to refinancing at lower rates, devaluing mortgages via higher CPR, and leading to lower interest components. If you think service fees will salvage the lost value, then go ahead. The only thing going for banks in a declining-rate environment is 1) IBD, and 2) Lower funding cost + higher credit spread on loan book, but credit event risk is usually higher when rates first start dropping, so, that's why you're seeing banks reduce duration on loans (lower returns), I use $MS as an example.",2024-09-13
"@Pearl Gray Equity and Research Why not? Nobody's taking out mortgages right now. With lower rates, the floodgates will open again.",2024-09-12
"@MileHighMoney30 It's both. ""The market"" is a lot of different people doing different things. Sometimes the things they do has a common theme. However, news articles talk about ""the market"" as if it's one individual. Trying to understand the psychology of ""the market"" is like trying to understand what direction an army of ants will scatter. Depending on the environment, incentives, and stimulus, it can be all sorts of things.Some people are expecting 25bps, others are expecting 50bps, some changed their minds given X or Y news. On balance, the net change is reflected in the market. Zoomed out, it looks ""random"" to a series of economists and other academics. When it finally happens next week, the immediate result will be corrected towards what actually happens. But the overall long-term result ""should"" be that the economy improves with rate cuts, depending on how severe the economy was damaged with the rate hikes.That's my take at least from a random guy on the internet.",2024-09-11
"Excellent report! I agree, OZK is the very best traditional regional bank!! If and when we get more weak economic data, the stock market and especially banks will get hammered, even from these levels. Some investors might not realize that banks usually have big loan losses during a recession and are forced to sell stock at very cheap prices. The stock recovery can be long and painful. Historically OZK stock rebounds better than most banks, due to a quality loan portfolio. Larry",2024-09-11
@MileHighMoney30 Rate cuts are good for banks looking to grow their loan books.,2024-09-11
"Im confused, I thought a larger rate cut meant the economy was struggling more than we would like but now a smaller rate cut is bad? Which is it?!",2024-09-11
This is the start of possibly a very dramatic easing cycle so hardly bad news for Banks as credit becomes more widely available and as there be no shortage of Government need to borrow let alone all of the massive industries currently running flat out to meet demand and still hardly immaterial inflation even Banks should make money here. Long $f Ford Motor Company strong buy,2024-09-11
Banks were down previously because a 50 bsp cut was on the table. Letâ€™s pick whatever nonsense headline fits our narrative today. NII is the story this week with JPM cooling expectations. This has overshadowed banks who made positive remarks and reaffirmed guidance. Place your bets accordingly.,2024-09-11
@Deep Value Ideas i have both C & P in a w plans to sell 50% of common at $50. I loaded up just after Silicon Valley crashed.,2024-09-10
"Gleasons share growth = ""dividends reinvested"" activated :-)btw... OZK is offering 5.10% on a 7mo CD....im thinking this friday or monday...5% on a 7. My local CU 4.75 on a 11mo (w no immediate change planned).",2024-09-10
