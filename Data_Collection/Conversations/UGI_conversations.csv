"Utilities are going to be ""where it's at"" when inflations skyrockets due to the massively exploding money supply coming in 2025+ to start 'inflating away the debt'.",2024-10-02
I wonder if a takeover and subsequent sale of the propane business would make UGI a good buy now.,2024-10-01
Did I miss something in April regarding the LPG business? I thought the strategic review resulted in them keeping both Amerigas and the European LPG distribution companies. I thought they exited LPG trading.,2024-09-29
"While we have held UGI for several years, I fail to see how a frozen dividend from a utility (income) position for 3 years is encouraging.",2024-09-27
I hold a good size long position on UGI. Like the attractive dividend. Sold calls at $30 Jan 25. Fine if I get taken out. Thanks for the article.,2024-09-27
Are you not concerned about the West Reading Palmer liabilities?,2024-09-25
"@bradb22 What you say is true.  However, when a dividend aristocrat falls from grace it is usually with a dividend cut.  The dividend here is maintained and is well covered by earnings.  They have an S&P credit rating of A- which is very good.  These are the type of stocks to look for in an expensive market.  My strategy is to take the 6.24% yield and wait for the stock to come around.  Other stocks that are like this are UPS, TROW, and BMY.",2024-09-23
"@jayridescarbon Thank you.  Went to Q2 and Q3 slides as you pointed out this was referring to.  Was hoping a delay of growth in div like XOM before they pulled thru.  UGI plans to freeze it or they call it flat.  Committed to paying it is good at least but still record is gone.  Need to do more reading.  All these long term div players are falling dead or flattened.   Sigh.  WAG.  VFC.  Freeze or cut, normally a bad sign.   Thank you again.",2024-09-20
"@SteadySlowInvestor From the May, 2024 earnings call:On the next two slides, I'll comment on our outlook through to fiscal 2027 as we adhere to this framework. UGI has a long track record of paying dividends. As we balance our priorities over the next two years, we remain committed to preserving that history. Between fiscal 2024 and 2026 as we focus on strengthening the balance sheet and stabilizing AmeriGas, we expect that dividends will stay flat, while still achieving a payout ratio close to 50%. Now as we move to fiscal 2027, we anticipate returning to our targeted 4% dividend growth rate over the long term.",2024-09-20
@SteadySlowInvestor   Give me a day or two to look.  I believe it was in one of their earnings transcripts.,2024-09-20
@jayridescarbon Can you link where they offered guidance for a frozen dividend?   Thanks.,2024-09-20
