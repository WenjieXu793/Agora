for MS it's cheerleading time on the shares while quietly reducing position.,2024-10-05
Now it’s way to late to come with overweight ratings. I’m thinking about trimming my position because it’s running to hot lately. One of my best buys in 2020 at 15 bucks and a crazy YoC now. Greetings from Germany,2024-10-04
"I have been bullish on WMB, but this week the performance was off the charts.  On almost any metric you look at, WMB is overbought.  Therefore, I am trimming my holdings.",2024-10-04
"@I_like_preferreds  Because they only issue 'buy' ratings when there's already momentum* and/or the 'early money' from internal due diligence already has been made.* which reinforces the perceived 'correctness' of their call to uninformed eyes -- eg ""look, it's been on FIRE! So clearly it will continue to go higher!""A good rule of thumb is to NEVER invest based on when 'analyst' recommendations are released ..",2024-10-04
Now????? Really bad analyst. Why not when it was $35.,2024-10-04
The maximum chart on this company is astonishing Makes me punchy just  looking at it  Unless their assets are so much greater than EPD or ET… ??,2024-10-04
"Despite the false narrative of trump and the republicans, as I have been writing on Seeking Alpha for a few years now: we live in a ""New Age of Energy Abundance"" and the U.S. is energy independent (by an estimated ~3 million boe/d) and is the #1 petroleum producer on the planet and the #1 LNG exporter on the planet. This is one reason the XLE Energy ETF is one of the worst performing sector ETFs over the past decade (if not the worst ...) and if it wasn't for Putin & Netanyahu's wars, the results would have been even worst, and likely significantly so. Meantime, note the American ""big-3"" (Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips) aren't making any significant investments in wind, solar, and battery backup capacity. As a result, they are increasingly ill-prepared for the 21st Century of electrification and they are increasingly contributing to global warming, and we saw the results of that with the horrific recent hurricane that laid waste to so much of the Southeastern U.S. and took more than 100 lives.There is no way the planet will stop burning up as long as the ""Big-3"" (little 3?) refused to invest some of their cash-flow directly into renewables. Further, the supposed ""carbon sequestration"" is a total disaster, ineffective, and waste of time, money, and resources. What a world!",2024-10-02
"Read that Permian is getting more gassy, so great timing by WMB.",2024-10-01
"I own a large position and am considering trimming it some.Great company and great investment to own.  However, it's over-valued right now.  If I didn't already own it, I wouldn't consider buying at anything over $40. Price has gotten ahead of itself.",2024-09-25
"@WretchedBabbler Yes, and it has likely a lot to do with rates coming down. Lower rates and yields make midstreams more attractive...",2024-09-25
"I feel that your assessment of Willams stock is correct at this price level and has been a core holding in my portfolio for three years. I would also note that the four other C-Corp midstreams I hold are also trading at similar fair market price levels, including Oneok, Antero Midstream, Plains-PAGP and Kinder Morgan. The whole sector has been rerated among many of the C-Corps.",2024-09-25
"Agreed WMB has many positives, and it's TRANSCO division is the crown jewel. However, WMB has a lot of debt on the balance sheet which must be rolled over. This may not be the ideal entry point for new equity acquisition. As a holder of pipeline shares, I'll wait for a better entry point. ",2024-09-25
"Thanks, holding WMB long term, up 43% expecting price to move above $50 will continue to be a core holding.",2024-09-25
WMB great company however highly valued currently I have reinvested dividends elsewhere,2024-09-23
"I've owned these shares for just a few months in a managed account. they are up over 28% during that time frame, to me, an extremely well run company with a decent dividend as well.",2024-09-17
@SJF2005 That is the way to do it.  I got in at $26 so not too bad.,2024-09-17
"I don't own Williams shares, but I am invested in several other midstreams;  I don't see a significant risk in the long-term demand for NG, primarily due to the projected increase in demand for electric power consumption as soon as next decade, driven by growth in the application of AI, which is expected to more than double our current National Grid requirements.  Much of this new demand will result from the construction of new Data Centers around the country, the function of which will be to crunch and distribute information using large banks of AI computers supporting Cloud technology.Of course, NG isn't the only source of future electric power to feed this new demand; resurgence in nuclear power is also being seriously considered, but not from past generations of large power producing reactors. Instead, small on-site dedicated nuclear power generators, smaller-scale and safer than large production facilities, are planned to be available within 2 years.  One manufacturer, NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE), has developed a portable nuclear reactor which can be hauled like a semi-trailer to location, set-up and put into operation quickly, and be easily, or be removed and replaced with a new unit if,  or when necessary.",2024-09-17
@pakrolltide bought in at $8 in 2020. Time to get out soon. But might ride it to $50+. Safe dividend stream but mature here.,2024-09-17
"@Laura Starks Are the volumes already committed to the projects in flight? If so, do you know the future cash flows upon completion of these project?",2024-09-15
Very good article.  Bought WMB at $26 so I have made a ton.  Thanks for the other four suggestions as I am finally starting to look for some income at the age of 64.,2024-09-12
