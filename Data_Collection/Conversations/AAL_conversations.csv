"One of the follies of reading analyses from amateur securities analysts in SA is that it takes time to distinguish between those writers who have the training, experience, resources, and depth of understanding of the companies they choose to write about from those self-taught analysts who simply write good persuasive essays that may sound thorough, logical, or authoritative but lack any real insights that add value for investors. The danger in this is that we all have a greed streak in us, and when such an author suggests that outsized gains could or should be available by buying shares of ""cheap"" stocks, we easily fall into the trap of reading on and allowing the author to take us through his shallow, incomplete, but persuasive discussion of the easily available facts the market already knows and has priced in. In the case of AAL, for example, one could easily be seduced into throwing money at it because of its ""cheap"" valuation. However, without a keen understanding of what high debt, low margins, expensive labor contracts, and a sub-optimal hub system mean to a company with that kind of operating leverage in a dog-eat-dog industry, and without knowing how it got there in the first place, it's likely you may be surprised by your investment results. As an American Airlines veteran who worked for the organization 28 years until mandatory retirement, let me say this about the company. (1) They will continue to put out an excellent industry standard product. That means they will continually modernize their fleet, invest heavily in maintenance,  training, and system improvements, and they will pay enough to attract competent and talented employees in every category.(2) They know the company's financial condition cannot withstand union job actions and the accompanying reputational damage from schedule and baggage unreliability, so they will continue to support industry leading pay scales for employees - like the $375/hr they're paying narrowbody captains. These contracts have escalators and will offer no help for margins, ever. The loss of trust between its mature labor force and management in recent decades is one of American's greatest obstacles to growth.(3) They will continue to lose market share both domestically and internationally to financially stronger carriers. For example, American/One World was recently the dominant US carrier to South America. When Delta took a 20% stake in LATAM, however, in exchange for LATAM switching to Skyteam, American had no answer. Now Delta dominates South American markets. Again, with American and Delta in a fight for dominance at LAX, Delta has been able to invest in growing its north-south operations along the west coast, thereby capturing lucrative LAX frequent flyer market share. American has no answer other than its very out-of-the-way Phoenix hub, having given up both its hubs at SFO and SJC under pressure from United, Alaska, and Southwest after having invested heavily in the past to buy California regional airline Air California which had a great many west coast assets.(4) American has gaping service holes in the Pacific Northwest and to mainland Asia except through its OneWorld partners, particularly to China and India. American once had the financial strength to help support its international partners when they needed help as it did with Japan Air Lines several years ago. Now it doesn't, nor does it have the ability to connect mainland Asian travelers efficiently through or to US locations north of LA and west of Chicago. Consequently, none of the major airlines in China or India are part of the OneWorld Alliance. They all connect through United or Delta.(5) American competes against itself in the northeast. With hubs clustered in JFK, PHL, and CLT, cities with vastly different demographics, American is challenged to coherently allocate its resources to compete efficiently. This wonky hub structure is the legacy of several failed acquisitions following the departure of Robert Crandall, the executive most responsible for American's rise to dominance in the late 20th century. (6) Don't buy AAL shares assuming it will be rebuilding its balance sheet, a daunting task given the company's razor-thin margins that could easily disappear during an economic downturn. Instead, wait until you see a credit upgrade from one of the big ratings agencies like Fitch or S&P - if it ever happens.(7) After needed investments in equipment and employee pay, there isn't a lot left over for shareholders. Curb your enthusiasm. In the meantime, give this author a few years to figure things out.",2024-10-04
"Why do you say AAL has ""Negative free cash flow""?It was positive in both Q1 and Q2:""Generated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion and free cash flow of $1.4 billion in the first quarter.""""Generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion and free cash flow of approximately $850 million in the second quarter.""FCF was also positive in 2023.",2024-09-30
"$AAL nearing a full deal with Citigroup that could yield $2+ billion in add'l loyalty revenues. While it says it has the largest loyalty program, American was out-earned by Delta there, which made nearly $7 billion in payments from its American Express card partnership last year, compared with $5.2 billion for American.www.cnbc.com/...",2024-09-20
