"@RonEDickinson This is one for the grandkids.  The entire sector is in the toilet from a SP vantage.  The overhang of the US election is one of the factors.  Renewables keep getting cheaper.  I think the seeds being sown here will reap durable rewards, but it may take a while.  I'm giving it a decade.",2024-10-04
"Thanks for the coverage.  I too got a lot out of the Investor Day presentation.  I've long been a fan of Connor Teskey -- he's moving up in the Brookfield ecosystem.I too am bullish and belief that this company has the deepest expertise in this sector.  I'm awed by its financial capabilities.  I can't think of another entity that can operate at this scale in the renewables sector.  In a very short timeframe it has acquired a controlling interest in Westinghouse, is in the process of  buying NEOEN and has entered into a 10.5 gigawatt deal with MSFT (bep.brookfield.com/...).  There is a lot of organic growth and other M&A activity.  The company underwrites both aggressively and conservatively.  I find it prudent.Thanks again.",2024-10-04
I have added BEP over last few years and the thesis gets better. I do think it is a stock you can trade into on dips and drips. It is part of BN group and the group extracts fees and profit share (20% of distributions). I decided to invest in the holding company as well. As a European investor I preferred BN for tax reasons although BAM may appeal to income investors. Thanks for the interesting update.,2024-10-04
"@RonEDickinson- while keeping a core set of BEPC shares untouched, I traded 2500 shares bought new at $24 and sold at $32. Then bought 1500 back down at $28.50 and sold at $32.50. I have never gotten full credit on my foreign tax paid, there are too many side impacts  - such as the AMT that get in the way, but others as well.",2024-10-04
"As a Canadian retiree, not worth buying at this point in time. Shares have been flat for a while and other than the dividend I dont expect any capital gains for the1-2 years if that early.",2024-10-04
"@TrustTheMF thanks. I’m not sure what you mean about trading around a core position,  if the stock has flat lined what is the catalyst to get some capital gains.   I get a 100% rebate on the wh tax as a credit off my US taxes.",2024-10-04
"@RonEDickinson- trading around a core position is the way to go with BEPC, especially in a Roth account. Note that accounts that are not tax deferred get hit with Canadian W/H tax on the dividends.",2024-10-04
"@Panzerman Ditto. 4% dividend over at BAM, and a 15-20% annual growth rate of that dividend. Unbeatable.",2024-10-03
"Hard for me to buy BEP with stock price being flat for the past 5 years.  I see all the pretty charts and analysis, but where is the growth?",2024-10-03
I am going the BAM route to take advantage of all the Brookfield empire.,2024-10-03
@TrustTheMF This has always been part of their strategy. They recycle some of their assets for revenue.,2024-09-24
"So what's going on with BEP, given the flurry of asset sales: this one in Spain and also the apparent $1+B gain on selling its 25% share of 1st Hydro in the  UK??",2024-09-24
"@UncleLongHair A couple of important points to keep in mind:1. They likely held this with mostly debt, so the ROE is much greater than the gain on an enterprise value basis for BEP.2. They are still retaining part of the business (a portfolio of regulated solar assets).3. This gain does not include all of the cash flow that they received from the business during their holding period.",2024-09-24
"I think this asset was acquired by TerraForm power in 2018 for $1.2 billion, and Brookfield acquired TerraForm in 2020. Just based on the numbers in the press releases this looks like a modest gain for them.However it is nice to see an actual deal, maybe the ice is starting to crack with rates going back down. They have not reported much in the way of deals in about 18+ months.",2024-09-24
@youngdividend capital recycling is a key component of Brookfield’s business strategy…always has been.,2024-09-24
"Ok, very interesting on the ROI on this from BEP. It looks like they are starting their capital recycling program!",2024-09-24
"I just have BEPC for the capital gains, because the Canadian dividend taxes are not deductible in my country, but still wonder when I can sell.",2024-09-20
@murrskoka   Hummm.... growth and income in a price that has decreased for 3 years,2024-09-10
