"@Krypto Thanks, I appreciate the positive feedback! Yes, Lennar is a well-managed business. Not interested buying it at this level, but definitely a candidate for the watch list.",2024-10-08 09:59:22.447361
"@pakrolltide If the plumbers, electricians, etc. that are working on them had their way, the houses would cost much more, take longer to build, and fewer of them would sell.Those whiners should stick to working on rich people's homes, because the Estados Unidos needs a lot more housing. To do that, they need to be built efficiently and not in flood zones.Either that, or those plumbers, electricians, etc should compete and build better homes, or else shut up and get to work.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@David Harper, CFA This is interesting. It appears that Lennar was hired as GC by developer Hillwood to build 3D printed homes in Austin. Great way for LEN to learn how to build these; how to transport and install these; and see what the closing costs per SF are versus their cost to construct. Then see if it makes sense for them to develop this concept on their own, when and where (if ever) it makes sense.www.iconbuild.com/...",2024-09-29 00:00:00.000000
"@David Harper, CFA Yep, yep! Just to clarify my point, LEN sells spec homes. It's not a contract or custom builder. They definitely seem to understand the value of a pre-sale, putting a home under contract prior to Certificate of Occupancy. Hence the model units, building out communities in phases, managing lot inventory, etc.",2024-09-29 00:00:00.000000

"@Stashley rising tide will lift all boats:“Mortgage and refinance rates today, September 27, 2024: Rates are 81 points lower than 52-week average”finance.yahoo.com/...",2024-09-27 00:00:00.000000
"@Stashley Thanks! In regard to what I wrote ("" LEN has a production model with communities where often homes are sold before/during construction, so I think that's why they focus on start and sales pace.""), I maybe should have written ""pre-sold"" but basically:As opposed to the residential home resale market that is generally individual houses re-sold one at a time (my local market here in RPV, CA and many local markets), LEN builds the majority of its houses in communities . Their 10k says 1,260 communities and here is a huge community north of me in CA: www.lennar.com/...I wanted a new construction and I love Lennar, but LEN doesn't have a community near me, but I visited many communities. Planned communities have build ""model homes"" early and build/sell in ""phases."" You can often visit the model homes before any homes are finished. In a compelling community, you can buy a ""pre-construction"" home. I wish I knew the exact numbers, and of course homes are sold after they are built too, but my point was really that a metric like ""time/days on market"" (a key metric in existing home sales) isn't used by LEN for this reason, and they always talk about start pace and sales pace (per month per community), because those determine the ""velocity"" if you like of the community. Thanks!P.S. A key personal reason that I always liked LEN is: in new planned communities, the model homes that are the basis for pre-sales and sales are typically presented with many desirable upgrades, yet the prices are listed without upgrades, so you think the house will cost $850 but it ends up costing $1.0 million or whatever. But LEN is known for its ""Everything’s Included Approach"" that includes desirable fixtures, finishes (F & F) and SmartTech.",2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
"@David Harper, CFA Amen to #3. That's why TIMING is key in the spec homebuilding business.  You want to be cutting trees and moving dirt before your competitors so you can deliver the first units to be quickly absorbed when the cycle turns up.  But if you time it wrong and long and don't have staying power... Adios, amigo. Watch out below! Haha.Hence NVR and now LEN. Just option the lots and expense/prefund the carry cost in advance assuming you take down no lots. Sure, you give up some upside at the peak in terms of unit volumes and unit margins. But you sure as heck tie up way less capital, and have a better chance of surviving the downturns!",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"@David Harper, CFA Agreed. In my mental model, income levels are the primary correlation factor for home sales. Followed by terms/availability of financing (credit). Meaning not just interest rates to set a monthly mortgage payment, but the LTV of the appraisal, and the required down payment. Which is a function of LTV and borrower credit score. The latter being a function of... drumroll... income level. Ha! :)",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"@David Harper, CFA What makes you say that LEN has many or even most of its units under contract before even starts building, or before the units are C.O.d? I'm not disputing you, I've just never heard that before.",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"@David Harper, CFA Bullish on LEN. They're becoming a less cyclical deliverer of more predictable and stable returns per unit. They've largely exited the land bank business. In my region they are a leader in affordability (once called ""starter homes."") They also rent units out, and they sell vacant CO'd units to rentors. They're also doing townhomes for that.",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"@Walldog2 That's harsh (as the S-1 and details of the Millrose spin have not been published) but you have a point to the extent that a *problem* with unawareness of the planned spin is that it will be a sort of step-function *continuation* of ongoing shift to asset-light which arguably renders the two elements of the article's bear case unpersuasive: historically low P/E due to asset heavy cyclicality, and the futility of relying on a historical equity/asset ratio that was trending higher for good reasons and will now somehow go even higher. In the meanwhile, we LEN longs will enjoy a juicy Millrose stock dividend :)I'm happy to take the other side of the market's myopia over management's somewhat deliberate, temporary shift in gross margin, while the fundamental LEN business continues to perform.",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
This article is worthless by not covering the planned land spinoff which will impact key financial metrics for Lennar,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"@Stashley I've been listening to homebuilder CEO (I've long owned DHI, TMHC, and LEN but will now start trimming my gains) and FWIW my interpretation of their overall view of the impact of lower rates is more complex than most analysts understand. I wrote about it here davidharper.substack.com/... but the TLDR version is:To the homebuilders, lower rates are:1. Positive factor because they enable greater buyer demand due to improved affordability,2. Positive factor because they enable reduced incentives which increases gross margin.  The market is very focused on GM, as we saw from the reaction to LEN's otherwise great Q3 print.3. Negative factor because they increase resale supply (aka, lock-in effect). But this is nontrivial dynamic. As I wrote, ""DHI and TMCH supply new construction which competes against the resale market. Lower rates should increase resale supply. Although new-versus-resale is not a commodity substitution.""... so I do agree with your comment that lower mortgage rates are net bullish for LEN but, for myself, my long position has never much weighed the interest rate dynamics because (at least so far) I viewed it as a good buy under either rate regime.",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"@Stashley LEN does not refer to velocity. As builder, their key pace metrics (discussed on every call) are ""start pace"" and ""sales pace."" In Q3, they mentioned matching start pace and sales pace at ~ 5.4. I suppose (as an analogy to average receivable days), we could say (for example) an average community sales pace of 6.5 per month translates into a 6.5*12 = 78 homes per year and that's 365/78 = 4.7 average days. Unlike *existing* home sales where an ""average time to sell"" metric makes sense, as a new home builder, LEN has a production model with communities where often homes are sold before/during construction, so I think that's why they focus on start and sales pace.Re agents: they are on commission here in CA, so they are easily added in up cycle and inexpensively retained in down cycles. At the same time, a lot of the marginal realtors aren't impactful and many don't really work nearly FT.",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"@OverTheHorizon True, but their top realtors will quickly hit max capacity, so as the cycle extends the agencies will be too quick to hire new agents, then as the cycle turns they'll be too slow to cut those agents.For some reason the agent business model never seems to scale quite like it should. Realtors, consultants, CPAs, etc.",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
@Stashley yes. Existing home sales will rise w lower interest rates and more listings.,2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"But LEN's Q3 earnings were NOT a disappointment. Neither the headline nor the conclusion are quite supported by the article's *impressive* analytics. The market's reaction was (if you believe the sell side) almost entirely due to LEN's *revision* to gross margin guidance. What else disappointed?I think your article is a actually a decent BULL case if you exclude only two items. First, overdependence on a single unreliable metric: the equity ratio. Second, as is so often the mistake, presumption of mean revision to a historical P/E level; ultimately which is a technical indicator more than a valuation measure.I appreciate your're invested in the equity ratio. I read your previous article and couldn't find a strict definition but at < 70%, I'm assuming it's ~ Book equity/ Book Assets. For example, something like Q3's 26.9 mm equity / 38.7 mm assets; or adjusting the assets. But I simply cannot give that ratio much weight, especially in a time series over the last 15 years. As you know, LEN has been actively engaged in a years long asset-light strategy that necessarily implies higher equity/asset ratios. Set aside dubious reliance on book values, an increasing equity ratio is actually a POSITIVE SIGNAL of their progress on their stated strategy!  Your previous article shows the industry's high correlations but that's due to a drop after 2006 (explained by the post-crisis write-downs) followed by a expectant increase, as most of LEN peers are similarly gearing their equity/asset ratios. Put simply, it's not today a reliable indicator of location on the ""cycle"" even as the business might be less cyclical as land is spun off.I've gained a lot on LEN (among my largest positions) so I may trim due to its oversized allocation in my portfolio. But this was another strong quarter by LEN. The valuation is rich by historical comparisons but certainly not in absolute, current terms. The market reacted to single metric, but I view that as typical overreaction. LEN CEO explained why GM, which they somewhat control via volume and market share agenda (incentives), was somewhat deliberately lowered. GMs peaked in 2023 2H at 24.4% and now were back to 22.5%, the same as 2023 Q2. Myopic focus on the GM fluctuation itself hardly warrants a bear thesis.If I zoom back to my thesis, and look at strength in the key measures, it was another strong quarter.P.S. It was also good to hear Stuart talk about Millrose. It's not Quarterra renamed (the venture portfolio), but rather land/REIT spin that we expected.",2024-09-23 00:00:00.000000
"@Stashley @OverTheHorizon Bullish for homebuilders like $LEN indeed, but should also help existing home sales and thus overall supply.",2024-09-23 00:00:00.000000
"Lennar engaged Palantir to redesign its business model.  It was found that the cost of business disruption resulting from expanding and contracting production in response to market conditions was enormous.  The solution—the “Lennar machine”— is to continue to manufacture homes at a steady pace regardless of market conditions, to the benefit of employees, vendors, and supply chains.  LEN adapts to changing market conditions via home designs (smaller, less costly during tight markets; larger during growth periods), and sales and marketing (prices and margins shrink and expand based on market conditions).  This seems to me like an innovative and sensible approach to thriving in a cyclical industry, and financial metrics should be viewed through this lens.  I’m long LEN and PLTR.",2024-09-23 00:00:00.000000
