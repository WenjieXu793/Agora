@Eileen Dover Inflation for so many things at the store are out of control!,2024-09-18
"""Organic net sales were also down 1 percent""  -  not good",2024-09-18
It is called pricing yourself out of the market. I have been buying almost exclusively store brand stuff (other than Tide and a couple things) for years.,2024-09-18
@Peter Jaworowski We can't lift the 50 lb boxes of cereal from Costco.  lol,2024-09-18
"@wboz You should shop at Costco, you'll find cereal prices there are quite reasonable.",2024-09-18
"@wboz Just a very few years ago we were buying the 18oz Cheerios for $1.99 on sale. Now I believe it is over $4.00.  The small 12 oz box is near $3.00 !! I tried the store brand & don't notice much difference. Usually they are the same Cheerios which may have failed the ""look"" that General Mills wanted so they rejected those and repackaged them as store brands.",2024-09-18
I guess the 'eat cereal for dinner because it's cheaper than steak' marketing plan didn't work that well.,2024-09-18
"Considering how expensive a tiny-as box of cheerios with a bunch of plastic wrap inside has got - I don't think anybody is gonna feel too bad for you, General Mills. Especially since you were bragging a few Qs back there was essentially no limit to how much cost you could pass on to the eatin' public.",2024-09-18
It will be good to write also to whom the business was sold.,2024-09-12
@Valuestocks007   As long as they don't use it to over pay  for something else.,2024-09-12
Good plan to sell a business they never really got good at itâ€¦ looking forward to less debt.. more growth and bigger dividends!,2024-09-12
"@Bigjeff0065 Desperate hyperbole from a supporter of the party that works for, by and of the 1%.  Inflation raged around the world post-Covid, but less so in the US than most countries.  But you knew that, didn't you?Conservative economists surveyed by the WSJ say Trump's tariffs and immigration roundup will reignite inflation, which will pummel the middle class:www.wsj.com/...",2024-09-12
"Wages have risen faster than prices for 18 months straight, but you wouldn't know it listening to the mainstream media.  They badly need Republicans in power to give them more corporate tax breaks.  So it's ""inflation, inflation, inflation"" 24/7.  But do tell me again how the MSM is ""liberal"", right wingers.  ",2024-09-11
@Bigjeff0065  Corporations also help starve families by raising rents.  But that's just capitalism at it's most ruthless.  So is that cool with you?,2024-09-11
@Truth in Tension I actually see them coming down. I just picked up a dozen blue crabs for $1/crab. Haven't seen them that cheap in a decade.,2024-09-11
