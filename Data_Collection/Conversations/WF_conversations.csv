"@frcostas Hi, for a retail investor residing in the USA, the withholding tax rate on income from dividends derived in Korea is 15%. In addition, dividend income is subject to 10% income tax rate charged on the withholding tax. So, effective withholding tax rate should be 16.5% on dividends.",2024-09-12
"@rps+ Hi, thank you for your comments, albeit they are a bit tough. I don't think that the loan scandal involving former chairman Son Tae-seung has really been the driving factor for the stock over the past month or so. Let me give you some figures. The local financial regulator FSS revealed on Aug 11 that the relatives of former chairman Son Tae-seung received some KRW 35bn (around $26mn) of inappropriate loans. The stock opened at $32.71 on Aug 12 (Monday), up from $32.57 on the close on Aug 9 (Friday), and closed at $32.41 on the same day. The stock then rallied by 16% until Aug 23 when was the recent price high. Thus, I think it is quite obvious that investors shrugged off the scandal initially. The stock has declined by around 10% since the recent Aug 23 high, which almost mirrors the moves that Woori's peers KB and SHG experienced in the same time frame, which I think is related to broader market concerns about the strength of the economy, including demand for semiconductors. The FSS announced on Sep 3 that it will conduct its regular inspection of Woori Bank earlier than expected, which is unusual and suggests the FSS wants to investigate Woori's lending practices, but the stock barely made any moves on it. Overall, I don't think that Woori's stock has been hammered by the scandal as you suggest. Most likely, the scandal will have little impact on profitability and will involve some punishment for the former management of the bank. Still, it may have negative repercussions for the ongoing M&A deals that the bank is trying to complete as regulators may deny the acquisition of life insurers Tongyang Life and ABL Life, and may jeopardize other M&A deals that its securities arm wants to conduct until the scandal is resolved. That said, I regret that I omitted the scandal from my article as it is still a downside risk for the stock that makes headlines. I will include it for sure if I write a follow-up piece. However, I don't own the stock and have never received any payments other than SA to write it. Also, I think that it is ridiculous to accuse me of pump and dump, when the stock performs the same as the market.",2024-09-12
