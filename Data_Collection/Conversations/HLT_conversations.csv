"I understand why these workers who are basically treated like slave labor want to get paid more because most if not all are living in an overpriced run down apartment unit with either multiple family members or roommates living on top of each other, or still living at home with their parents or grandparents or with multiple family friends all trying to afford to pay for an overpriced home with a 30 year mortgage at a high interest rate all the while trying to raise their children in a pricey society. Most nice hotels will always try to pay the lowest wages and benefits as possible even if that means bringing in all immigrants from Latin countries and Jamaica, or other poor countries where they will be willing to work for very low wages just to gain legal residency into the United States, only to find themselves living in economic poverty and misery in the United States. I’m not sure what the real solution is for the hotel chain to remain profitable, but I might suggest that the hotel should discount a customer’s room for not getting daily cleaning nor extra bathroom supplies and towels. Those less demanding customers should be offered a nice discount on their rooms in order to keep the customer coming back to book a room. This may also allow for the hotel to have less need to hire more workers who do housekeeping, therefore saving the hotel on labor costs.",2024-09-24
