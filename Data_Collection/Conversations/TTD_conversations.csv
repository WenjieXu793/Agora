"Given competition from GOOG, AMZN, META, what is a realistic digital advertising market share long term? Copilot says 1.5% currently. How high can it grow?",2024-10-05
"This is a great company with a greater CEO, Jeff Green. I've held this stock and allowed to become a 10 bagger for me!  And no I don’t own a small number of shares, I own many. I’ve always bought when the neasayers are putting it down and enjoyed its recovery and additional increases. A solid profitable company with great leadership and low debt are the keys to success and this company has them all. Thanks for this analysis and all the others. You produce valuable and insightful product.  Glad I follow you!",2024-10-05
Nice in-depth article !  You follow so many great companies.maybe you can make a Top 10 list regardless of price.Everything is expensive now,2024-10-05

"One of my favorite companies that's always expensive, but I have to agree with you that it's getting to the top of the range, even for them.",2024-10-04
I've waited 3+ years for ATH again. I feel perfectly fine with my TTD investment since 2017.It's also interesting how quietly and rather slowly it moved to ATH lol.,2024-10-04

52w high now. I hope the fed has some good news. ,2024-09-18
"@Gadzman_33 - I'm glad you see how TTD is unique, and that's the reason it was never a cheap stock. I put Crwd and even Shop in same category.But I recall you liked Nvta. To me it was obv loser. Genetic testing a commodity. And they were a money loser. And the fact Ark owned it, confirmed it was dog. Like Edit Tdoc etc. Btw I liked Flgt at that time, which I bought in 20s and sold 150s.",2024-09-17
"@bonanzzzer we'll have to see. To my paid subscribers, I immediately said I thought this was unlikely but there could be some form of UID2.0 version specifically adapted to CTV or something like that. So, not a Roku competitor, more of an add-on.",2024-09-15
@Gadzman_33 I’ve owned it since January 2019 at basis of $13.30 and have never sold a share of the many shares I own. Jeff Green is an outstanding CEO and founded the company to ALWAYS be profitable which he has done masterfully. It is a cornerstone in my portfolio. Many more opportunities and growth in the future!,2024-09-14
Investors will seriously regret not owning the Trade Desk in the next 5-10 years!!  I'm  staying long,2024-09-13
"Long from $34 , plan on holding 10 years +",2024-09-13
"Trade Desk price target raised to $115 from $110 at Wedbush Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt raised the firm's price target on Trade Desk to $115 from $110 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. Estimates for total U.S. political spending growth are in the mid-teens range versus the 2020 election cycle, and the firm expects CTV political spending will increase at a significantly faster pace and assume base case CTV political growth of +40% versus 2020, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm's findings suggest over $50M of 2H24 political revenue for Trade Desk, the analyst says.",2024-09-13
impressive to see that from so far out ... am also long however my cost basis is nowhere near as cheap as what you got in at. Well done!,2024-09-13

"@Mongea I disagree it’s sounds like a joint engineering effort. Sources told Lowpass that Trade Desk will supply Sonos with the core smart TV OS and help facilitate deals with app publishers, while Sonos is designing its own hardware and customizing the user interface.The operative word is Sonos is designing its “own” hardware. Also trade desk as of now is not in the consumer electronics business at all. Sonos puts them there.",2024-09-12
@NYSJ agree.  There can't be much more downside at 0.8x lowered sales!!!  Not sure what Trade desk gets from this besides partnering with a formerly good brand.  My hunch is Sonos is footing this bill.,2024-09-12
@Alex Pitti likewise. I still like Sonos and think there is upside from here .,2024-09-12
Turned out to be fake news.  TTD CEO said so today that there is no TVOS in their roadmap.  Amazing that even an institution like Citi based their analysis on a no-name blog post.  Cant believe that it went through Citi's internal review process and was allowed to be posted.,2024-09-11
