"@Ivo Kolchev Liquidation should have been higher than $21 for common shareholders, but the company's executives paid themselves and their employees obscene amounts of salaries/G&A over the last 3+ years.",2024-09-20
"@GrayhawkAZ yup it is available here d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/... though they estimate $19.30-21.00/share which seems low, anyhow good luck",2024-09-20

"@mktcrusher_6600 The $18 is probably a return of capital dividend if they follow the plan as laid out. My question is do the sell the remaining 4 buildings at firesale prices, as office buildings are currently receiving low bids everywhere. If not do they merge the remaining assets with a high quality REIT and issue new shares and/or cash to complete the liquidation or do they spin the remaining assets off into a new REIT.",2024-09-14
@lacunaround thank you for the reply. Does this mean they might pay $18 dividend and then the leftover $2.5/ share (20.5-18) upon winding down! Or is it $18 in 2024 and then liquidation of $20.5 in 2025 !,2024-09-14
