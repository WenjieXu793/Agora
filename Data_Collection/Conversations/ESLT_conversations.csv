"I agree broadly with the upgrade. At the same time, I'd like to see more analysis of the company's future prospects and the stock's valuation. Questions: 1. Is there really short term risk from the Iran-Israel conflict ending? After the US arms freeze / embargoe on weapons shipments to Israel, Israeli government ministers have stated publicly that Israel is over-reliant on the US for munitions and key armaments, and needs to build a stronger military supply chain. It's also likely that Israel will spend more on defense for the foreseeable future. Maybe Elbit will benefit from this over a multi year period, irrespective of how soon the Iran + Iranian proxies / Israel conflict lasts for. With increased military spending and investment in the military supply chain by Israel in the next few years, Elbit Systems may face no risk of a cooldown in near-term demand from Israel, even if there is de-escalation in the region.2. Will Elbit benefit from growing global defense spending and purchase of munitions? With the war in Ukraine and the Iranian proxies war against Israel, there's a growing realization that Western democracies have insufficient production capacity for weapons and munitions. At the same time, Western countries are increasing their defense spending due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the Iran + Iranian proxies/Israel conflict, and the risk of a China/Taiwan conflict. Will Elbit benefit from increased military spending by Western democracies and other countries like India? 3. How competitive are Elbit's products? Elbit's products are being tested and improved in real time in the Iran-Israel war. Its development cycles are much faster than the large US defense companies. It also has a successful drone product line, and demand for drones is rocketing (no pun intended). How competitive are its products?4. How attractive is $ESLT's valuation? Elbit is trading at a forward non-GAAP P/E of 25, with a projected forward revenue growth rate of only 8.8%. I'm personally interested in this stock (it's in my ""watch"" list), but it's currently too expensive.5. How does $ESLT's valuation compare to that of other defense stocks? The Seeking Alpha quant system gives $ESLT a ""D+"" grade for Valuation by comparing it to the stocks in the entire Industrials sector.  See: seekingalpha.com/... However it might be more useful to compare Elbit more narrowly to other defense stocks. How does $ESLT's valuation compare to that of other defense stocks?",2024-09-23
