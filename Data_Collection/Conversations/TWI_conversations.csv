"TWI does well in the wheel business with OEM’s.  The biggest concern is with the OEM tire business where Trelleborg/Mitas has made inroads with Deere and other OEM’s. Carlstar acquisition is a stretch since TWI does very little in consumer areas. Knowing the penny pinching in Quincy, TWI will probably screw up the acquisition.",2024-08-28
@Andrew Paterson I own both SEB and TWI. Titan is a play on a soft landing or no landing scenario. SEB is more of a long-term food inflation idea available on the cheap today.,2024-08-23
@SPC2 Gross margins are close to Goodyear. Final margins at Titan are now better on reduced debt load.,2024-08-23
"Gross margin fluctuates between 10-20%.  Either an unattractive market or a poor operator.  Probably both. Fine for a cyclical play, but not a quality company in its current form.",2024-08-22
