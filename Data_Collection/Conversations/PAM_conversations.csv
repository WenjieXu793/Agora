@Quipus Capital so why is the stock appreciating? Just Main Street investors buying? Or quite possible much smarter wealthier folks/institutions with more inside knowledge feel itâ€™s undervalued?,2024-09-07
"@Justinthyme Yes, it's fair, but I would add two things:1- If that is the thesis then it is a much more speculative thesis on Argentinian politics and macro. It's not the same as buying an undervalued business because of its operations. 2- You can also buy businesses that have the Argentinian upside, but also much bigger growth opportunities and that are less tied to political or macroeconomic winds and trade more cheaply. For example, $VIST.",2024-08-27
