"I can certainly see the appeal of POST, which has out-performed other packaged goods/food products companies KHC, CAG, TSN and CPB over the past year. Even so, POST still trades at a lower Price/Cash Flow ratio than each of the others. Accordingly, you have identified a good investment candidate.However, if I were to choose between KHC or POST at their current prices, I would choose KHC. It's a larger company with more visibility, a dividend yield of almost 5% while POST pays nothing, and more upside potential in the eyes of CFRA.While the Price/Cash Flow and p/e ratios of KHC and POST are very close, the FORWARD p/e ratio of KHC is half that of POST, and KHC has a debt/equity ratio that is not only more palatable to me but also only 25% of the debt/equity ratio of POST.",2024-10-03
