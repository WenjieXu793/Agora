"@quickmio @quickmio I know yhet Qualcomm wants to borrow certain x86 ""microcode"" or whatever to mix with their Snapdragons to get the edge over the clone pack.Anotehr reason I think why Qualcomm is interested in Intel as whole or for the chip design division is that Qualcomm probably plan to develop Windows smartphones.  20 years ago  , x86 was too cumbersome and power hogging to use in personal digital assistants, (remember PDAs?).  Arm chips were power efficieint but not that powerful back then.  We pushed on  and Androids came . ARM exploded.Back then, we had 180 nm nodes     very weak chips   during the days of Pentium...  . ARMs were laughingstocks back then.Intel ignored smartphones but this doesnt mean Intel will never come back ot smartphones or PDAs  . We can forget PDAs.The reason for Windows phones is better connections wtih PCs that is not going to go away ..I have frustrations with my Androids working with my PCS for decades.I think Androids are just lame.Apple phones works well with Macs, dont they?  take a hint.. will ya?Intel and Qualcomm will merge and kick all the fabless Android clones out in the orbit with Elon Musk's satellites.",2024-10-05
"@RUBYRUBY3 TSMC $750 billion  Intel will catch upIntel merged with Qualcomm will kill off all ARM clones .nothing anti trust investigations can do about it.Apple, NVDIA Broadcom  AMD will be forced to build own fabs to stay competitve with Intel Qualcomm",2024-10-02
@OilIsDEAD Without FABs just stop and think about this.Apple Inc. (AAPL): $3.46 trillionNVIDIA Corp (NVDA): $2.98 trillionBroadcom Inc. (AVGO): $822.62 billionAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD): $266 billionQualcomm Inc. (QCOM): $189.52 billionWith FABsIntel Corp (INTC): $97.92 billionOne of these things is not like the others:,2024-10-02
@webchow I have seen it. While there is some truth behind it I still think is more of Qualcomm generating not enough revenue to sustain the acquisition,2024-10-02
"@webchow Missing the point if you have a good product with your IP and you improve it by wrapping it in another companies IP you can't be free of them and then they control your product.AMD reverse engineered the INTC chip still tied to INTC over that.AMD came up with 64 bit INTC had to license it, did not stop them from jerking AMD around for a decade.Handing INTC AMD's marketing plan and amount of production with release dates would be a disaster.",2024-10-02
"@RUBYRUBY3 Patents are Patents. Intel can reverse engineer anything. There's nothing that could be learned in manufacturing that couldn't be learned in the engineering department. As long as agreements are in place, there is nothing wrong with intel manufacturing anyone's chips. There's nothing else to understand.",2024-10-01

"@OilIsDEAD Intel has been actively investing in high-NA EUV lithography machines from ASML. They have secured several of these advanced machines for their production needs. However, the exact number of high-NA EUV machines Intel will have by 2026 is not explicitly stated in the available information.Intel is expected to use these machines for their 14A process technology, which is anticipated to be in production around 2026. Given their significant investment and strategic plans, itâ€™s possible that Intel could have a substantial number of high-NA EUV machines by then, but the precise number, such as 12, is not confirmed.",2024-10-01
"@OilIsDEAD ""TSMC have to ration to other fabless chip makers like AMD AWS, Mediatek, Apple, et etc and are swamped already.""They have several companies buying the blocks they need for targeted markets, more than a year in advance. This what a successful IFS looks like.Let me know when INTC is swamped so far just like last IFS failed attempt nothing is going on in the swamped department.If I can't talk you out of it mortgage the house and buy INTC hard, best way to learn the price of dreams.

INTC 18a will be near the same in performance TSMC history says it delivers. 18A who knows if volume will be there.,2024-10-01
"@RUBYRUBY3 From tehre, I can gauge that Qualcomm can dominate IFS services for making Snapdragons while Intel makes x86 as usual after merger.No other fabless ARM clones will gain access to IFS if ever. They had their opportunities for several years and they blew it.Or at least Quaclomm will get the first serve at IFS .. if there is still spare capacity then who knows.. Mediatek can scrap a few chps there.",2024-10-01
@RUBYRUBY3 there is no knowin gtill Qualcomm show Intel their wallet and Intel might find Qualcomm offer acceptable  . I am sure that Intel will accept only if taken over as whole not cherry picks.,2024-10-01
"@vortex generator costly to produce, sold cheap, at a loss.  Just like with solar and battery.",2024-10-01
@RUBYRUBY3 Qualcomm sells more than one model of chip.  They might look forward to being able to sell a significantly differentiated higher tier and lower tier chip and benefit from better market segmentation.  They would also happily pay a premium for 50 or 100 million halo chips to better challenge Apple in the mobile space.,2024-10-01
@RUBYRUBY3 Why?   this is the least of my concerns..  AMD is always welcome no matter what!AMD gave up on their GPU because they decide to prioritize their x86 chps to be made at TSMC as it is limited  in availabilty. AMD could have gained on Intel in x86 had AMD used IFS services . Their loss .AMD can afford to build their own fabs now if they wish to..,2024-10-01
"@quickmio Qualcomm has not generated enough revenues because Qualcomm cannot get more Snapdragons produced at TSMC.  TSMC have to ration to other fabless chip makers like AMD AWS, Mediatek, Apple, et etc and are swmped already. Microsoft chose to work with Qualcomm to develop chips for Windows laptops    Quaclomm laptops have better battery life than x86 laptops by both Intel and AMD.  Laptop market is huge and Qualcomm can fill there.intel will continiue to make x86 for heavy crunchers along with Snapdragons.It is up to Intel Qualcomm to offer IFS services to anyone fabless if there is still spare capacity. With AI  everyhwere , ther e is no knowing where chips will go .At least, Intel Qualcomm will use much of existing fab capacity and future ones and I am sure ther eiwll be spare capacity left for IFS services . Whoever are interested can sign up.  But knowing Intel , they would prefer to stick to their knittings and will try to dominate the ARM chip after merger.I dont think ther eiwlll be any anti trust matters there after all, Intel had been offering IFS services and no takers  except Microsoft. Those fabless ARM chp makers will have no case against Intel Qualcomm merger.Had they used IFS services already in the past, then they have the case..  They got  nothing .",2024-10-01
@RUBYRUBY3 Intel planned to receive 12 high NA EUV equipments through end of 2026.  Did you forget to multiiply by 12?  It took years for Qualcomm to build 3 biliion Snapdragons.  what is annual quantity? I dont worry about Intel's capacity.,2024-10-01
"@RUBYRUBY3 Intel sticked to old DUV equipment all way till Intel 7 before throwing in the towel and started buying low NA EUV only for Ireland fabs to make Intel 3 /4. Oregon fabs have the high NA EUV now. I dont  know about Arizona  but Intel is builidng a new fab there and I am sure high NA EUV wil be put there. Intel is building new fabs in Ohio and  same thing with high NA there. Europe fabs and israeli fabs are suspended till later.We dont really need Apple  , they ar just toys.",2024-10-01
