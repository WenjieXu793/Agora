"@Sorengard $S doesn't trade at a premium valuation, only $PANW and $CRWD despite their problems. seekingalpha.com/...",2024-10-01
"@Henry Miles Really? Guess the $S CEOs are ok with intrusions, hence the lower stock multiple, but faster growth.",2024-10-01

"I hold PANW and I don't disagree with this thesis. In fact, I'd love for the stock to correct  ~25% from current levels as I sold deep ITM covered calls and value the stock at ~$250.  The problem is that, for now, this space commands such a premium multiple and it's pretty much a 2.5 horse race with PANW, S &...CRWD.",2024-10-01

I sold $PANW last week. I have the impression it has reached its peak for the time being. But I will be keeping a critical eye on $PAWN's further development.,2024-09-28
"Very interesting position, but I'll hold on for a while longer. Too much trading cuts gains short and helps reduce the federal deficit.",2024-09-27
