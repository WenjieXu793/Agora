"@Leo Nelissen congrats on basically bottom ticking this one in the mid $140, with your last article in April.  Morningstar should stick to watching Mutual Funds.",2024-09-27
@author is that 8 - 10% for next few years or 8 - 10% over the long term?  If 8 - 10% over long term that isnt anything great....,2024-09-26
"@ndardick I appreciate that data. In general, I noticed Morningstar is often very ""bearish"" on stocks. Almost always, they have the lowest ratings.",2024-09-26
"Thanks for the ZTS update, Leo.  My wife and I purchased shares shortly after the split-off from PFE, and still have them.  It has never seemed cheap enough (at the times that I had money to invest), and so I havenâ€™t purchased more other than the shares received through dividend reinvestment.  It has been a great ride, and I look forward to the next 11 years.",2024-09-26
"Once again, Leo, this is a stock that highlights our different situations and investment strategies. ZTS should work for someone at your young age but not for a septuagenarian such as myself. You say: ""All things considered, for dividend investors seeking dividend growth, Zoetis offers a very compelling mix of stability and upside potential."" Yet, you acknowledge that the current dividend yield under 1% is low, and I assert that the p/e ratio is not a bargain. So, I am not a buyer of ZTS.However, in large part because of your prior research, I bought ZTS attractively for my 3 granddaughters on December 27, 2022, at a favorable price of $144.45, as a tribute to their favorite cat who had to be put to sleep on Christmas Eve. At a current price of $194, they have done well thus far.Please don't shoot the messenger, but I feel constrained to share the fact that Morningstar has a Fair Value Assessment of only $170 for ZTS, and CFRA has a 12-month price target of only $171.",2024-09-26
