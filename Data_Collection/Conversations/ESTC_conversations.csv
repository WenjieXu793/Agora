"Guggenheim agrees with a major 73 page analyst report issued on  September 10 saying:: We’re initiating coverage of Elastic N.V. with a Buy Rating and $100 pricetarget, implying 39% potential upside. Elastic is best known as the leading enterprise search engine, enabling highly relevant results across corporate websites to product catalogs, and even powers the tech stacks of some competitors. Over the last decade,Elastic has extended its core strength—indexing and searching through vast amountsof unstructured data—into other adjacent use cases, including observability and security (SIEM and EDR). More recently, Elastic has launched solutions that provide a unique foundation for the creation of GenAI applications. Serendipitously, the GenAI market came to them, and should provide sustainable tailwinds, even if the anticipated near-term benefit is overblown. Despite promising evidence of early platform adoption for GenAIuse cases and increasing wallet share in observability and SIEM, revenue growth has decelerated significantly in recent years, and what was once significant outperformance vs. weighted average underlying market growth is no longer. We believe ongoing GTM challenges have been the main culprit, most recently evidenced in the lowering of FY25 revenue growth from 16% to 14% due to disruption from a sales segmentation change to better target large accounts (though op. margin was raised to 12.5% with FCF margin slightly higher). ESTC shares have reacted accordingly and now trade at 5.1x EV/NTMRec Rev (and 4.4x EV/FY26 Total Rev), below the NPV of its recurring revenue if itwas run hyper-efficiently and never grew (or declined). Our model indicates reset FY25 guidance is prudent with room for upside, while our analysis of Elastic’s revenue mix and relative growth rates support at least a mid-teens CAGR with potential for re-acceleration, supporting positive risk/reward for ESTC shares.",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"Great write-up, @Bert Hochfeld !I’ve been long ESTC several years (former insider).On the GenAI question, they discussed some of the customer mechanics on the Q4 earnings call, and that explanation of customer mechanics sounded an awful lot like their shift from on-premise to cloud… So, if I were modeling rev, I’d use a rev ramp curve similar to that for the shape of the curve, but magnitude of rev is anyone’s guess based on per-customer ACV+consumption assumptions.What we saw on cloud specifically was that a bunch of customers signed up (or didn’t commit to contracts and just began consuming), but the ACV dynamics were way different than the on-prem node-based motion, where a customer signed for X nodes on a longer term basis (traditional SaaS license model). So, we saw many customers adopting, but we considered it “planting many smaller seeds” vs the old on-premise model. This also threw off internal modeling (and Wall St) as consumption is more challenging to model vs booking SaaS licenses. I think we’re seeing the same in GenAI, as customers build out use-cases in unpredictable ways.Valuation is right, IMO. If I weren’t already in a big position, I’d buy more in the low-$70’s for a long term “AI pics and shovels” + “big data” themed play.",2024-09-21 00:00:00.000000

"Does Barry the ceo of PSEC have to buy more shares every single day???? He was rude to the shareolders at the Conf call and even though the news was good - he gave many shareholders attitude.  I can whine cause i bought a bunch at $4.75-85 but I planned on buying even more.  Everytime I set a price Barry comes in and buys more and literally millions.  This guy is something else, not sure I've seen anything like it in over 50 years of investing.  I'd love to be able to call him and ask if he plans to stop but I over-react to rude people.",2024-09-12 00:00:00.000000
I think this company has a lot of potential. I'm surprised it's not doing better. Seems very oversold.,2024-09-11 00:00:00.000000
@RealRural QQQJ maybe?  Index fund though and newer so performance isn't that impressive yet.,2024-09-10 00:00:00.000000

"Good ideas and theory on this press release, but way too much research for this ancient investor. Anyone have recommendations if there is/are mid-cap tech ETFs or CEFs to look at? I'd be happy to get decent performance with diversified tech risk from a mid cap fund.",2024-09-10 00:00:00.000000
"I actually see quite a few solid companies here with share prices that should appreciate considerably, if not immediately. Some names I don't recognize and a few I find questionable but overall not a bad list to generate some ideas for further research.Mid-caps are something my portfolio needs desparately and I would like to open ~5 positions in a few new stocks over the coming weeks (usually 1/4th to 1/3rd the size of what I consider a full position). I'd like at least 3 to be mid-caps. I'm really eyeing TER, but my portfolio is already considerably overweight in the semiconductor industry.",2024-09-10 00:00:00.000000
