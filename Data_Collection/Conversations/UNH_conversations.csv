@Orangejulius If all their competition is having the same problem a solution and or not much of a loss in policies might happen.,2024-10-04
"@dondougie Maybe. Humana's issue isn't just the star ratings, it's their degrading level of service. It's causing providers to reject their insurance, and businesses to flee to UNH / ELV and alternatives.",2024-10-04
"This might be good for HUM. UnitedHealthcare (NYSE:UNH) has become the latest to legally challenge the Medicare Advantage Star Ratings system, which allows health insurers to receive bonus payments from the government.The lawsuit filed by a group of UnitedHealth (UNH) subsidiaries in a Texas district court on Monday alleged that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) unfairly downgraded the insurer's Star Ratings.According to Bloomberg News, which first reported the lawsuits, the UNH units accused CMS of downgrading the company's Star Ratings based on an ""arbitrary and capricious assessment"" of one phone call that lasted less than 10 minutes...",2024-10-04

This is where the world must step in. Introduce a DRUG AFFORDIBILITY ACT. Maybe this is where India and China step in. Makes product affordable in India and also increases medical and pharma tourism.Allow companies to manufacture drugs on patent as follows.Pay 50% of sales price to the company holding the patent for the first year of patent coverage after first drug introduced to market.45% for year 240% for year 335% for year 430% for year 5 25% for year 6 to 820% for year 9 to 1510% until the expiry of patent,2024-09-24

"@SuperPac It's your prerogative to be concerned, but if you want to be invested in the healthcare industry, it's a risk across all major public companies, for the most part. We think UNH is best positioned to navigate best.",2024-09-18
"Biosimilars of Humira (adalimumab), such as Simlandi and Amjevita, share many of the same side effects as Humira, but some biosimilars may have unique or more pronounced side effects due to slight variations in formulation.One notable difference is that biosimilars like Simlandi have been reported to carry a potentially higher risk of specific infections or immune reactions compared to Humira. For instance, Simlandi has been associated with an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome and multiple sclerosis, which are neurological conditions not commonly emphasized in the side effects of Humira itself.",2024-09-18
"@PropNotes I am concerned. In an increasingly centrally planned, centrally directed and centrally price-controlled (margin-managed) business, your risk capital is no longer merely adjusting to market forces, but it's being pushed around politically. That impacts product / services offering, their design and delivery and their cost and pricing. Unhealthy outcome from a shareholder standpoint. $UNH and $ELV will underperform S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 in the foreseeable future in all likelihood. (This is beyond boomer gen.)",2024-09-17
"@SuperPac True to some degree, but this seems overstated. All policies have been aimed at playcating boomers, which means that medicare and medicaid will be priorities if and when they're making budget decisions. We're not concerned broadly.",2024-09-17
$UNH is exposed to political policy risks that are hard to model and quantify. We can call these risks ''regulatory risks'' but in essence these are political risks which are more difficult to tackle than some peripheral changes in bureaucratic regulation. The market knows this and is capping the upside on $UNH. I like their business but I am quite uncertain about their future margins and operational flexibility in the market place. The political-ideological landscape in the USA has changed quite dramatically over the last 12 - 15 years making the future of the likes of $UNH and $ELV harder to get a grip on.,2024-09-17
"There are a lot of advantageous reasons to continue to rely on the market leader.UnitedHealth has demonstrated consistent revenue and earnings growth over the past five years, driven by its diversified healthcare service offerings and strong market presence. The company has successfully adapted to changing industry dynamics, including an increasing demand for healthcare services, which positions it well for future growth. Its commitment to innovation and technology integration, such as telehealth services, enhances operational efficiency and customer engagement. Furthermore, favorable regulatory trends and an expanding insured population provide a supportive environment for sustained growth. Lastly, the company's strong financial metrics and solid management execution contribute to a high likelihood of maintaining growth momentum over the next five years.That pays off very well.Unitedhealth's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 15.2% ranks in the 95.6% percentile for the sector.The stock is good value based on its 5y PEGY ratio of 1.37 and that still makes the stock appear very buyable.The price increase to date is firmly underpinned by fundamentals.Long $UNHPrice and value quality are almost on the same level here.In other words, if you don't already own the stock, you should think hard about changing this disadvantageous state.",2024-09-17
I wonder why health insurance costs are going up? ,2024-09-16
"United Healthcare is threatened by  individual member lawsuits and multiple government inquiries/legal actions into its business practices.  Both United Healthcare and Optum are ethically and morally challenged.  They have both had site revues of their practices and failed the test.  In several instances they produced docs of good faith but never demonstrated progress.  They've lost contracts with several states, counties and communities in the USA.  Good thing they don't have presidential immunity.  Greed is king...screw you health.",2024-09-13
"From what I understand, Humana is exiting something like 13 counties in Medicare coverage. There’s other companies abandoning other areas. Have you considered that in regards to your growth scenario.",2024-09-13

"@Ray Merola perhaps at the federal level but I worry more about the state level, momentum seems to be increasing. If nothing else the patchwork of PBM laws will lower margins from managing compliance",2024-09-12
It’s a best in breed business but it’s starting to look expensive if you’re not totally sold on managements forward guidance. The bar they’ve set seems pretty optimistic but then again they’ve beaten pretty much every time the last few years.Also PBM under a microscope by legislatures gives me pause. As a long time holder of the stock both of those things right now have the stock as a hold to me. If it advances much more I might start trimming shares,2024-09-12
"OptumRx has operating margins in the 4 percent range as does peer CVS' Pharmacy segment.  While we agree UnitedHealth Group stock appears Fair Value, I think a lot of the PBM rumblings will fade away after the election cycle.  This has been the pattern in past years.",2024-09-12
