"This dental industry is a racket like the whole medical industry.  Is there any stock you guys know of that is related to periodontal disease?  Some therapeutic company or something working on a cure?I have periodontal disease with over 50% of the country in my demographic.  Why can't they find a cure with stem cell research or something.  Annoying!  I have to come up with $8,400 next month for a one-time, non-invasive laser surgery to build up my gums a little and sterilize the bacteria deep in the roots.  Not a cure.  All 4 quadrants in one shot, and I'm not even going to take a sedative or go under anesthesia for the 4-hour procedure to save money.  And I don't want to tap into any brokerage I have.  I do have the cash in savings, but that messes up my savings goal for the year.  Useless HSA Aetna dental insurance only covers a max of $2000 a year for dental expenses.  So that brings it down to $6,400. I have $4,300 in my HSA acct. (Health Care Savings Account) which I totally forgot about. That's a nice surprise and I'll use 100% of that.  Heck, medical has a cap of $6,000 per year out of pocket but dental insurance in this country is horrible it seems.  Standard dental insurance has no out of pocket cap.  Just a max amount of yearly usage of $2,000 max, which is puny.  That leaves me about $2,000 short.  Which I'll have to pull out of my checking acct/savings, messing up my goal to have $15,000 saved up per year.  Or at least jeopardizing that goal and not leaving me much of a cushion if I take all that out and put it in my Wells Brokerage.I'm so annoyed.  I'd rather invest that money.  You can't even borrow against the HSA acct.  I looked.  There should be a zero-interest loan option if used for dental necessities.  :)  Seriously!I hate our racket of fleecing patients in America and the toxic politics of affordable health care as people vote against themselves.  Other countries have it much better.   So irritating.Thanks for letting me vent.  For real, if someone knows a periodontal investment somewhere that's liquid, let me know.  I want a cure for my one and only ailment.  Because I want to keep my teeth for life.  And I have to see the dang dentist 4 times a year for life it seems.  As I have been the last ten years.  Geez!  Annoying!  Oh, I know. I should donate my plasma at one of those plasma farms if I can get at least $800 for a month of donations.  Not for free, that's for sure.  IFF I can do that, I can get my out-of-checkbook to $1,200ish...",2024-09-26
"Itâ€™s surprising that the ROIC is so low.    This should be a high margin and returns business; something is holding back returns - the need to push marketing spend, convince dentists and orthos that make more with braces, lowering prices as consumers have resisted .. Management should level with investors",2024-09-17
