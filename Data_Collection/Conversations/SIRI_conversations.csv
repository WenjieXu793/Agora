"@mfoss it’s the same story everytime…if you see the stock falling you can’t handle it. You let the market guide you, I will use my brain. You just don’t understand their model, you can’t answer why their churn has actually improved despite the competition and this has been going on for years. The market always overreacts to the downside because it consists mostly of people like you that can’t think for themselves. Their free cash flow would have to get sliced in half to prove your point, ain’t gonna happen. Margin of safety? Do you even understand what a 5 multiple is? It’s a multiple reserved for terrible businesses or ones that are falling apart and easy to see they are falling apart. You talk as if you are already proven right simply because the stock is down. Instead of continuing to talk, let’s compare portfolios and returns and let’s put a nice wager to make it worth my time. That will shut you up for good, I guarantee it.",2024-10-08 10:47:20.027282
@HoodWinkCapital Brk buying out Siri and paying off the debt would be good,2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"@arctic sapiens I’m not sure “facing strong headwinds “ is an accurate way to describe them because they also have some strong tailwinds. Remember also, churn is a very important number to monitor what everyone has been saying for years. And that number has actually improved. I’m not suggesting they absolutely haven’t lost some of their advantages but saying strong headwinds without supporting data is most likely not accurate. And please don’t give me a few quarters of weakness, and extrapolate that way into the future as permanent. Thats called speculation. I had these same type of conversations so many times about other businesses that had a few years of weakness but no real change to their most. Baba was the last one ….think all the bears that were certain the govt would kill babas business one way or another, scrambled away like ants when the very thing they were so sure about has now come to the rescue. I will again cover myself by saying the fat lady hasn’t  even gargled yet with Baba but it certainly seems like Baba is well positioned now that the govt is going to lift consumer spend, using a lot of different tools. I would say at least 8/10 stocks where everyone can see they are trading for very cheap multiples of fcf but because the STOCK hasn’t worked for a few years they must be in trouble, where the stock went on to recover with very good -great returns because that’s what happens with a 6 p/e on a good business that’s struggling rather than being disrupted.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@Nichalyssa dude thanks for the basic finance 101 theory.  The problem with your theory is this isn’t a great biz that’s just been LBO’d.  It’s a biz that’s starting to fade with a growing and sizable debt level.  You will be right only if they start turning this around. Mgt is in a tough spot.  They are pitching a capital intensive service, 360L, when they need to spend marketing $ on he app. They’ve been walking naive equity investors down on capex/fcf.  They keep finding new things to use the OCF for.  This is why the stock has been hammered. Leverage + fcf both going the wrong way.  It’s a simple, bad situation that’s not so simple to fix. Btw his name was Michael Milken. You’re welcome.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@mfoss you are straight up wrong because he is giving you facts along with his narrative. And that’s the problem here, you don’t seem to understand that what he is suggesting is not Gordon Gecko. During the 8o’s they were doing LBO’s with very little equity and selling off parts quickly and laying off people to make it work. And guess what? It worked extremely well in a lot of cases despite paying high interest rates a la the king of junk bonds Mike Milton I believe was his name. a big difference from what Pablo is saying, 2 totally different ways to increase returns. And he definitely is talking about real world value creation because you pay less cash taxes and if you use the low cost debt to buy back shares that are yielding more  than the after tax cost of debt, well that’s basically text book value creation.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@Pablo Linguist hey I completely agree with you, debt well structured in a very favourable rate environment, long dated maturities in a subscription business is unlikely to cause issues. I stated in another thread that in 2012 or so DTV hired Mike white and his financial playbook was simple yet very lucrative. They were debt free and interest rates were low and the business was regularly printing 12% growth in Ebitda. People were nervous because they had no real broadband solution and eventually that was going to be an issue. Anyway it didn’t take a genius to figure out how much debt they would borrow (3 times Ebitda) and they gave a rough timeframe combined with Ebitda growth it was simple to see they would compound fcf per share by 35% a year for 3 years and then continue buying with less debt but still with cash flow. It was easy pickings and it was the first of 2 stocks where I put 40% of net worth in it. I remember once spending hours trying to isolate how much of the net value creation came just from the debt. Another interesting thing I learned is that a buyback on top of Ebitda growth produces a compounding effect that produced another 2-3% growth over and above what simple math would have indicated. And lastly, during that period  of pretty intense study, I learned that cable was is a very enviable position once broadband became an esssential service. So Charter because the second stock with 40% of net worth at 285 late 2018 I believe. Clearly I would have made a killing when it hit 800 and I did sell quite a bit of it as the portfolio was drowning in Charters relative value but I felt invincible and didn’t sell it all like I would have a few years earlier. I ended up giving back half of my Charter gains and half was a BIG number",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@mfoss what part?However I am not your unpaid research assistant- On debt: No maturities until 2026- 100 million a quarter in interest expense with 700 million in EBITDA- so no liquidity issues, after that the bonds mature at roughly 1.5 billion per year which can be paid off fully with free cash flow or rolled over On revenue: 33 million subs with low churn- stable cash flow. On valuation:It is valued at 7x EBITDA or has FCF yield in the double digits. Spotify has market cap of 75 billion as comparison and earns far less money Margin of safety… what multiple do you think Siri should trade at and why- be specific.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
@Pablo Linguist please inform us as to Siri’s margin of safety?? Be specific.,2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@mfoss which is why you have a margin of safety, which compensates for it. The debt is serviceable in any reasonable foreseeable future.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
@mfoss that you think that- marks you as a rube. The idea that manageable debt isn’t a good thing is laughable. Anyone with a Calculator and nothing more than 8th grade math can figure out if debt will be a problem. In the case of Siri - it won’t.,2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
"As others have said, it's easy to call them and negotiate the price down every year. I've had SXM for a little over 2 years, and negotiated twice for a yearly deal that gives me the ~$20 plan for under $8 a month.I like many of the channels, (particularly news channels) so I'll continue renewing as long as the monthly cost is under $10. It doesnt run up my mobile data when I listen in the car, and it basically works everywhere I go. I also frequently use the web app and mobile apps, so I feel the cost is reasonable.The stock however... yeah, I don't know. I feel like younger people will just go with Spotify, Apple or Amazon Music, and stream from their phone over Bluetooth, or use native infotainment apps.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
"@Nichalyssa the concern and focus on debt shows a lack of financial acumen. Debt that is manageable and structured correctly amplifies returns on invested capital- the same way a mortgage amplifies your return on your house. In addition the tax benefit runs about 15% or so on the earned income of the business. If you use debt to buy back shares, and then you lower your taxes through the payment of interest the returns are even greater. Debt is good for a well run business",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"by the time it reaches $15 it won't be at $1b fcf. That is the risk. Also, the 10.5 billion in debt is so large that in effect what we are saying is that the equity could be very small or wiped out. already the firm has a negative equity of 2 billion. Who in their right mind runs a company so aggressively with huge debt and no equity and the risk of fcf decline? I wouldn't. As I mentioned before this seems to be mostly a bet on unexpected high inflation. While that bet might pan out, it seems imprudent if you believe in investing as opposed to speculating. I used to own a stock where the management was highly leveraged to inflation that never came - needless to say they didn't do very well. They wasted lots of time and maybe they will be right on doomsday or something but slow and steady gains seem a better idea.",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@Nichalyssa They clearly stated their primary use of FCF is to pay down debt, most likely for the next year or 2.  I mention that as a pragmatic point.  Anyone can make assumptions like yours above, and get a big stock price.  But as is plainly evident, the biz is decidedly NOT stable, with sub losses, ARPU slowing, and extra 1-time uses of FCF.  Why don't you practice this exercise:  Ask yourself what are EQUITY holders worried about to create such a low equity valuation (pick your metric)?  The point you neglect by excluding EV analysis is that it doesn't take a very big change in revenue and earnings to create a big decline in equity valution when there's signficant debt on the BS, especially when the prior assumption by investors was that of a stable business (when the debt was acquired).  Last, Finance 101 always teaches to value the business first, then value the debt and the equity.  Shortcuts that ignore this will get you in trouble.",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@bluescorpion0 it produces over $1bn in FCF right now sitting still, at $15 that would be a market cap of $5bn...not sure if you know how insanely cheap something is to be trading at less than 5xs FCF. Your ""feelings"" value",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@mfoss if they choose to pay down debt, what happens? You EV guys should have this down pat. Risk falls, equity multiple increases. Don’t shoot the messenger, I don’t make this stuff up.",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@arctic sapiens ev gives a better reflection of what when you have “high debt”?  You are talking past me or misunderstanding what I said. I’m not talking about the quality of the business or what the business returns on total capital when I say fcf yield. The business could be crap but trading at 2 times earnings averaged over the last 3 years and they are paying 10% interest on debt. So you tel me what ev tells you about your fcf yield?  ZERO!! If the earnings averaged over rolling 3 year intervals is steady, your fcf yield is 50% with a constant multiple. EV will not change that nor will ROIC. I never said they were not important measures, but what are you measuring? I will tell you one thing you are not measuring is the very thing that my post was about. Ad hominem points, whatever that means…if it means you need to be corrected about a specific measure, give me all the points",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@arctic sapiens I don’t disagree with you about the importance of ev when there is high debt, it tells you things about the business you need to know. But if that debt does not cause problems, (ie structured well at low rates and extended maturities) it’s not giving you an accurate view of what equity yields will be. Roic is probably the most important standalone metric there is but the fact of the matter is that debt at low cost increases returns to equity and I have not seen one person acknowledge this fact. I will use all numbers for whatever they are worth or for specific things I am trying to measure or gain insight. Not all debt is created equal and different business models can handle more than others.  So I stand by what I said, I don’t average my returns with bond holders. Do you disagree? And I have no idea what your last sentence of  jiberish means. If you don’t like debt, then stay away from it but don’t misrepresent it. Yes it cuts both ways but frequently, again, when structured intelligently, it increases returns dramatically. I don’t see the problem with stating these facts. Debt is not supposed to offend you, it don’t care that you don’t like it or appreciate it. It’s up to the investor to decide whether it’s appropriate or not. You don’t see me going on boards criticizing businesses that have no debt. Just state the facts, there’s really nothing else to say. I did that but because people are offended by debt they get upset with facts. There nothing I can do about that.",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@Nichalyssa The point is simply that FCF Yield is a great measure, but for cos. with high debt, EV gives a better reflection. Like ROE vs. ROIC. There's no one measure that says everything. Each gives a different angle of view.You should re-read it. FCF $1B is for this year. We all know that. Not sure what's this ""out yourself"". This discussion is not going to be productive based on ad hominem points.",2024-09-29 00:00:00.000000
@Nichalyssa EV is used to value the business not the equity.  Often companies with high debt look cheap on equity valuations but not on EV valuations. In this case Siri still looks cheapish on EV.  Btw equity holders won’t see much of that fcf till the debt is paid down.  In the end no upward revaluation till the biz improves.,2024-09-29 00:00:00.000000
