"@bioland_888 agree with all you said. If I were a buy and hold investor, I'd agree with that too. But those macro headwinds are EXACTLY why whatever I own now, I don't really own it, I rent it. The alternative would be to just ""stay on the sidelines"" but I've spent the past 25 year turning market lemons into lemonade, and that potential (in the form of accepting shorter-term profits and not hanging in for vicious declines) is as good as I've seen it.Just my take. Thanks for reading and taking the time to comment.",2024-10-03
The consumer is tapped with CC debt rising to 2007 levels.  The job market is soft and HD is at ATHs.  Pass,2024-10-03
"@sdavid04191 both stores in my area have low traffic. I am so so glad and Lucky we crushed our remodels just before the inflation hit, and loaded off the outrageous 30 percent tag last year. They get you on the small stuff, door insulation strips, hardware, all the usual maintenance items.",2024-09-25
Sold a small portion of my HD today. Market is getting over heated.,2024-09-24
As I've posted before I have had several big projects pent up since Covid and am finally getting around to them.  My preference has found that LOW is usually lower of the 2 on prices and their in store people are most helpful.  I'm currently framing a huge new shed on a poured concrete base.  Much to my surprise I scored pressure treated 2 x 4's at under $4 at HD.  During Covid these things were more than double in price.  The problem is in the HD I bought these in help was hard 2 find.  There was only 1 checkout opened and the guy in front of me only had a door and a lot of framing lumber of varying sizes.  The woman cashier scanned each one and then maticulously measured each one and compared it to what scanned.  2 people in the store and one of them had to wait more than a half hour to check out.  Since time is money my cheap 2 x 4's cost me a lot more.  This has happened in this store too many times which is why I prefer the LOW next door.,2024-09-24

"""The firm's thesis is that lower interest rates following the FOMC action last week could help boost the stock.""     In theory I should look at my statement and see interest at say 9 percent, not 30?!  Boys in white shirts and suits in ivory towers obviously don't shop for nails and 2x4's.",2024-09-24
Love our Lowe's. As I've penned for a couple of years I could buy Lowe's all day. Greatly overweigthted in one of my wife's accounts - along with Berkshire.,2024-09-24
"Great analysis! As a shareholder since 97 and recent buyer at 280, and 350 I also see higher prices ahead. What people fail to realize is HD is one of the best performers all time and a great long term compounding investment.",2024-09-23
@bigfish1977 I know but a long time ago I researched LOW and HD.  It was when HD was having problems with Nardelli as CEO.  I picked LOW to start a position and I've added to it on dips.  HD eventually did get its act together.  Both are attractive.,2024-09-18

"@Consideration thank you for your kind ""consideration!"" I respect those who respect the work we do as analysts on this platform. So your comment stands out, and if you don't already follow SIP on SA, I invite you to do so.Yes, when I created a subscription service a year ago, as a former fiduciary investment advisor, I felt like if I'm going to ask someone to pay to subscribe, it should not simply be to ""what I think"" but also to what I'm doing. And that's something that during my advisory career, always frustrated me, that so many in that field did not have any type of skin in the game. Thanks again, enjoy!",2024-09-16
"@bzb711 good for you! Hard to argue with the ""going to be a blue chip long-term"" aspect of this one. I invite you to follow SIP on SA.",2024-09-16
