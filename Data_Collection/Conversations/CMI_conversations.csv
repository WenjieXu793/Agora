"@JBierw Long-term I see fossil fuel sources being fully eclipsed by renewable ones.  I view renewable diesel as transitional b/c of its emissions.  I'm talking by 2050.  It could happen sooner, but even if hydrogen efforts are successful, distribution infrastructure needs to be built.  CMI is certainly looking to where the puck is going to be as the great Gretzky would say.",2024-10-01
@jarratta So what is your take on Cummins renewable diesel x15 platform vs. their hydrogen efforts?,2024-10-01
"Thanks for the coverage and well distilled overview.  It's exceptional.  I especially appreciated the discussion around Accelera -- the last write-up didn't include it (it's small).  I love owning this company because of its heritage, culture of innovation and its performance.  The CEO is a lifer.  She's outstanding.  I think it deserves consideration from investors interested in both propulsion writ large and in energy transition.  The most impressive part of its strategy to me is it has embedded ""energy agnosticism"" as a fundamental principle.I may have a divergent view of Accelera.  I view the company's investment there as prescient.  I'm disappointed, but not surprised that it has grown slower than anticipated.  It houses CMI's work on hydrogen (both for fuel cells and as a propellant for engines) as well as its electrolyzer ops.  I'm interested that, while electric propulsion is gaining ever larger share in some very energy intense sectors like mining, current EV battery tech is unable to meet the power requirements for heavy duty pickups where Cummins PowerStroke tech has a lot of traction (pun intended).  F is also making very large investments in H fuel cells and engines.Quite a few folks think ICE will be around 4ever.  I'm not one of them. I think it will lose share in the coming decades even in the heavy duty segment.Thanks again",2024-09-30
"Thank you author for your in depth presentation.  Long $CMI; most satisfied with its Overall Market Share/Presence (maintained/increasing in areas), Global placements/JVs, specifically India and East Asia.",2024-09-30
"Cummins has solid fundamentals with really good numbers, indicating robust financial strength, profitability, growth, valuation and momentum all at the same time.The company has consistently shown predictable revenue and earnings growth, with a 21.5% revenue growth rate over the past three years and a low-risk assessment.Despite facing challenges, Cummins maintains a leadership position in the industry, supported by strategic investments in new technologies and partnerships, such as the recent $75 million grant for zero-emissions components.Currently, the stock seems to be roughly fairly valued, which makes it a promising investment for the future in the event of a possible nice dip.Cummins' Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 13.0% ranks in the 86.6% percentile for the sector.The stock is good value based on its 5y forward PEGY ratio of 1.44.Long $CMIThe stock is currently on track and at the moment it does not look like there will be a very sharp turn in the near future.",2024-09-30
It will be very interesting to watch the new Volvo group JV with Westport Fuel systems HPDi take on Cummins NG spark ignited ( bought out Westport from CWi JV) and diesel engines as Westports HPDi uses compressed technology.,2024-09-24
"@Howard Hunt I bet your Dad was at the CMI headquarters in Columbus, Indiana.  It's really a company town.  Its most remarkable feature is its remarkable array of buildings designed by the most famous Mid-Century architects in the world (columbus.in.us/...).  They were commissioned inter the auspices of J. Irwin Miller (columbus.in.us/...) the nephew of CMI's founder.  He led Cummins for a long time.",2024-09-23
Thanks for the excellent review.  I am long CMI since 2022 in IRA.  Looking for some price weakness before adding to my position.,2024-09-22
"Well, I am an old man now, and fortunately -born and raised in Indiana -my dad (pictured on the left) designed and built machine tools and did a ton of business with Cummins. So I have been long for quite some time and can’t imagine selling any. CMI is “best in class” and has proven it, over the decades.",2024-09-22
"I was also positively surprised by Cummins' development so far.Cummins' EPS growth and ROC are expected to rise due to strong demand in key markets, strategic investments in new technologies, and operational efficiencies. The company has projected significant revenue growth in regions like North America and China, alongside increased power generation sales. Additionally, Cummins' focus on innovation, such as the development of next-generation engines and zero-emission solutions, positions it well for future profitability and market leadership.The stock is good value based on its 5y PEGY ratio of 1.35 and still indicates a reasonable buy.Long $CMIOverall, the company is definitely an underrated and long-term compounder.",2024-09-22
Thanks for the coverage and excellent write-up.  I love the company.  The CEO is a lifer who's impressive.I am particularly impressed with CMI prescience with respect to new technologies that enable shifts in propulsion.  Its electrolyzer business is exciting as is its work on both H fuel and H engines.  Fuel agnosticism is exactly right.,2024-09-14
@Kody's Dividends Thanks for asking. I imagine somewhere around $240 I'd jump in. I missed my chance at the beginning of the year.,2024-09-13
"@Steady Income Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Out of curiosity, what entry point would you target for CMI?",2024-09-12
@Steady Income i am in at $190. Looking to sell upon the rebuilding of Ukraine and/or Gaza,2024-09-12
CMI is the one that got away. I started watching it at around $135 and can't bring myself to buy it at these prices even though I like the company.,2024-09-12
"Thank you for the fine article...i started a small position in CMI last month...i rarely buy cyclicals, but here i like: a) the balance sheet, b) the diversity of technology that CMI is developing (many types and sectors of power generation) and in that sense it has secular growth characteristics beyond many pure cyclicals, c) the India revenue...my portfolio is very concentrated and CMI is the smallest position, but i hope to add gradually over the next six months (and will add anywhere below 300)...",2024-09-12
"@Kody's Dividends They are each quite far from my buy points, so they are not at the top of my Watch List and I don't have an entry price that is close where I monitor them frequently to assess whether and when I am ready to pounce. For instance, DE would have to fall by at least $60 and trade much closer to $300 than $400. Leo Nelissen is consistently bullish on DE, and I have repeatedly disclosed my intentions on his many articles on DE. I have traded it successfully in the past. As an example, DE traded under $300 in July 2022, and I did buy some then and sell it for more than $420 in July 2023. It was a great trade. I would gladly do that again, if given the opportunity.",2024-09-12
"Okey dokey, Kody!I constantly follow you because I like your articles, I like your coverage of CMI and I like CMI itself, which I continue to monitor for potential investment in conjunction with DE and CAT. I like them all, but presently own none of them.With regard to CMI in particular, I would not chase it here after its appreciation of more than 25% during 2024. I don't see sufficient remaining upside potential to jump in here. Notwithstanding your rating, I think you essentially agree with me when you say:""The stock could be priced 7% below fair value.""In this macroeconomic environment, and the possibility that we are on the precipice of--if not already in--a recession, do you think the potential for 7% upside really justifies buying this cyclical stock? I don't.",2024-09-12
