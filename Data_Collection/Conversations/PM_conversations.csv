Society in America keeps reaching new lows unimaginable even ten years ago.  I fear (greatly) for our future.,2024-10-03
Is SA a pay site now?  I can't read any of the writers that I used to read for free.,2024-09-30
"What is VERY interesting is that neither MO or BTI stock have in their prices the potential loss of 10% market share loss in the U.S. cigarette market, with them contributing probably 9% points.You're talking top-line and EPS misses for both stocks because of lost business in their most lucrative smoking market.",2024-09-26
"@Ted Waller....SA seems to have the most activity forthe turbo-growth names like NVDA or the yield hogs like MO and BTI.  With PM you have decent growth -- great growth prospects for a CS stock -- and a very nice yield that only looks low since the 10-year doubled in yield the last 3 years.Again....just noting for the record that PM (well, the OLD PM !! lol) has split her stock 3-for-1 twice in the past every 30 years, 1997 and 1966.  30 years from the last one would be about 2027 which by then we'll know if this is a $200+ stock (I think it will be) and I'm sure a split of some sort will be considered.",2024-09-26
"PM held an Analyst Day with the major sell-side firms today.  Very bullish !!Goldman raised their PT to $150.  Sees PM stealing 10% of the U.S. cigarette market by 2030 -- so figure 50% comes from MO and 35% comes from BTI.  The average unit margin on cigarettes in the US is more than three times greater than PM’s global average. The economics in smoke-free:  IQOS’ average net rev/unit is 2.5x greater than PM’s int’l combustible products (and 2.6x on gross profit) and ZYN roughly 6x greater. Also, given PM does not have a legacy cigarette business in the US, it means the opportunity is purely incremental.",2024-09-26
@CorvetteKid JTI has Ploom and since they bought Vector I suppose Ploom will come to the US.,2024-09-25
"@CorvetteKid Latest numbers show 60% of vape sales are illegal. That's bad, but 40% is still a big market and getting bigger, but I'm sure the illegal brings prices down. Vapes are an integral part of the SFP future.",2024-09-25
"@Ted Waller ...it's also the fortuitious path that the stocks took with regards to regulatory stuff happening in 2017.It's why you use rolling time periods to eliminate timing bias.If you go by more recent history, PM is basically at a new ATH while MO is still down 30% and BTI about 45%.  While the lush dividends helped MO and BTI, ultimately the stocks have to grow or they will lag.",2024-09-25
@Ted Waller ....BTI has one but not with PMTA approval.  Has NOT been the winner that IQOS has been though some user reviews say it's as good or even better.Could be a VHS vs. BetaMax thing !!  :-D,2024-09-25
"@CorvetteKid I don't believe MO or BTI has an IQOS-like product that's ready to go now, so that market is gold for PM. It takes years to develop a good one.",2024-09-25
"@Ted Waller ....the U.S. market is sort of like the Wild Wild West.  You have so many different methods of nicotine delivery that it's not clear which one will be the Big Winner.Because PM has 0% market share in combustibles, ANYTHING IQOS gains is win-win...not like in other markets where PM introduces IQOS and they are already the #1 or #2 player.The big thing is if PM can somehow strike a deal with CNTC and gain access to the China market.  That could add 3-5% of top-line revenue growth for a decade.  Maybe CNTC buys a stake in PM in exchange for access to the Chinese market.Not even sure why their market is closed as it's a violation of GATT/WTO.",2024-09-25
"@CorvetteKid I'm thinking PM will have at least 33% of the SFP US market by then. Think IQOS, ZYN, VEEV, and other smoke free options. Maybe more.",2024-09-25
The Debt/EBITA number is in-line with most Consumer Staples companies.  It should be low enough to permit meanginful buybacks by 2026.,2024-09-25
"Good article summing up the lucrative opportunity in the U.S. market -- IF PM can grab 10% of the profit pool with HNB IQOS in 5-7 years.  So far, HNB seems to be either a huge hit (Japan) or a decent market share grabber (lower penetration countries).  So I presume they grab SOME significant share of the U.S. combustible market, especially when they introduce the IQOS 3.0 advanced system with PMTA.",2024-09-25
@omghcarman Reinvesting is the ticket with PM. I've been doing it since 70.,2024-09-24
Thank You for the article. Long a small position of PM in my SEP retirement account. I'm reinvesting.,2024-09-24

@CorvetteKid How will our weakening reserve currency status and huge and growing deficit  impact the future value of our currency??. I love graphs they are an excellent tool.  But don't account for shifts in the paradigm.,2024-09-23
"@ccking3 Yes, I know. It's that big divvy. The rule of 72 means an 8% yield will double your original investment in 9 years without even considering cap gains.",2024-09-23
