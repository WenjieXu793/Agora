@Socrates9 - why are they sending you an invoice via email?  Haven't they heard of email?,2024-09-15
"@Socrates9 I don't use it but my GF sends money to her kids using Zelle, which is owned by a consortium of large banks.  Z doesn't charge fees for sending money though not all banks use it.This is promo info from US Bank:Zelle lets you send, receive and request money with your trusted customers and eligible vendors. If your customer uses Zelle through their financial institution, they can send payments directly to your U.S. Bank account. Simply provide them with your email address or United States mobile number. The money will be withdrawn from their account and deposited into your account within minutes.Zelle is available to consumers at over 2,000 financial institutions.",2024-09-14
"@Socrates9 they could send an email with the bill and then you can setup billpay with your bank. Or if the bill is the same amount every month, just setup the billpay to pay automatically.",2024-09-14
@Skagit I almost don’t care if they have a branch anymore. I know if I have a real issue I will have to drive across town to one with a real manager or someone with authority to fix problems. Only a few branches seem to have anyone in them anymore that can solve an actual problem. Most are just branches with some tellers and a floating manager that’s usually not there. Banking is not what it was for anyone anymore.,2024-09-14
"@vmg I know this entire subject here is off topic but it hit such a nerve with me I had to comment. It just took 11 days to get a letter from 4 miles away with USPS and they charge what, $0.75 for that service now after their most recent in a slew of rate hikes? This type of thing happens regularly now and the same person sends me mail every month (I should say invoice) and it’s gone from overnight to over a week in the last decade or so. This means sometimes half the time I have to pay the bill is used up in transit or rather sitting in a post office. Now if I don’t stick a payment in the mail practically the day I get the invoice I cannot be assured they will get it on time. This persons business is too small to setup an online payment solution so they say they are stuck but I would have no issue if they did. I wouldn’t trust USPS to deliver my payments anymore if it were free. Not to mention the majority of people check their accounts online at least once a month and could arrange a payment at that time. Mailing paper statements is a huge cost item to have and a no brainer to reduce if running a bank. Postage has just about doubled in the last few years while there service went down the drain. But just my two cents.",2024-09-14
