"@Nelson Smith Do you think there is a lot of corporate bloat and inefficiency in operations with TAP?If so, it would merit a buy. If its pretty lean already, perhaps not. A company with great products and reoccuring revenue combined with poor operations is target rich for private equity, If so, and I were to handicap this, I'd say it PE would make a bid before a competitor does.",2024-09-13
@cboe77 I'm not sure who a logical buyer would be. BUD already has lots of debt. Maybe Heineken? Their balance sheet is slightly better.,2024-09-13
"TAP popped to 57/58 a week ago on large vol, options were extremely active as well, action spoke to being ""in play"", or activism, thoughts anyone?",2024-09-13
"I have a few shares of TAP in a managed account that by and large has done reasonably well. Unfortunately, this is not one of the investments that has done well. I would not have bought it myself, but living in Australia makes having an American based share account challenging and I was fortunate almost 8 years ago that someone took me on and my account has more than tripled in that time period, so I cannot complain.",2024-09-12
"@calf's pen the seltzer market IS still growing, as you stated. But as a percentage share of the total alcohol market, it's shrinking. I believe TAP's share is well below ten percent, probably six or seven percent. TAP will continue to be an also ran in the seltzer and whiskey market. They just don't have the sales, the advertising budget, or the shelf space. To me, being an also ran is just a waste of money. I believe they should stick to beer, where they are among the top brewers by sales.",2024-09-12
"@southbuckeye I disagree. Did you know they are now over 10,000 craft breweries in the U.S?  10 years ago, there were 4,000. The craft beer market accounts for 13% of  total domestic beer consumption. Further, the average price per bottle of craft beer is now a staggering $4.  I think its safe to say this market is completely saturated and building share there is a difficult proposition.As for trying new things and having limited success, at least they are trying. and as for your comment about the seltzer market, it is still growing nicely and is forecasted to grow at 15% CAGR through 2033.In my mind, BUD will continue to screw up, and the one company TAP and others will continue to take market share from.",2024-09-12
"TAP's problem is management being enticed by shiny new things. Recently they have spent large amounts of money on seltzers and whiskey. They know nothing about whiskey and have a tiny share of the market. Seltzers peaked years ago, and once again TAP has a small piece of that market. They recently sold their craft beers to another company, instead of supporting these brands. TAP is, after all, considered a beer company. Or at least it was before selling beer brands and  getting into seltzers and whiskey. Management of TAP is inept. Stick to things like Miller Lite and Coors Light and original Coors beer. TAP is successful in these areas. Everything else, not so much.",2024-09-12
"Good writeup. We all know most institutional investors loathe buying low single digit or no growth companies. So I agree with you, TAP will stay rangebound for the foreseeable future. Perhaps the way to view TAP is like a Regulated utility or a REIT. You hope to get a few percentage point increase per year plus a healthy divvie for a 6-9% total return.BTW ,on the diversified beverage portfolio slide, why aren't Molson products shown?",2024-09-12
