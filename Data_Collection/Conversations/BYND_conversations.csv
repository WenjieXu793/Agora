"@beach_trader Beyond Meat is all risk no reward. However, some of the undercovered stocks with a lot of upside don't get the traffic. Like my $rcel article.",2024-10-03
Not surprised you don't have a position here. the financials are ugly,2024-10-03
"@Clark158f1 Yes, folks buy overpriced rickety thematic stocks at their peril.IF Ersatz meat is so much less of a drain on natural resources WHY is not AT LEAST 50% cheaper.In their state of hubris, management thought folks wanted to pay double for what popular opinion consider an inferior product. Beyond Meat, an unworkable idea poorly executed by a Space Cadet. Yes, liquidation looks inevitable...",2024-09-27
Just found this as I saw BYND over $ 7 again.......such a chuckle.BYND will bounce around for some time but death is a certainty in the long run.In addition management is terrible. They have not raised cash on any of the short squeeze pops like other companies have done....and they need cash.,2024-09-27
"Noah, you are not doing your readers asking them to buy this stinker.Sales contracting, cost unsustainable and no prospect of turning a profit.Stock price up or down a certain zero.",2024-09-19
@Noah's Arc Capital Management It's absurd - there is almost zero chance equity worth anything with those converts. Only reason everyone doesn't short it to zero is 85% borrow rate and it might take couple years.,2024-09-19
@Noah's Arc Capital Management are you unaware of converts trading below 20 which points to almost certain bk/restructuring at some point?,2024-09-19
"@szgch the converts trade under 20 cents. The company will almost certainly go bankrupt and/or the converts will take over the equity. The only reason everyone is not short is the borrow rate of 80% and the fact the company may hold on a few years until converts are due in 27. The fact that the author either doesn’t know this or discuss this as risk, lol, literally invalidates everything this author discusses. How is this possible?",2024-09-19
"@Energy Alpha Its a high risk play for sure but this is asymmetric at this point imo. Not sure if you have ever read Nassim Taleb or Mark Spitznagel's work but they make a series of small, low probability bets that could have high upside. I think this could qualify",2024-09-19
"This seems like a recommendation (Strong Buy in this case) looking for a justification.  If we play the game of “what would it take to become CF positive”, there are really two options, grow revenues or cut costs.  In reality revenues are declining YOY, so it will be a challenge just to keep revenues flat.  That leaves cost cutting which would require a 20-30% reduction in COGS, SG&A and Other.  While not impossible, that’s a lot of self help required to get to break even.  And once they get to break even they have to improve further to become an attractive investment.  That hardly feels like a Strong Buy.",2024-09-19
The balance sheet is extremely risky. It is not cash flow positive yet…,2024-09-19
yes if it was not for the Sword of Damocles hanging over their heads -the $1 BILLION CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES - this could wipe out shareholders completely.,2024-09-19
"@Pabst You're basis is built on conflating unlike situations, during unlike times. They'll go bankrupt first, and then someone will pickup the pieces. Tons of debt, little demand, they're spiraling downward. You're literally the only person on SA that cares about them, which is quite telling. Additionally, every vegan and vegetarian I know doesn't want fake highly processed food that tastes almost, but not at all like meat. They all eat whole foods, with maybe some rice and quality bread being the limits of consumed processed food. The entire industry is flailing, for good reason. It's an occasional purchase for people who want to mix it up. Shorting that a few years back was easy money, nothing left on that bone now.",2024-09-18
"@Energy Alpha @elephant analytics Thanks for your input. Not only has the company reported some positive sales and margin progress, the shelves at Wegman's, Giant (aka Stop and Shop) and Whole Foods prominently display both brands (I prefer BYND's products). Those are the brands I see moving, despite store brands offering comparable products at a slight discount. I've also noticed some pricing power with Beyond. Come Jan. '25, look for an improved economy and GenZers/Millennials returning to the fold, especially with the roll-out of a new vegan steak.",2024-09-13
"@Pabst Invest as you like but I see this as a zombie company, burning cash and awaiting debt restructuring, either prior to or via bankruptcy.  They may keep doors open for awhile, but despite how many vegans rave about their products, they aren't flying off the shelves and the company has had to drop prices to move product.  The market loved the name at the time of the IPO and the stock ran up on hopes and dreams, but the company didn't deliver the numbers.  At this point they need a growth runway to profitability and not really clear what that looks like.  I rarely see their products on menus anymore and they keep getting pushed off to a smaller and more remote space in the grocery stores, whereas they used to be featured prominently.  Until something changes, I see this stock having asymmetric risk to the downside.  I've been wrong on many occasions so maybe I don't have the vision for this one and I'm missing something.",2024-09-13
"@Pabst I doubt there will be much acquisition interest until BYND deals with its debt. At a bit over $6 per share and including net debt, BYND is currently valued at around $1.3 billion.That's close to 4x revenues for a company that is struggling with cash burn and trying to figure out how to grow again.Might be some interest in the brand/company, but not at its current price with its debt.",2024-09-13
"@Pabst with all due respect, BYND debt is greater than assets. Not sure why anybody would acquire a company with negative cash flow and negative equity. Why not wait until they restructure debt in bankruptcy and then consider buying. Having said that, their products were given ample opportunity to gain traction post launch with every restaurant offering and every grocery store providing prime shelf space. The demand is not sufficient or the COGS is too high.  Take your pick.",2024-09-13
"Look for a co like Kellogg's/Kellanova  to buy BYND. I went vegetarian in Jan. '92; mid '90s bought Worthington Foods, a veg food co that also owned Loma Linda veg foods. Only days after buying WF, K bought it. Too many veg tastebuds exist & will keep BYND going. Expect shakeout; smaller companies' products don't check all the sensory sensation boxes like BYND and Impossible do.",2024-09-13
Who would have thought highly processed fake meat would have so few customers...!,2024-09-10
