"@knoxmarlow So, you need me to tell you what ATUS management has said publicly? Talk about someone who should be working for no cash compensation.",2024-09-25
"@knoxmarlow Management teams of publicly-traded companies generally do not work for no cash compensation (how would they live?). If you only invest in companies that employ managers who do not receive cash compensation, your portfolio will be quite small.",2024-09-25
"@Value Validater  Because the management team ultimately wants to maximize its compensation package, regardless of returns to shareholders (majority or otherwise).How many times do you see a management team run a business into bankruptcy, and then get paid millions because they are best positioned to help the business emerge from bankruptcy?  Or how many times is a management team complicit in a takeunder transaction from a majority shareholder?  This stuff happens all the time.Again I was wondering if this management team had shown any indication that it would pursue the five-point plan that you listed in the original post.",2024-09-24
I'm in I find the price and MC extremely low compared to peers.,2024-09-23
"@knoxmarlow How is ATUS management conflicted? ATUS has a majority shareholder whose sole objective is for the stock price to go up. He needs the money and cannot afford to buy out the ATUS minority shareholders.I did not say that these changes are ""just around the corner.""ATUS management has publicly acknowledged its objective to stabilize Adjusted EBITDA.ATUS management has publicly acknowledged that it has worked with Goldman Sachs who pioneered the fiber securitization market.LightPath already has a private equity investor who will need an exit.ATUS is nearing the end of fiber build-out.ATUS has to refinance itself within the next couple of years.Facts matter.",2024-09-23

Nice overview article.  The stock has been a dumpster fire ,2024-09-19
"ATUS is a special situation investment based on the following:1. Stabilize adjusted EBITDA through its fiber build-out and running the company more efficiently under its current CEO.2. Step down capital expenditures once it completes its fiber build-out.3. Complete a re-financing through a fiber securitization. Goldman Sachs has pioneered this area of debt financing. It works.4. Sell its Lightpath affilate. The related debt deconsolidates and the equity purchase price pays down debt further.5. Pay down debt further through the use of its free cash flow reflecting maintenace cap ex rather than build-out cap ex.These five steps will reduce its net debt/Adjusted EBITDA. Given the current leverage, a reasonably satisfactory execution of this plan may drive its stock price significantly higher.",2024-09-19
