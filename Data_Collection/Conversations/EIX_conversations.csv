"""If we were to meet all of California's needs with just solar and storage, we would need to blanket an area the size of the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area with solar""So what's the problem? If you've been in California you will know that there is a truly vast amount of desolate desert land that could have quite a few panels on it. Some lizards and turtles might have to be relocated.",2024-09-26

"""If we were to meet all of California's needs with just solar and storage, we would need to blanket an area the size of the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area with solar,"" Pizarro told Reuters.that could and was being done, until california destroyed the rooftop solar industry.but of course we can't depend on a right-wing edison sycophant to actually tell the truth about a policy that he supported, because it interferes with edison business:""For those who are curious, the three investor-owned utilities – PG&E, SoCal Edison and SDG&E – are behind the pressure and misinformation campaign to kill rooftop solar.The utilities’ campaign against rooftop solar is being waged by a nice-sounding front group called “Affordable Clean Energy for All”. They have a slick website called Fix the Cost Shift. They claim to be a coalition of many organizations working together to address the so-called “cost shift”, which falsely claims that rooftop solar causes utility bills to rise for those without solar.""",2024-09-25
