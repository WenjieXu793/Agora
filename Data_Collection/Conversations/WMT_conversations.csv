"@justaguy11 automation is inevitable. Once upon a time it took 100 farmers and ranch hands to work a thousand acres. Now it’s done by 3. Once upon a time carpenters used hand saws and hammers. That’s been upgraded for productivity. You would not be able to afford a house if 45 extra craftsmen were on the payroll cutting boards by hand. The longshoremen unload cargo. Pretty basic.  Not rocket science or brain surgery. They need to train their teams to install and repair the automated machinery not fight it. Out of 360 worldwide ports, LA and Long Beach are dead last in productivity. That’s embarrassing. Time to step it up. 8 hours of pay for 8 hours of work. No more slack hustles. No more ghost shifts for A listers.",2024-10-04
It's not over until the rank and file approve it.Anything could screw it up and the picket lines will be right back.,2024-10-03
Stike over.  Should help tomorrow if the jobs report is less than sanguine.,2024-10-03
They had better not agree to no automation or this will only happen again....and again.....and.....,2024-10-03
@Peter Jaworowski Agreed.  So it makes sense to pay labor more to agree to more automation - which the ILWU did in the sixties.West Coast and East Coast have very different unions.,2024-10-03
@Peter Jaworowski I saw a proposal on Twitter that would actually be a lot cheaper in the long-run to give these parasites a one-time large settlement so they can just retire and allow the automation. It's like elevator operators 100 years ago--cheaper just to pay them to go away than to keep paying their salaries.,2024-10-03
"@M11M all valid points. I will say that approximately 70% of Costco annual sales are made up of executive memberships (the not so price conscious individuals).  That other 30% is for sure some price sensitive individuals. And I feel like those individuals just have the membership for the sake of having one. I myself have a membership and only spend about $175-200 a month on groceries. I’m a simple eater, but Costco has everything I need and I know I’m going to get a good deal on it. I also know besides groceries I’ll have a gadget or two or some clothes. I do like how they’re pushing e comm, with online only items though.",2024-10-02
"@Dmillionaire I agree that the treasure hunt is a big part of Costco's appeal, and it definitely works for many shoppers. However, I think they do so at their peril by not fully embracing online grocery delivery with features like EBT/SNAP payment options. People increasingly value convenience, and while Instacart offers a solution, the fees and markups can add up, making it less appealing for budget-conscious shoppers who are already paying for a Costco membership.On the other hand, Walmart seems to be doubling down on its grocery delivery service. Have you gotten a Walmart Plus membership yet and tried out their free grocery delivery service? The prices are good, and it beats having to go to a grocery store, wrestle for parking, and risk items being out of stock. It's like the difference between having a washer and dryer at home and having to lug your clothes to the laundromat every week.  Sure, you might get some exercise and socialize at the laundromat, but having the convenience and efficiency of laundry at home is hard to beat. Similarly, with grocery delivery, you save time, avoid the hassle, and can be sure you're getting the items you need.Have you considered trying Walmart+ or another grocery delivery service to see how it compares to your Costco runs?",2024-10-01
"@M11M great points! to this I would say Costco thrives on the treasure hunt anyway. E comm still makes up a small percentage of overall sales, but definitely adding EBT/snap will contribute to revenue. I wouldn’t say there missing out on it though.",2024-10-01
"No question, it’s cranking on all cylinders and I made a small fortune on it but I sure would not buy at these prices.",2024-09-30
"@Pennywise505 the only ones burning is ŰȘ and the whole west, the despicable 12% of human population, the vermins.  $36T in debt and counting another 1T every 100 days.  Interest payments now reaching $1T, more than your military budget LOL",2024-09-29
DG should retreat back into rural territory - and shrink,2024-09-27
"I'm actually doubling down on DG.  Once they wind down all these new store openings, they'll start showing a bigger profit.",2024-09-27
"WMT is what Nick Sleep would call a Scaled Economy Shared company along with AMZN and COST.  It's never a stock that is a sell but I would rather own COST and AMZN which have markets where they are growing in larger TAM.  COST in the high-end nondiscretionary brand products and AMZN which is adding pretty much everything a consumer would buy to their Prime ecosystem. These stocks are never a sell, the only time you sell is when you need the money.",2024-09-26
"@J2289 - I agree with you on building growth of WMT, but have you checked out the online system lately?  I go to Amazon and price an item and then go to WMT... WMT usually wins...  I think their online system will give them additional growth.",2024-09-26
@ex institutional listed derivatives analyst my Japanese wife who is  only into brand items bought at Costco over Tiffany’s,2024-09-25
@Finding Your Retirement Whole Foods has not done well... they can't figure it out.. not like I thought they would,2024-09-25
@Jon Brien Different quality between the two in my opinion.. I own WMT stock so please keep going!,2024-09-25
@Finding Your Retirement You think the Tech Bros are loading up at Costco in San Jose every weekend?,2024-09-25
@J2289 WMT will continue to grow... I own both for over 15 years! Count on them both to keep chugging along!,2024-09-25
