@sgossett I too have been amazed by the run. It was an F on valuation from Schwab at $290,2024-10-03
@Always Bullish yes very glad I was buying in the 80s and 90s. Plus got shares of solventum that I will eventually sell. I bought as an income stock. Cutting dividend hurt but not surprising given the spinoff. Also cant complain about the 35-40% rise.,2024-10-03
"3M is a financial powerhouse that made you serious upside if you bought all the way down to 80 like I did.,I wouldn’t buy more at current prices but I’m pegging a next target price at 150. This is GE and IBM revisited",2024-10-03
"AXON is a trump trade. Over 150x P/EBITDA, I think around 100 P/E... worth 3 times Nividia? Give me a break. This is a total meme stock by now. It's actually quite frustrating. I bought puts on it with 12% of my portfolio and it has went up since the strike.. insanity. Just goes to show not to mess with meme stocks. At least I've made 40% on my portfolio with vix calls for the strike. I learned a serious lesson from this AXON trade and my past CVNA puts.",2024-10-01
"If you bought 3M like I did all the way down to 80, you would have made a tremendous upside. 3M is a financial too big to fail powerhouse. My TP 150.",2024-10-01
"Interesting Analysis! Have a nice POSITIVE position in 3M. If you were going to sell a position, where would you put your resources",2024-10-01
"@pakrolltide we’re a long ways from euphoric with 3m. Maybe a little bit, so a correction could happen to shake out weak hands. But the rebound that’s taken place seems like a reversal in trend. I think 3m continues to go higher. I don’t see it stalling & pulling back until 150.",2024-10-01
"@Always Bullish to me it doesnt matter where you bought a position.  That is emotional trading.  ""I am up and can afford for it to go down a bit"".  That is, bluntly imo, bs.   Investing, you do the fundamental analysis as. well as look for opportunities of upside or warnings of downside and determine WHY you are in it, WHY it will grow.  Growth = increasing wealth.  Your decision sb where is the puck going as Gretzky noted, not where it was (purchase price).Valuation is stretched.  I have CC on 2/3 of my position ($145 - Dec).  I like the new mgmt who has been successful in past companies.  Shows ability to turnaround.  This and the lawsuits are being resolved, so the unknowns are being removed.   So the setup is upside from performance, which has to happen as I noted valuation is stretched on historical basis.  So the thesis here is improved performance.  If that does not occur, then you should bail to other growth opportunities. No reason to sell if growth is still there.  Buffett isnt holding if growth disappears regardless of where he bought the position.",2024-09-25
If your cost basis is low and your up substantially as I am hold appears the right strategy. 3M like GE and IBM will continue to grow. Buffett once explained that holding long-term equities that you bought with an extreme margin of safety and you hold to increase your net worth is like a free loan from the government” I think that tells it all in a nutshell. That is as long as Kamala doesn’t tax your unrealized gains as she has propped to do.,2024-09-25
fwiw.. new multiweek high on mmm/spy pair ...it has taken out multiple tops from march to august 2022.. on absolute basis seems to be targeting 155.77 high,2024-09-24
Started building a position in the low 100's after analyst positive reports on new CEO from L3 Harris and UTC. Great turnaround track record in large industrial co's. Glad I did but now a bit hesitant of adding to position while stock stutters in the 130's and keeping my cost basis low. Its still early in the new management reign.... Long $MMM,2024-09-17
"@karondongotbanned I think it can go higher, just needs to pull back more before it does. Everyone’s bullish on it right now. I have friends that know nothing about the market buying it right now. Usually a bad sign that’s overheated.",2024-09-16
"@G1949 in my opinion, nvidia iwll never go down. right now its cheap to buy, estimated price is 200 a share by EOY",2024-09-15
"@karondongotbanned doubt it, intc will be fine when they get their factory built. If it goes to 10 I’ll keep dollar cost averaging. Nvda I would wait for a bigger pull back. It went up 13x in 1 year. Too high now to buy.",2024-09-13
@G1949 you will go bankrupt buying intel. i suggest you switch to nvidia,2024-09-11
@oldpaperboy4GHP i suggest you switch to nvidia. 100% return per year,2024-09-11
