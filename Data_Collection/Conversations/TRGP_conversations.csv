"Despite the false narrative of trump and the republicans, as I have been writing on Seeking Alpha for a few years now: we live in a ""New Age of Energy Abundance"" and the U.S. is energy independent (by an estimated ~3 million boe/d) and is the #1 petroleum producer on the planet and the #1 LNG exporter on the planet. This is one reason the XLE Energy ETF is one of the worst performing sector ETFs over the past decade (if not the worst ...) and if it wasn't for Putin & Netanyahu's wars, the results would have been even worst, and likely significantly so. Meantime, note the American ""big-3"" (Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips) aren't making any significant investments in wind, solar, and battery backup capacity. As a result, they are increasingly ill-prepared for the 21st Century of electrification and they are increasingly contributing to global warming, and we saw the results of that with the horrific recent hurricane that laid waste to so much of the Southeastern U.S. and took more than 100 lives.There is no way the planet will stop burning up as long as the ""Big-3"" (little 3?) refused to invest some of their cash-flow directly into renewables. Further, the supposed ""carbon sequestration"" is a total disaster, ineffective, and waste of time, money, and resources. What a world!",2024-10-02
Good work Thank you But that price doesnâ€™t seem justified JMHO,2024-09-27
May I pose a key question here? This sector is interesting from a valuation standpoint - are we seeing at this point any significant insider buying??,2024-09-16
"Could you please add DINO, HF Sinclair Corporation, to your list in the future? Also DK, Delek US Holdings, Inc. Many thanks in advance.It appears you are looking at the refiners and these two should be in your universe.",2024-09-16
@Elarotsap I'm crossing my fingers for a dip to $100 or below to reenter.,2024-09-14
@Elarotsap we bought it at 35 also. Energy now makes up 26 % of our stock holdings. I had a professor of environmental chemistry in 1974 at UCSB who spent half the class on why alternative energies will never replace oil and gas. Soo true. Good work for you.,2024-09-13
"@Saries I've been running in and out of the burrow with excitement. This is a contrarian's delight.Disc; long/overweight XOM, APA, CVX, OXY, DVN, XLE, ENB, KMI, PSX, NFG, UNG, SU, (OGZPY, LUKOY)",2024-09-13
"I love it!!! Make it cheap for me, big boys!!!!!",2024-09-13
"Thanks to the shorters, I first bought XOM in 2021 @ 34.25, when oil was ""uninvestable.""  Since I'm still buying the dips, I hope they keep shorting!",2024-09-13
"@Abcd8 It has been going on for years, so I don't know.  I think it is manipulation of the stock that should be investigated.",2024-09-13
"@Saries Right, it is the most undervalued sector by far. Just take a look at this table:finviz.com/...",2024-09-13
@jakeelwood5 I would really like to know what those who short APA think. APA has huge FCF Margin compared to other S&P500 companies and also to other famous oil producers.Just check this FCF Margin from Seeking Alpha:seekingalpha.com/...Why would anyone short such a company?,2024-09-13
"@Saries Not to mention that the entire sector is so beaten  down by the people who think oil is obsolete that it's hard to imagine much of a drop.Seriously, most of these companies have fortress balance sheets, massive cash-flows, rising dividends, share buy-back programs, and are trading around 10x earnings...What on earth are they hoping for?",2024-09-13
"This is probably the most dangerous sector to short. One hurricane, war, production and/or delivery interruption and everything changes. Personally, think a casino is a safer bet.",2024-09-13
"Adding shares to dividend aristocrats XOM, CVX. Keep compounding the dividends.",2024-09-13
Would think downstream be the big winner should oil prices collapse as isn't this their biggest expense being oil? Also appear to have a fuel distribution revolution underway in trucking in the USA and at some point presumably waterborne too no position,2024-09-13
"Exactly the time to add to my positions in select oil and gas companies--- they will do great in the longer term....Buy profitable cash cow companies when everyone and his brother (and shorts) hate them!!!     I just did-----couldn't care less about very short term prices---with dividends and price appreciation, I can't wait to check on these investment in the next 1-2 years.....Buy low---sell high!!!",2024-09-13
APA is continually bouncing up and down because of traders short plays.,2024-09-13
Technically it looks bad if we break multi year support. Long many. TA: mishtalk.com/...Support breaks 55 is in play per mish,2024-09-13
