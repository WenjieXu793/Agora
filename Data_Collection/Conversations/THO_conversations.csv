"why stock up so much? can't see earnings call yet, if it happened .. what'd they say?these are all really good developments:""Consolidated gross profit margin for the quarter was 15.8%, which was an improvement of 140 basis points over a year ago, aided in part by a favorable LIFO inventory adjustment due to reductions in inventory levels as well as an improved warranty cost percentage. "" Especially the last part. Quality improving. Inventory clearing out. Good.",2024-09-24
Terrible outlook  THO  $4.50 vs $6.31 expected and this is probably best operator..any bounce is hope,2024-09-24
@7357851 that said these stocks have bounced on rate cuts - market is giving them benefit of doubt. Thor will probably go up today. Should be 75 dollar stock. I think the issue is more structural and a little lower interest rates not going to solve the issue,2024-09-24
"@beach_trader Agree.  Other than blind hope, I can't understand why anyone would buy $CWH at $23-24 share.  The Feds lowering the overnight rate is not having that much of an impact on long-term rates, so I don't see consumer discretionary taking off like a rocket.  Further, housing and ""service inflation"" does not look contained, so middle class consumers (who buy RVs and pleasure craft) are squeezed in every possible direction.",2024-09-24
Guidance is terrible - obviously getting less ordered as dealers can’t sell current inventory- rvs and boats nowhere near bottom.,2024-09-24
"@SolidStateHydrogen Agree.  I'm no advocate of hydrogen for fueling vehicles.  Some people see the factual evidence of compression costs and still believe it is feasible.  It is not cost effective based on what we know now.  Yet, research continues.",2024-09-23
"@trentbridge I am not sure if I’ve seen this one, the last direct sunlight to H2 panel I saw was 10% efficient which is less than commercial panels feeding electrolyzers which leaves the opportunity to upgrade to more efficient  electrolyzers. over the life of the panels so I didn’t see the point of getting excited.  After producing the hydrogen it still has to be compressed.  H2 compressors are exceptionally expensive CAPEX with high operating costs.  NABH4 will off gas compresed.",2024-09-22
"@trentbridge Hydrogen is a dead end with current technology.  Gas and cryo forms are so low in energy density that it is uneconomical, dangerous and inconvenient to distribute for fuel.  Cryo H2 loses 1% of loads every 24 hours.  A hydrogen tanker would need 5 trips for one of liquid Natural Gas.  Add embrittlement and GHG issues and it’s not a smart move.  Solid forms are cheaper in the end, but much R&D is required for them and little has been spent with the markets fixation on batteries.  Regretfully, the only place money is being spent on this is China.",2024-09-22
Perhaps Northvolt's impending bankruptcy will serve a salutary lesson.The EU's bizarro Green New Deal is how Europe dies; the 21st century version of the Treaty of Versailles.The rest of the world laughing all the way to the bank...,2024-09-15
"@trentbridge BMW is not about to switch to H2 vehicles. This is just taking advantage of government subsidies/promotions driven by the oil lobby.Toyota appears to have given up selling hydrogen cars in California, maybe I am wrong as I am waiting to see Q3 results, but so far sales have been a small fraction of previous years.",2024-09-15
"Speculating on CCL again.  Bought last week and am hoping for a pop after the Fed meeting, and then will probably sell.",2024-09-12
