"Hi, why is RCL free cash flow TTM is negative ?",2024-10-08 10:56:14.381345
"I have a small position in my IRA, a less than 1% position.  I'm up 30%, and I am dripping the stock.  I am expecting  that absent another pandemic, RCL will provide nice returns going forward.  Debt and interest rate are my primary concerns, but RCL appears to be paying down its substantial debt, and interest rates should moderate going forward although I do not expect them to return to pandemic rate level.  Thank you for the article.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
"@dwtaylor1055 The challenge I see is the US wealth gap continues to grow at an alarming rate, along with the national debt, and the situation doesn't seem sustainable.Perhaps the biggest challenge is housing affordability.  The solution here is not a good economic outcome.",2024-09-19 00:00:00.000000
"@Dukebailey futures are showing everything liked it lol I am getting 2007 vibes with this 50 BPS cut.  2007 to the same day they did a 50 BPS cut and he is what followed over the next 18 months.Sep 17, 2007 S&P 500 @ 1533(Rate cut of 50 BPS)Oct 7, 2007 S&P 500 @ 1574May 11, 2008 S&P 500 @ 1425Sep 14, 2008 S&P 500 @ 1279Mar 1, 2009 S&P 500 @ 6872025 is going to be a rocky year(I hope not).  Yes the market is stronger and more resilient than 2007, however, other indicators are following similar instances when a recession is near.",2024-09-19 00:00:00.000000
"@Tyler Durden 42 True, and I am a bit surprised that it was 50 bps.",2024-09-18 00:00:00.000000
"@Dukebailey I don't think the market had a half a point cut priced in.  Possible, yes.",2024-09-18 00:00:00.000000
"@dwtaylor1055 You may be right, but makes no sense as said rate cut was communicated awhile ago at Jackson Hole.",2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
"I'm also neutral on cruise lines.  Prices are high which is pushing margins in the same direction.  This is driving very strong current earnings.  I worry that this could fade with any economic weakness (which i predict to arrive in the coming months).  Overall, i have been happy with RCL's product when i've travelled with Celebrity.  Additionally, I'd like to take a cruise to Dubrovnik sometime.  I hear it's a spectacular destination!",2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
I assume CCL will get a nice bump on Wednesday with the first rate cut.,2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
"@Albert Anthony 1-year forward PT of $200, likely higher using a 15X PE multiple.  I'm guessing the appropriate EBITDA multiple would give similar results.  My own model shows an EPS similar to consensus although RCL keeps pushing its guidance up, so there may be positive surprises.  One potential headwind is the economy although need to keep in mind that the total cost of a cruise vacation is about 75% to 80% of the all-in cost of a land-based vacation, so there is some cushion.",2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
"@Michael - D “Best as in, best experience. Said nothing about investing in them.“This is an investing site, not a cruise forum - the context is always (should be), investing.“Your fanfare of $RCL may be tempered after you realize it's only up about 3x in 25 years”Here again, you have the wrong context.  I never advocated for RCL as an investment - I merely pointed out that they were the best performer in the industry.  If that qualifies as publishing fanfare, so be it.Having said that, you are ignoring dividends.  The RCL share price is 548% higher, adjusted for dividends, than it was 25 years ago.Fun fact:RCL shareholder return since going public on April 28, 1993 = 2,856% return, or 11.2% CAGRSPY return during same timeframe = 2,274% return, or 10.4% CAGRApparently, RCL has been a superior market performer, in addition to a superior industry performer.  My fanfare appears to be justified.",2024-09-15 00:00:00.000000
@Albert Anthony  I have a cost average of $73. Should I buy more at a dip to $150-155 or should I sell if it goes a bit higher? If I buy more at this price my cost average will go up (unfortunately)...,2024-09-15 00:00:00.000000
"@Dukebailey Best as in, best experience. Said nothing about investing in them.Cruise lines are horrendous investments over long periods of time. High capex and lots of debt make them trades, at best. Similar to airlines. Your fanfare of $RCL may be tempered after you realize it's only up about 3x in 25 years, with much heartache - booms and busts - in-between then and now. Right now it's at a cyclical peak, so the 3x over 25 years will be less in bad times.",2024-09-15 00:00:00.000000
"@dkohler555 appreciate your feedback.  speaking of bullishness, what do you think is a fair value price range to buy RCL at and why?",2024-09-15 00:00:00.000000
"@Michael - D The relative share price performance between RCL and NCLH since NCLH became a public company in 2013 says otherwise.  During that timeframe, NCLH share price is down 23%, adjusted for dividends, while RCL share price is up 523%.",2024-09-15 00:00:00.000000

"@Dukebailey ""The reason that Viking underperforms the majors is they do not have casinos.""They also don't have gyms, if you exclude their non-ocean liners. Which is strange for a non-gambling, more holistic focused customer base. Total dealbreaker for me and many others.""Having said that, RCL is the best cruise line by far - assets, quality, innovation and overall excellence.""No. $NCLH owned Oceania and Regent Seven Seas are by far the best. Windstar is good for South Pacific. It was also good for Alaska but they dropped that route this year because it got too busy with the monstrosity ships.",2024-09-15 00:00:00.000000
