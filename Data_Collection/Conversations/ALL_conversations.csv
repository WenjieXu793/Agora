"@susan58 looks like you were right about the storm potential, a big storm out of nowhere is expected to hit the west coast of Florida now. Looked on NOAA and wind speed probabilities aren't anything intense yet for anywhere populated, but we'll know more after the weekend.",2024-10-06
@Hugh Arhue there are storms every year- this year has actually been quite up until Helene. With Helene again many of the claims will be related to flood insurance which is quite different scenario.,2024-10-04
agreed P & C is a sector not frequently mentioned by investors but one of my favorites. KBWP has been an excellent ETF for this sector- great long hold. There will always be hurricanes and have been throught many myself but the top insurers are financially sound and this baked into their business models,2024-10-04
Interesting timing of the article considering the estimated $95B - $125B in property losses caused by Hurricane Helene. Crazy weather is only getting worse and will impact insurers.,2024-10-03
"@susan58 Adding to @Logan Kane's comment, the more a company rips you off and makes your life hell, the more likely you should own their stock. Especially if it's a company/service you can't live without.  Simple yet effective investment formula.Take Amazon for example. I had a business which earned affiliate commissions and being in the very top tier of performers, I was entitled to 12.5%. Year by year they dwindled that down to 1% and even now 0.5%. Think about that... prior, I would earn $1.25M per $10M of sales. Several years later, that same $10M of sales only earned me $50k, which wasn't even enough to pay for the annual server bill.What did I do? Complained a lot, just like you, but then just bought a bunch in Amazon stock. When you can't beat 'em, join 'em.",2024-10-03
"The positive outlook for insurance stocks doesn't bode well for homeowners who are already suffering from big insurance premium hikes. Same problem for vehicle owners. Rising insurance premiums contribute in a big way to the rising costs of living, especially for the non-wealthy.",2024-10-03
