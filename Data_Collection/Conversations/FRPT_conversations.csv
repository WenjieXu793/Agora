"@Jason Ditz The market does not have to be rational, and often it is not, such as during the pandemic when it ran up to over $180. a share with NO profits in sight and when it was not even a radar blip on the screen.  Today, this is a profitable company with increasing profits into the future.  Even a recession will be unlikely for dog owners to switch out.  The simple truth is dogs love Freshpet and my interviews at the stores that sell it ALWAYS tell me they would feed their dogs nothing else.  Some mix it in to kibble or canned food to save a little money, but presumably some of even these people may end up making it 100% of their dog's diet if the economy holds up.  Pet food is simply recession resistant.Freshpet is a near monopoly in the retail supermarket space, increasing to multiple fridges in many stores due to its popularity.  It not only deserves the multiple, but one MUST ask is the multiple signaling that an acquirer is just around the corner.  If you are a major kibble manufacturer, for every new Freshpet buyer that is one less for kibble.  This kibble manufacturer will just not sit back and watch this happen for much longer.  And the moat around Freshpet is strong.  Stores do not have room for a competitor's fridges and the manufacturers do not need the HUGE expense to build out fridges anew, when they can just acquire Freshpet under their banner.  PLUS, Scott Morris, the co-founder of Freshpet and former COO but still President has ventured out into a separate premium pet food startup (which he correctly got competitive hell over from shareholders for) may just be ready to encourage a sell of Freshpet, so that he can comfortably focus on that new competitive startup, without a deserved prior conflict of interest.All signs look for Freshpet to continue advancing its stock price; I set my own target price long ago at $150, even before a healthy premium when, not if, an acquirer comes knocking.",2024-10-06
