Why recommend DLKwhose payout ratio is ~ 147% ?A payout ratio over 100% indicates that the company is paying out more in dividends than its earnings can support and this could be an unsustainable practice.,2024-09-30
"@jamesy1959 that would be good. . As we all know, beating earnings estimates means a lot.Seemed like they never liked REITs a couple years ago, now they do.Always looked at how your company was going aged in its sector.  They do follow a lot of smaller companies, which I don’t care much about.",2024-09-20
@steve7074 Thank you for the reply. I've mainly been check out the EPS revision grade to see if quant thinks things are trending up or trending down.,2024-09-20
"@jamesy1959 generally that’s due to momentum & earnings adjustments.  Always good when your revenue or earnings get adjusted up.I find quants very useful. They have killed the Market over the years.  Nothing wrong with looking at stocks at the bottom, either.It’s just a tool, but a very useful one.  I don’t get folks who can’t find how useful it is.",2024-09-20
"@Value Digger If you’re going to include small oil companies with safe dividends and fortress balance sheets, why not add $PEYUF and $EGY? Both are great as well. G",2024-09-17
@jamesy1959 Thanks for all the comments guys. I tend to look at the components of the quant and wonder why they show sell when a stock has good scores in the other areas. I'm retired and not trying to invest in the next nivida but rather trying to put together a SWAN portfolio that will give me dividend income. I'm invested currently but always looking to tweak the holdings so I can sleep better at night.,2024-09-17
"@Pinguino Investments maybe that’s it in many articles, really glad to own DIVO.  Great for a retiree, have confidence in Kevin Simpson.   Selling some covered calls helps add to the yield, near 5%.   Total return beats JEPI.( JEPIX) by 2% over 5 years.",2024-09-17
"@steve7074 Oh, sorry, I didn't really pay attention to the ETFs they listed at the end.  I was focused on the ten high-yielding stocks.  As for the ETFs,  I see that they only included the five largest.",2024-09-17
"@Value Digger The list consists of companies with a market cap of at least $1 billion. EPSN's market cap is only $109 million. It may be all the good things you say it is, but it's too small for this list.",2024-09-17
"I believe that Epsilon Energy (EPSN) needs to be included into the list.EPSN offers a safe 5% dividend while maintaining a fortress balance sheet.Additionally, EPSN is grossly undervalued on absolute and relative valuation analysis, so significant capital gains are very likely in the next 12 months.On top of this, EPSN's insiders including the CEO have increased their stake over the last months.",2024-09-17
"@jamesy1959 Make your own decisions, but I find the Quant Ratings to be almost useless. First off, the ratings tend to be backwards looking. Even the momentum component focuses on what's already happened. Secondly, I have no idea who the quaint analysts are. If they are anything like many SA authors, you don't want to pay much attention to them. If they were any good, they'd be working for real investment banks.",2024-09-17
"I own No.9 and No.10. If you’re looking for yield, you can’t go wrong with either MAIN or KNTK. G",2024-09-17
"@Pinguino Investments SCHD & VYM don’t have yields of 5%, closer to 3%, DIVO is almost 5%.",2024-09-16
MAIN and OHI are proven survivors and worth an investment at the right price. IMHO,2024-09-16
@jamesy1959 I find quant a fantastic tool for understanding what the stock has done over the previous 2 quarters.,2024-09-16
@jamesy1959  It’s mostly influenced by the momentum of the stock.  Personally I did not find it useful for my more conservative / value approach to investing.  Those stocks often rate very low on their Quant score.,2024-09-16
"WBA.  Yes pharmacies are closing as benefit managers ruin their business model but in WBA you get Boots - a UK chain of ""chemists"" that do not have to worry about these issues.  At current valuation, this asset is free and making decent profits:Boots UK comparable retail sales increased 5.9 percent compared to the year-ago quarter with growth across all categories, and increased total retail market share. Boots.com continued to perform strongly with sales growing 16.8 percent representing over 17 percent of Boots total retail sales.Adjusted operating income decreased 30.3 percent to $245 million, a decrease of 32.4 percent on a constant currency basis compared with the year-ago quarter, entirely due to lapping real estate gains in the year-ago period. Underlying growth offset inflationary pressures.",2024-09-16
Love my PDM shares.  10% of my portfolio is in that stock.  Still got a long way to grow while paying a nice dividend.,2024-09-16
@Michael401981virgo unless your broker was Schwab and you couldn’t get in.,2024-09-16
"@steve7074 For this list, they set the minimum dividend yield at five percent.",2024-09-16
