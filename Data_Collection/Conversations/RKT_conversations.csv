Business is about to pickup at RKT with cuts ahead......,2024-09-27
"At $6, the market gave a very attractive entry point to buyers. At the current $20, it reflects the sentiment that interest rates will continue to decline. At $40B it has quite a valuation. But they have shown that they can return significant capital to investors so i can get on board with the thesis. I'm not buying here but I the company is of high quality IMO.",2024-09-27
"I hope you're right.  I'm long.I don't usually buy high valuation stuff, but I like the thesis here.  I'm just not sure how much earnings growth is already priced into this as it has run up quite a bit. Mortgage refis are picking up and, since i expect rates to keep falling, I expect long rates to eventually cooperate and continue to induce refis.  I've been in in January $15 calls for about 2 months.  I should probably roll these out... but we'll see.",2024-09-26
