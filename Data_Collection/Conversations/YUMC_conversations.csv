I realized that I held onto a small position in YUMC as a canary in the mine shaft of Chinese consumers sentiment.  I understand today's move on the generous desperate buy order from the Central Bank is akin to comfort food for starving Chinese ADR holders.  But this financial engineering will likely have a short afterlife since the underlying weakness of consumer sentiment is likely to overpower the short term boost while a long term fix is still not in the cards.So I'll set a GTC sell at a slightly higher price and try to escape without a loss.,2024-09-26
"@Z Hu good luck...I've been a YUMC investor for several years...traded out near its peak, but jumped back in a little too early.  very savvy mgmt and the expansion potential is YUGE !",2024-09-24
"@tbone hi!, I started averaging into YUMC when it moved below $35 but my last put at $30 didn't strike. I just sold to open a covered call on my position to strike at $40, Oct 4th. I completely missed out on the other Chinese stocks... Oh well, I do have some exposure with TCEHY, but not a lot. China has a long ways to go before their out of the woods. Just waiting for the next down cycle to average into the usual, i.e. BABA, JD and PDD.As for MPW, you could buy calls at $7 for just pennies, the timeframe on the other hand, that's the tricky one.",2024-09-24
@Three Mile Research can't assume that the economy in China will remain depressed forever.  this is a very well run firm that has only begun to scratch the surface in penetrating China's secondary cities.  Huge potential for location expansion.  also note that pre-covid the firm was steadily improving operating margins.  Post covid they have not yet achieved peak margins.,2024-09-24
"@Deep Value Investing very well run firm that is only now starting to scratch the surface of penetrating China's secondary cities.  Note that the firm was steadily improving operating margins until Covid hit.  Now they thave not yet returned to pre-covid operating margins.  Room to run there !  Wouldn't add until this pulls back...but when it does, its a buy !",2024-09-24
