@sgonza33 What is an SOC? I don't know anything about $CRMD but will look into it. I believe that $AQST will outperform the market.,2024-10-06

"@PaisleyPark What do previous prices have to do with anything?The business' cashflows have stagnated for years despite the top line growth as margins have consistently narrowed.The higher the valuation, the more buybacks management does... the norm in US equities, always backwards.Cashflow margin was 1.3% in FY24 (after years of contraction) and 75% gas been distributed through buybacks lately: at the current 63b market cap, that represents a 4% yield.Prior to 2020, cashflows were directed towards acquisitions, so only 40% was left available for buybacks, or a 2% yield.So at the current valuation we are left with a 2-4% buyback yield (depending on the growth strategy going forward), and potentially 5-6% growth (assuming the margin deterioration stops).Also, at a 63b market cap this trades at 18x cashflows: from 2017 through 2021 this traded at 5-7x, likely as a result of the perceived Amazon threat and the realized margin compression.So plenty of risk for single digit business reward.",2024-10-06
Clov seems good. New 4 star rating coming out Oct. 10.,2024-10-06
$CRMD & $AQST top notch picks. New SOCs in the making.,2024-10-06
Very informative.  You have to believe that CLOV cash flow and earnings will continue to grow as their new business model matures.  The easy money is made now not when the model has proven itself.  Management is telling you that there is still much runway left given insider purchase.  Time will tell.,2024-10-06
"I note that the company has a high rating on SA's quant program.  Still, it is in just a handful of states (6?) and is a Rivian in a field dominated by multiple Teslas.  I did see a mention that it serves mostly rural markets and those are often areas where prices are higher but the admin expense is spread among far fewer enrollees.",2024-10-04
"@VEEZAA data leak suggesting that CLOV has a new 4 star rating through the Medicare healthcare selection process for elderly persons. Data leak also highlights how Humana dropped to a 3 star from a 4 star, causing its stock price fall being near identical to CLOV’s rise. Data leak has been confirmed through various means, but will be ultimately confirmed on OCT. 10th, when star ratings are officially released.",2024-10-04
"Important to mention: the stock is becoming more and more popular with the meme stock portion of reddit. I expect volatility to increase. While tempting, still, I don't see the valuation as cheap, so I would advise investors that want to trade it to keep it in the risky portion of the porftolio and expect huge swings in either direction.",2024-10-03
"@LongerBurger Part of the strategy. Less members, but focus on those who make a profit. Makes sense to me.",2024-10-03

@Blueblack Yesterday up 29%. Any news or is this normal volatility with CLOV? I´m a new shareholder and haven´t really followed the stock before.,2024-10-03
