Altimmune (ALT) is another company that is preserving muscle mass with a similar weight loss drug.  Needs to get Phase 3 going I believe.,2024-10-06
$ATL is the solution same result but less lean body mass and less muscle lost,2024-10-06

"@HPBunker What a concept...citizen level budgeting for the gov't.Mr. Bunker, you will pay your taxes but if you get to pick and choose where the taxes go then I get the same option. Fortunately it isn't the way it works. It just isn't up to you.Toodles!",2024-10-06
"Please note in the article “Regenerom (REGN) is testing a drug called trevogrumab that blocks the hormone myostatin, preventing from limiting muscle growth”They are developing a muscle building drug…To combine with obesity Drugs A muscle building drug would tremendously benefit the elderly, who lose muscle mass with age A muscle building drug would help bedridden patients Are the objections as loud to this application of a life enhancing drug?If it also Induces weight loss because muscles burn more calories, should it be banned?Benefits now equal cost benefits later JMHO",2024-10-06
"@HPBunker Actually the two would be combined for initial weight loss, after weight loss, a low dose maintenance dose will likely be the end point Lilly is studying that now, in conjunction with long term benefits to weight loss resulting from using Zepbound The point being, obesity, now defined as 25 lbs overweight Not the 500 lbs person brought to mind by that termEventually brings on heart disease, diabetes, kidney failure, joint replacement etcIt’s better and cheaper to pay for obesity drugs than the above  JMHO",2024-10-06
"Eli Lilly sells Zepbound, two lowest doses) directly for about 400 $ a month The (shots with a needle!) are, in reality, an injector pen with microscopic needles, the patient does NOT even SEE a needle and barely feels it  Once a week is easier to remember than dailyPatients using Zepbound have had fewer side effects due to single dose device and stepped up one month regimen A single dose in one injector pen isn’t subject to the abuse of a pen and vial, the common way of getting off label untested compounded drugs off the internet (also Novo)Needles and vials allow impatient Patients to inject higher doses of Untested Compounded drugs which of course causes side effects  There’s no way Of knowing how Unhappy patients ATE or drank while using glp drigs Before criticizing weight loss drugs, please consider that Prescribed drugs cause over 100,000 deaths a year in the USA It’s likely that obesity causes Many More deaths a year than that… certainly more than deaths from tested, injected obesity drugs  A maintenance dose of tested obesity drugs, like a statin, will likely evolve as an effective way to retain weight loss  (Lilly is testing that now)The Puritan view that using drugs to enhance lifestyles should have died with the advent of ViagraJMHO",2024-10-06
Increasing muscle mass alone would burn calories  For older people who Lose Muscle As a Function of Age … Such a drug would be a huge benefit  A drug that would combine with glp drugs to prevent muscle loss would be wonderful With the advent of Viagra… the Puritan view that using drugs to enhance people’s lives should have had a stake driven through its heartThe health costs benefits flowing from weight loss compensate for the costs of the tested and approved drugs  Once weight loss is achieved… a maintenance dose to retain weight loss will likely be what evolves  Something akin to a statinJMHO,2024-10-06
"The GLP-1 drugs have many negatives, which is a key tailwind for Medifast's (MED) business. Again.MED's business has to do with healthy lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, that have PERMANENT results without side effects. Specifically, the negatives of the GLP-1 drugs are:1) The GLP-1 drugs do NOT manage weight through changes to one's lifestyle and behavior. As a result, patients who lost weight while on these medications gain the weight back once they stop taking them.2) The GLP-1 drugs have side effects, some of which are severe. Add this one mentioned above by REGN's CEO.3) The GLP-1 drugs do NOT come cheap. Specifically, based on GoodRx website, the annual use of Wegovy costs about $20K, and the annual use of Ozempic costs about $12K.4) Insurance will NOT cover the cost of the GLP-1 drugs in many cases. The reason is that the patient who seeks insurance coverage must prove that he has fulfilled many conditions required by the insurer and that the patient has made reasonable efforts to try other treatment methods or lifestyle changes prior to using them.5) The GLP-1 drugs are NOT available over the counter. They can only be given upon a prescription by a doctor, so if a person is NOT diabetic that individual should NOT be receiving any prescription to buy the medication.6) The GLP-1 drugs are INJECTABLE medications, meaning you inject a liquid medication with a needle and syringe, which is NOT convenient for many people.",2024-10-06
"As a long time believer in REGN, I wait patiently for momentum to develop behind Libtayo, but so far, it seems only slow and steady progress, esp. vs the giant steps MRK is taking to totally dominate the relevant indications with Keytruda. I suspect this may have a lot to do with REGN trying to do the 'go to market' efforts on its own, whereas it worked so successfully with Bayer and Sanofi on its other leading drugs like Eylea, Dupixent and Praluent. They seem to have signed up with a Swiss-based drug company called Medison Pharma in this effort, but this name is literally unheard of anywhere, esp. key oncology markets in Europe, Asia and Latam. I wonder why?If momentum is not built soon, I worry key patent cliffs are soon coming their way.",2024-10-05
What about LLY's Mounjaro when will that get on this list?,2024-09-30
"I have owned a small position in REGN, since 2017, CB of 360. Sold 30% in 2020 for around 600, sold another 30% in early 2024 for 830. The remaining 40%, I am quite content to let run. With 20/20 hindsight, I probably should have held all the shares but things can shift quickly in BioTech. So I took some profits and I have some shares to participate in further upside.  If we have a sharp correction, maybe the most anticipated recession that hasn't arrived, I would add some shares. The IP & pipeline appear to be very strong and the company looks like a good long term investment.",2024-09-29
"Anton,Appreciate your article and perspective, although I have a much different view of Regeneron. The “expectation of weaker numbers in the future” is possible, however my belief is that the company will continue to continue surprise analysts to the upside given their conservative projections.None of the analysts expected Dupixent to be a blockbuster drug many years ago, and that’s not their job.  As long term biotech investors, not traders, we need conviction and belief that management will continue to grow revenues and value thru innovation.  IMO, Regeneron has shown they are one of the best, and will continue to exceed expectations with their IP and pipeline.As you noted, there is very little downside risk, and my view is that the current valuation offers an asymmetrical  opportunity to new investors, while existing shareholders of Regeneron will continue to benefit for years to come!",2024-09-29
I've owned REGN for well over 5 years. I have done well biu am not currently adding.,2024-09-29
@PauloCostaSilva Yes and was expecting a nice pop with the price too!,2024-09-27
"A  potential future  competitor to eylea HD is 4D-150, which is an intravitreal gene therapy injection into the eyeball for wet amd from 4d molecular therapeutics (FDMT)...   this gene therapy (not yet approved)  from FDMT has a longer duration of action compared to eylea HD,  which means less injections into the eyeball per year when using 4D-150.",2024-09-26
"Myriam - thanks for an excellent article and I agree with your perspective.  REGN is a world class leader and innovator in biotech, and IMO, their pipeline is under appreciated on the Street.  Agree this Amgen ruling is an over-reaction and REGN’s long term prospects are very bright!",2024-09-25
Great article!  Indeed I did manage to purchase a few more shares this morning!,2024-09-25
Ready to buy more below 1000. Bought yesterday after the accumulated -14% in the last 30 days. Behemoth that's on sale and people still can't get it.,2024-09-25
@PauloCostaSilva Thanks for following me.  As the SA community knows I've owned VRTX and REGN for many many years and believe both have solid futures.  I do not follow AXSM or Roche.Slow and steady!  Continued good luck to you!,2024-09-24
