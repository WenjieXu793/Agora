"@OldCurmudgeon This may take time, but I think there is a good chance the merger will go through.  I think that no matter who wins the election, the FTC is going to become more merger friendly.  Kahn will be gone and I believe that the Democrats will even be pushed (primarily by tech) for a more merger friendly agency.  The FTC may want to argue that Kroger is ""different"" from competitors like Walmart but most people (not associated with the FTC or some consumer group) looking at it objectively would say that argument is absolutely ridiculous.  Furthermore, there are probably viable options for divestitures that could make the deal work.  That being said, the approval time element is a big negative.  As such I am selling the 10/18 ACI $18 puts which are currently yielding a 66% annualized return if they expire worthless.  If I become a shareholder from those puts, my cost basis would be about $17.30 and i would look to enhance the return by selling calls.",2024-09-27
"@Gentleman Argentum it is easier to not argue Amazon about anything because Walmart as a business model faces litigation as a given WHERE NOW it is obvious that Amazon as a WHAT EXACTLY....does not. What exactly is Amazon should be obvious, and what of Walmart and Kroger etc may be the direct proof and therefore needs to exist in order to justify what Amazon laughably is not. Amazon a monopoly? Why.... Walmart harder to ATTACK than Kroger is the simple obvious proof that Amazon can never be a monopoly except with tin foil hatters and conspiracy theorists. I guess it can therefore be said that Walmart is rightfully compensatory intrusively and Amazon beautifully blends in to any background....I can only imagine the rather dark and dingy prospects of a 24hour self automated Amazon convenience store future, no different than seeing now, the garbage ladened Tesla charging stations where even in the bright of day and next to a Mall and B of A....plug in cables lavishly strewning the parking lot asphalt in a modern day UNABSTRACT artful kind of way....",2024-09-18

"@LenceFlatu Yes, and and they closed all their stores in my area.",2024-09-18
@Tommcma Oh there's soo many times from Office Max to Milk producers and so forth these blocks are all political and hurt business and thus the consumer.This merger absolutely should be allowed.,2024-09-17
"Rite Aid exited BK no problem. *""Franken-Food""* people have some serious issues in the head better off sticking with non alcoholic beverage market for North America until Congress starts properly vetting whether any food currently being put forward as such for sale anywhere in any major chain is safe for consumption.",2024-09-17
"@Tommcma I shop at neither, but know that Amazon is their big competitor. Amazon is a lot bigger than they are. It is hard to argue they have a monopoly, it is easier to argue that Amazon does.",2024-09-17
It is very risky but I believe the merger needs to happen. The FTC blocked drugstore mergers and now they are all cutting back. Rite Aid even went bankrupt. Government runs the government not businesses.,2024-09-17
"@OldCurmudgeon If the case leads to a series of injunctions, it will take a long time for this merger to get resolved-one way or another. The level of opposition SEEMS to easily TRUMP financial logic.In the current POLITICAL climate of this country, EMOTION will defeat financial LOGIC almost every time.",2024-09-15
"@William Cohen Let's not kid ourselves here. This proposed merger is a bad deal for consumers, as well as a bad deal for employees. Only shareholders benefit.""Let me educate you. Shareholders OWN the business. And, of course, lots of employees are shareholders, too. A company that is a financially stronger entity is more able to compete effectively. The competition in this space is predominantly non-union, so this helps make union jobs safer, and there will ultimately be more of them.True capitalism wins every time. Those who put their capital at risk deserve the rewards. Personally, I took a huge risk, and am even buying more shares to hedge my bets against possible outcomes. The courts should not screw shareholders preemptively in ANTICIPATION of a crime-that is not the American way.Just look at the financial heft of the other top competitors in the space. The case against the merger is an ""argumentum ad absurdum."" The FTC DESERVES to lose!!",2024-09-15
@Socrates9 - why are they sending you an invoice via email?  Haven't they heard of email?,2024-09-15
@blackwhiteswanbuildscastle Of course you are correct. That will greatly reduce competition. But even if that were a possibility [it isn't likely] the FTC is still determined to joust with its imaginary windmills. The FTC is Don Quixote writ large.,2024-09-15
"@David RG I am buying more Albertsons stock. It is not going anywhere, and it is undervalued. If the merger goes through, I make money, and if it doesn't, I could make even more.ACI will get a $600,000,000 breakup fee if the merger does not go through. Bankruptcy is not likely.",2024-09-15
"Let's not kid ourselves here.  This proposed merger is a bad deal for consumers, as well as a bad deal for employees.  Only shareholders benefit.There are recordings of conversations between industry executives gloating about this fact, and even admitting that the stores to be spun off are ""dogs"", and that they raised prices more than necessary to boost profitability.  In light of this evidence, I can't see the judge buying the notion that this merger will result in lower prices, better selection, etc.  In fact, quite the opposite is true.We saw what happened when Safeway and Albertsons merged in 2014...stores which were located near other locations were closed, prices increased, selection decreased, and a small number of stores were sold to Hagen, which ended up going bankrupt.  Those stores then reverted back to Safeway and Albertsons.",2024-09-14
"@Socrates9 I don't use it but my GF sends money to her kids using Zelle, which is owned by a consortium of large banks.  Z doesn't charge fees for sending money though not all banks use it.This is promo info from US Bank:Zelle lets you send, receive and request money with your trusted customers and eligible vendors. If your customer uses Zelle through their financial institution, they can send payments directly to your U.S. Bank account. Simply provide them with your email address or United States mobile number. The money will be withdrawn from their account and deposited into your account within minutes.Zelle is available to consumers at over 2,000 financial institutions.",2024-09-14
"@OldCurmudgeon Well, I think that if the Feds don't choose to stop the case, the states will have a much harder time stopping it. If this merger is stopped, it is really going to weaken other companies in the future who want to merge to enhance their financial viability. Spirit airlines has already been all but killed by the FTC. That organization is really becoming problematic, as it is causing many companies to make huge legal outlays just to TRY to get past the Feds. That is a losing battle, unless you have very deep pockets.",2024-09-14
"@Socrates9 they could send an email with the bill and then you can setup billpay with your bank. Or if the bill is the same amount every month, just setup the billpay to pay automatically.",2024-09-14
@Skagit I almost don’t care if they have a branch anymore. I know if I have a real issue I will have to drive across town to one with a real manager or someone with authority to fix problems. Only a few branches seem to have anyone in them anymore that can solve an actual problem. Most are just branches with some tellers and a floating manager that’s usually not there. Banking is not what it was for anyone anymore.,2024-09-14
"@vmg I know this entire subject here is off topic but it hit such a nerve with me I had to comment. It just took 11 days to get a letter from 4 miles away with USPS and they charge what, $0.75 for that service now after their most recent in a slew of rate hikes? This type of thing happens regularly now and the same person sends me mail every month (I should say invoice) and it’s gone from overnight to over a week in the last decade or so. This means sometimes half the time I have to pay the bill is used up in transit or rather sitting in a post office. Now if I don’t stick a payment in the mail practically the day I get the invoice I cannot be assured they will get it on time. This persons business is too small to setup an online payment solution so they say they are stuck but I would have no issue if they did. I wouldn’t trust USPS to deliver my payments anymore if it were free. Not to mention the majority of people check their accounts online at least once a month and could arrange a payment at that time. Mailing paper statements is a huge cost item to have and a no brainer to reduce if running a bank. Postage has just about doubled in the last few years while there service went down the drain. But just my two cents.",2024-09-14
"@Fergie20t That's hard to say, but not anytime soon. I don't know how many state attorneys general have sued to block the merger, but I know the case in Colorado is viewed as sufficiently strong that the judge issued an injunction (which is only granted when the plaintiff shows a reasonable likelihood of success at trial).  And that's without considering the FTC.  As the author pointed out, when Albertsons acquired Safeway, they ""divested"" certain stores but sold them to a financially crippled company that enabled them to re-acquire the stores a short time later.  That sleight-of-hand is not going to help Kroger and Albertsons in court proceedings this time around.  I live mostly in Denver but also in San Diego, which are two cities where the chief grocery competition is Kroger (Denver: King Soopers; San Diego: Ralph's) and Albertson's (Denver: Safeway; San Diego: Von's).  (Yes, yes, I know about Walmart, Costco and Target. They're not the same as supermarkets.) I haven't been following California's response to the proposed merger, but I've been following the Colorado case.  The case is framed as one that would hurt consumers, employees, and farmers.  I feel there's some pretty heavy lifting for the grocery stores to win this case, and it's certain to be tied up for quite some time.  I wouldn't count on this merger happening - if at all - before 2026.",2024-09-14
