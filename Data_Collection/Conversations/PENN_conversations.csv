"@Noah's Arc Capital Management All this could be very well true. I think GLPI if I have this correct, put up a decent amount of money to help with their new casinos. There was another great slide Penn put out showing how well they performed during the GFC. I'm not sold on the ESPN deal and think BYD has it figured out on the better business model. Penn has better assets in their regional casinos imo. Hoping BYD figures out a way to buy them",2024-09-24
@andrewtg41 Thanks for the feedback I appreciate it. I thought about that as we were writing this. The only reason I kept it is because we are seeing these royalty payments to Disney for the ESPN deal. It all comes out of the same bucket of money and are expenses. I did not get into this too much but they may have overbuilt their physical casino real estate,2024-09-24
"Good article but I am going to push back on the debt you provided. I think you are blowing that out of proportion because the capital leases is a normal business expense that they have paid even during the financial crisis. I think you need to separate the two and analyze them separately. The traditional debt is very well laddered and can easily be pushed, if need be, especially with rates coming down.",2024-09-24
$35 Billion in legal bets and estimated illegal bets of around $500 Billion. Legal betting is slowly catching up. :-),2024-09-14

"Does Barry the ceo of PSEC have to buy more shares every single day???? He was rude to the shareolders at the Conf call and even though the news was good - he gave many shareholders attitude.  I can whine cause i bought a bunch at $4.75-85 but I planned on buying even more.  Everytime I set a price Barry comes in and buys more and literally millions.  This guy is something else, not sure I've seen anything like it in over 50 years of investing.  I'd love to be able to call him and ask if he plans to stop but I over-react to rude people.",2024-09-12
