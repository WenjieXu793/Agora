"Natural gas for fueling everything continues to dominate the US energy mix over both oil and coal and most definitely is not a bridge fuel if hydrogen fuel cells start to recover in the USA. As well methane still very much the Next Rocket Fuel for the entire burgeoning space launch Industry in the USA. This matters greatly to all pipeline operators in the USA as monitoring these crazy complex systems is a crazy hard job as well whether natural gas, oil or refined product plus specialty product so having monitoring equipment such as that to follow how a rocket is performing prior to launch matters immensely to the massive USA pipeline as logistics industry. As well a robust energy grid which combined cycle very much supports makes $kmi very much possibly a transformative play for the US economy again being a rocket fuel supplier but also a supplier for commercial trucks powered by natural gas instead of diesel fuel.  The current price for natural gas is obviously materially higher greatly aiding $kmi et al but the current price is still very low by historical standards as well at least in 2008.",2024-10-04
"@Jafopt If ""bad"" for the environment means non-zero impact, then yes, every energy solution is ""bad"", even fusion energy. As a wise person once said: ""There are no solutions, only trade-offs"". The question we need to ask is: Are renewables better than oil and coal? Windmills are not our best solution, but they are still much better than oil and coal. Solar, is vastly better, and so cheap that even the most die-hard can't ignore the price advantages, even over cheap natural gas. Should they be careful about where they put them (e.g. deserts with wildlife)? Absolutely. If it were up to me they would put them on top of every large parking lot in the country. Nothing but a few insects there.Nuclear would be good, but it takes a ton of money and way to long to build them. Then there's the waste storage problem. If those small modular reactors that I keep hearing about actually start taking off, and they develop a sane policy and procedure for disposal and storage of the waste I would be on-board.",2024-10-04
This stock is getting frothy.  There is not much upside here at this point and plenty of downside.,2024-10-03
"This has been a nice surprise this run up.   Have held for a long time as a cashflow play.  But now have excellent cap gains.   To capture some I am looking at selling $24 cc in Nov.  ex div date is around 10/31, which lowers stock price.  So in effect that would be $1 upside from here plus premium.  Earnings mid Oct and could go either way.    I own at $14.20 and have collected $16.8k in dividends to date, so net of divs I own below $10 if look at it in that way. I used to say this a de facto bond, but this recent move has changed that at least ytd.  But I can see it going back to its previous trends.  If I get called at $24, I would have no issue.  Move on to next idea.",2024-10-03
"@Jafopt Bumper stickers are perfect for this day and age of blind partisanship and gross oversimplification of issues.How about pro-pipeline for now, but also pro moving towards renewables as much and as quickly as is feasible (and that we may never get to zero oil)? Long $KMI for the medium term and long $BEPC for the long term?",2024-10-02
"Despite the false narrative of trump and the republicans, as I have been writing on Seeking Alpha for a few years now: we live in a ""New Age of Energy Abundance"" and the U.S. is energy independent (by an estimated ~3 million boe/d) and is the #1 petroleum producer on the planet and the #1 LNG exporter on the planet. This is one reason the XLE Energy ETF is one of the worst performing sector ETFs over the past decade (if not the worst ...) and if it wasn't for Putin & Netanyahu's wars, the results would have been even worst, and likely significantly so. Meantime, note the American ""big-3"" (Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips) aren't making any significant investments in wind, solar, and battery backup capacity. As a result, they are increasingly ill-prepared for the 21st Century of electrification and they are increasingly contributing to global warming, and we saw the results of that with the horrific recent hurricane that laid waste to so much of the Southeastern U.S. and took more than 100 lives.There is no way the planet will stop burning up as long as the ""Big-3"" (little 3?) refused to invest some of their cash-flow directly into renewables. Further, the supposed ""carbon sequestration"" is a total disaster, ineffective, and waste of time, money, and resources. What a world!",2024-10-02
"@arete_builders I'm going to guess there are companies that treat investors badly (yes you could be right concerning ET).  However, as far as I'm concerned with ET, that kind of return being up 119% please throw me into that briar patch.",2024-09-28
"@Jafopt Thats a little misleading.  Tesla sells more than 2/3 of its cars in the US & Europe. Europe: 16% coal, 20% gas, 22% nukes, 40% renewableUS:   40% gas, 16% coal, 19% nuke, 20% renewables.Coal use is heavily weighted to 3rd world countries...which (other than China) aren't using it to power cars.",2024-09-28
"@Jafopt There was the big cut in 2020.  They just recouped all of that early last year.  Then there was the stealth cut in the ETE rollup in 2015.  And the cut before that in 2013 that was a warning sign I missed.www.nasdaq.com/...For me, its a lot less about the returns than it is about the risk of a criminal CEO like Kelcey Warren run an operation of this magnitude.I sold all my ET for a loss after I read the decision from the Williams lawsuit.  KW is the least ethical person in the entire midstream space...and probably in any C-Suite anywhere.  Total and complete scumbag...ET could return 100%+ for the next decade & I wouldn't touch that con man with a 10 ft pole.I always wondered how con men could keep getting away with running scam after scam.  But after watching Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Kelcey Warren get away with it repeatedly, it's starting to become clear.Anyway, it's all about ethics, not really about returns.",2024-09-28
"@arete_builders I’m still recovering from KMIs corporate structure change 6-8 years ago.  The only period I can find KMI besting ET is TTM.  I’m interested in your ET data because I own that for my wife.  Any info, links, are much appreciated.",2024-09-27
@Jafopt Electric vehicles (I'm assuming thats what the bumper sticker means) run mostly on natural gas.,2024-09-25
"@ndardick ET has a long history of treating its unit holders badly.  Sure, it's cheaper, but for a reason.I sleep a lot better at night having sold my ET & moved it to better managed, more shareholder friendly midstream operators like KMI and ENB.",2024-09-25
@Zvi Bar I have a bunch of Jan 20's!!!Short some Oct 22 against and looking to roll those to Nov 23s......Trying not to get too greedy.   Good luck.,2024-09-23
"@bqdoo I am long calls. Had some Oct $21s and rolled 60% into $22s. Will roll the rest if it pops more and then may consider selling puts on on down days, but for now I am just in those calls for earnings week. May sell them on earnings day for max implied volatility.",2024-09-23
"@ndardick EPD is also my largest position, MPLX is great and the other are solid as well. I just wrote about ET which I may add to considering that its distribution coverage has grown...",2024-09-19
@Bucknfl And I can see stronger dividend growth in the future :),2024-09-19
@ndardick I just don't see where EPD compared to KMI is better overall when you take into considerations dividends and capital gains.  I certainly can go along with you on MPLX and ENB which I don't own but have been following for a short period of time and my inkling is MPLX as a buy.  As for ET and KMI my profit as of today are119% on ET and 111% on KMI.  Missed buying more ET today but we'll see what the next few days bring.  As per se I always enjoy and learn from you concerning investments.  You ramp up my old noggin. Thanks,2024-09-19
"KMI woke up about a year ago, the one year chart looks good.",2024-09-18
"Good coverage of KMI, which is always on my watch list. Midstream pipelines represent over 10% of the total portfolio value in our family's main account, so obviously I agree with you.But I also agree with you when you point out that ET trades at a lower Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio than KMI, and further agree when you point out the following:""Kinder Morgan is still managing to grow its dividend… but is not able to do so as fast as Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) or Enbridge (ENB).""Accordingly, I have chosen to own EPD, ET, MPLX and ENB, in order of size, instead of KMI in the midstream pipeline space.",2024-09-18
My only comment here is that this was a very good article on KMI.,2024-09-18
