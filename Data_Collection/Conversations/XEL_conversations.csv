"@Valuestocks007 : I have owned it since 1986.... so 38 years. My grandmother gave us 25 shares back then and I dripped it until 2010. I added a few shares to round it out and now hold 1200. I never really asked my Nana when she bought it, but when she died at age 102 she owned it and gave it to my parents.",2024-09-30

"AI is energy hungry so are electric cars on apartments, no solar or wind on those.   The Three Mile Island reactor is being reactivated by MSFT.  In the Future Utilities such as the one here stand to gain.  The world needs all the energy it can get and until Hydrogen or we make cold fusion or in 200 years a Dyson Sphere is viable in an economical manner. The world  will have to depend on a Mix of oil, gas, carbon, nuclear, wind, water and solar.  Any new alternative with less implications welcome!",2024-09-29
