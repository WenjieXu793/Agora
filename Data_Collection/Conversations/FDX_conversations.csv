@sgossett I too have been amazed by the run. It was an F on valuation from Schwab at $290,2024-10-03
"AXON is a trump trade. Over 150x P/EBITDA, I think around 100 P/E... worth 3 times Nividia? Give me a break. This is a total meme stock by now. It's actually quite frustrating. I bought puts on it with 12% of my portfolio and it has went up since the strike.. insanity. Just goes to show not to mess with meme stocks. At least I've made 40% on my portfolio with vix calls for the strike. I learned a serious lesson from this AXON trade and my past CVNA puts.",2024-10-01
"After 6 consecutive negative quarter growth, they actually closed in positive territory in this quarter.Considering cost cuttings, i think it is good long term investment.Pe is in the range of last years.So whatever they save plus growth goes to your pocket as long as they keep their promises.",2024-10-01
"@Ray Merola The problem with China is that they can build all the stuff they want, but Americans are broke, and choked up to the limits on their credit cards. So they are not going to be buying Chinese made junk. They will try to make it to the end of the month just buying food and buying gasoline to get to work. They can't even afford to go out and eat anymore. We already are in a recession, just that the government doesn't call it till we are deep in it or already come out of it. The FED will have to cut interest rates to almost zero again so that the federal government can pay the interest on the 35 trillion dollar debt. Meanwhile inflation won't come down that much and prices will stay high.I retired after working for FDX for 26 years, but I wasn't on the airline side of the business, or the part that is remaining.",2024-09-28
"@River18 FedEx is a cyclical industrial corporation.  The business rides the ups and downs of the economic cycle.  If an investor seeks a secular growth company, FedEx isn't a great option.  I believe the U.S. and Europe may not fall into a recession.  China will provide stimulus to keep its economy intact.  Therefore, under that premise FedEx is a good investment.  Could that premise be wrong?  Sure.  The U.S. may crater.  China real estate could lead to an economic collapse.  Cyclicals always entail a level of risk.",2024-09-27
@Ray Merola FDX is a well run company.Still FDX is at the mercy of China slowing down. Europe and the US going into a recession. So demand for Express service will suffer as business slows down and tries to save on shipping costs.Even FedEx Freight can see some drop in shipping volumes if freight levels remain soft.,2024-09-27
"FedEx stock took a big hit after the recent earnings miss.  FDX fell to ~$253.  Since then, shares have been working their way back up.  Currently, FDX is sitting at $268 and the 40-week moving average is $267.  A hold above that level is positive.Currently, if one believes the long-term business remains sound, current bids are good for doing the due diligence and considering a position.The margin decline was the most troublesome issue.  However, management guidance indicates a rebound in upcoming quarters.Personally, after this report, my FVE is a bit lower based upon a turn lower on valuation multiples.  This reflects a ""show me"" view of the forecast cost savings and Express package recovery.  My current FVE is ~$305.  As succeeding quarterly results come in, I continue to adjust my FVE to reflect forward expectations and reasonable valuation multiples.",2024-09-27
@chip maker I think they fact that Fed Ex isn't unionized helps.,2024-09-25
The stock has rallied back right up to it's 200-day moving average. Let's see if it can stabilize around this level. Doubt that it would trade below $250 or the 200-week moving average unless there was a serious issue.,2024-09-25
@FearGreedy FDX is certainly a cyclical stock that will be adversely impacted by an economic downturn.,2024-09-24
"@ndardick I don't think we will have a recession. In 2022, when FDX crashed, everything crashed a few months later. In 2024, FDX crashed on September 20th—do you think the same thing will happen again?”",2024-09-24
"@FearGreedy I demur. UPS and FDX both recently reported and guided, and I think each is already trading on its own merits and prospects. Yet, I do look forward to seeing what UPS reports next around October 24.",2024-09-24
Guys don't buy FDX unitl UPS's earnings.. It will drag FDX to $220.,2024-09-24
"@Brian Gilmartin, CFA Thanks for your reply. I recently bought UPS as a trade, while I enjoy the nice dividend for a while. I have a high conviction on AMZN for the long term.",2024-09-24
"@ndardick UPS was hurt by the latest union contract. At least that was Carol Tome's (CEO) viewpoint. FedEx lost the USPS contract that was not a real surprise to my knowledge. The USPS contract was getting scaled down over the last few years. Amazon is a formidable competitor to both UPS and FedEx, but e-commerce continues to grow and as a percentage of retail is far from saturated. That's my take.",2024-09-24
Good coverage of FDX.I have two questions:1. Do you have a view on UPS?2. Do you have a view of the competitive landscape for FDX that includes not only UPS but USPS and Amazon?,2024-09-24
I'll wait as I did in 2022 for a small miss and a price drop to $150. I sold at $294. I'll wait for the market to trounce the company again with another knee j-rk reaction as the market does w/ any minor deviation from expectations of any company.,2024-09-24
"@WhiteIverson1 I'm not qualified to say.  As I discuss above, I mostly just look at what analysts say.  Even with the horrible 2q eps, anaylysts think they will earn $23.10 in f25 and something like $25 the next year.  They, the people who study this company, see growing earnings, so I presume they also see growing revenues.  One other point, I thought years ago that UPS and FDX would benefit from e-commerce, even if AMZN has their own network.  I try to own companies who are benefiting from current trends.  For example, I love REITs but own no office REITs, as I expect WFH to continue.  I own VST, as I expect the appetite for power will continue to grow.  I think FDX is in a good industry right now.",2024-09-23
@FearGreedy I am watching UPS which dropped on earns and has no recovery.  FDX report was much worse than UPS.  Also FDX was $150 10/22.  So drop may continue despite todays minor bounce,2024-09-23
@momo11 people have less money than they did 6 years ago...,2024-09-23
