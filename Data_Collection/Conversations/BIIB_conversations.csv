"Biogen kind of reminds me of where Gilead was a few years ago, much smaller of course.  Biogen's market cap has shrunk, and they have a new CEO, who appears to have the company pointed in the right direction.  Like Gilead, I fully expect a slow turnaround here for this midcap biotech.  My personal FV is closer to $300, which suggest close to 55% upside from today's price.  An investment here must be considered a turnaround holding and patience is of the utmost importance.

"@dsbodart you have probably hit the bullseye of how democrats expect to deal with spending and the national debt. It was media tested by Zeke Emmanuel and like minded lunatics and why he got appointed as head of Medicare a few years ago. He too believes that “you’ve had a good life, you’ve done all you wanted to do;” now you can do what is good for the society and essential euthanize yourself and it’s not too far a stretch that if you don’t take yourself out at say 75 that their friends in state hospitals will oblige for you when unfortunately you are least able to fight against it  because you are ill and fall under their control. It’s the “you are going to die anyway” philosophy that got so many seniors murdered during the COVID crisis. And getting rid of expensive sick seniors who paid into Medicare their whole lives at 75+ in favor of the new younger migrant know nothing voters who work cheaper and will be grateful for all the social programs democrats offer is an idea too tempting to resist. Killing a number of birds with one stone such as it is, is priceless.",2024-09-13
you'll know the stock price has bottomed out when it hits zero.  Worst run of the pharmas on earth.  Prob too late for them to even sell themselves at a decent price.  This is worse than dead money and all because of bad science and shytty mgmt,2024-09-13
