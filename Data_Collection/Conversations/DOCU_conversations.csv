"Agree docu needs to “prune” much more head count given single digit growth. Compare docu revenue per employee to competitors. Conversely, issue would be solved by producing double digit growth with limits on hiring.  What percent is docu SBC cost?   Is Docu SBC given by C Suite to one another very excessive compared to competitors? Is any review of Docu balanced that doesn’t spend a few sentences on this SBC topic?  The SBC cost doesn’t show up looking at PE valuation? Between the potential after/if  docu labor and SBC cleaned up - No wonder private equity was interested in company? If an accountable board cleaned the fat and excess SBC up while executing AI in agreement management, could the future for docu be bright? The company esignature product is currently best in class.",2024-10-03
"These numbers make no sense: e-signature market projected to reach $35B in 2030, with unbelievable 34% CAGR, while $DOCU is expecting anemic growth of 5-7% this year and the next one.That means that:- either all those CAGR estimates are completely astray\- or $DOCU's management is inept- or competition is very astute (I know about $ADBE, but I hear there are other new entrants).Irrational valuation?! With PEG > 2, or EV/Sales/Growth > 0.5x, they are, in fact, a bit over the industry average. The only ""rationale"" would be if growth could regain fuel to at least low double digits",2024-09-14
"@Chris Lau APP, PEGA, and GPN, in that order, seem really interesting.  TY!",2024-09-13
@RealRural QQQJ maybe?  Index fund though and newer so performance isn't that impressive yet.,2024-09-10
"@Pingili I'm not saying but today. in fact, I'm adding to bonds at this moment. but I have 4 off this list and will add as I deem appropriate. ddog I got for $80 and will add more shares at some point.",2024-09-10
"Good ideas and theory on this press release, but way too much research for this ancient investor. Anyone have recommendations if there is/are mid-cap tech ETFs or CEFs to look at? I'd be happy to get decent performance with diversified tech risk from a mid cap fund.",2024-09-10
"I actually see quite a few solid companies here with share prices that should appreciate considerably, if not immediately. Some names I don't recognize and a few I find questionable but overall not a bad list to generate some ideas for further research.Mid-caps are something my portfolio needs desparately and I would like to open ~5 positions in a few new stocks over the coming weeks (usually 1/4th to 1/3rd the size of what I consider a full position). I'd like at least 3 to be mid-caps. I'm really eyeing TER, but my portfolio is already considerably overweight in the semiconductor industry.",2024-09-10
"@shashkum agree SBC and labor efficiency needs to be cleaned up.  The softball questions on earnings call with half the analysts sending temps to ask questions = few hold management accountable to shareholders other than “Mr market” with stock stuck at $50-60.  When it comes to financial, do most folks act in self interest?  When board members are not buying or bought sizable amount of shares = why end the excess printing of sbc shares that  they too are enjoying?  Given upside potential of ducu products,  is or will Docu one day be attractive to an activist investor buying position large enough to force board seat and clean up? Hopefully, for normal shareholders not invited to the sbc feast, maybe Docu board will do right thing and fix the excess sbc and labor efficiency issue? Conversely, Are boxes being checked for the board seats vs building shareholder value for all shareholders?  Aside from these big issues, Docu has wonderful software with much upside potential within AI agreement management.  Thus, will be interesting to watch and see which direction this company goes?",2024-09-10

@brainleft are you being sarcastic?! A good number of these are rated hold by the Alpha quant system.,2024-09-09

@shashkum I think in the long run yes I agree GAAP is always better. I'm ok with non-GAAP here because I think we typically see this practice slow down as shares appreciate,2024-09-09
We should start talking about GAAP financials and not non-GAAP financials. By issuing hell lot of SBC ; the shareholders are being taken for a ride.,2024-09-09
