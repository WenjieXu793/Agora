"One-third of $CSCO's revenues now come from software sales and, of its total revenue, 50% is annual recurring. So CSCO of today is not the same as that of Y2K. The change has been slow but it's there to see in the revenue streams.CSCO has partnered nVidia and is likely to make a substantial investment in nVidia backed CoreWeave. The article here explains the details better than I can.  www.techzine.eu/...I bought some CSCO stock 5 years ago and I remain a disappointed investor in it. While the market has zoomed up based on upward moving valuation multiples, CSCO's valuation remains in the unloved sub 15X territory based on earning. CSCO has to find a way to make the market fall in love with it again. It has not done so yet.",2024-10-05
"@deadhead213 .....I cant disagree with your on that.  I have held it about 3 years and it has been a frustrating hold.  I almost sold it a couple of times.  Usually when I sell something I end up regretting it later.  So I hang on and collect a safe and reliable dividend and continue to wait, and wait, and wait. Cisco has raised their dividend payment every year since I purchased it, and dividends are not dead money.   They do add up over time.  At least Cisco has begun to move in the right direction lately.  We will see how long that last, or if it will continue to be a frustrating hold.",2024-10-04
@Kirk Spano In order to get back to better there may be some resistance but that bit of resistance is far better for the future than the destruction we are seeing now.,2024-10-02

@boris gudonov Every one of these investment firms have a list. Maybe they're pitching their book. They want you to buy the price up! ;-),2024-10-02
"""While it added to its offerings, the business barely changed since the early 2000s.""This was enough to tell me the authors may be experienced in the stock market, their information of this sector and Cisco specifically is seriously lacking. Take any guidance from this article with a massive grain of salt. They completely fail to mention the fact that Cisco is now a software company rather than a solely hardware based route switch company.That they have shifted more than half of their revenue into recurring subscriptions... They've had their ups and downs, but to call them the same company from the 2000's is by definition ignorant.",2024-10-02
"@golfcat1 we ought to control the border, but, we ought to be issuing enough work visas and green cards to offset Boomer retirements. That requires millions of immigrants per year.",2024-10-01
I’m comfortable with a long term hold & 3% dividend with CSCO. It also looks like it’s moving higher from August lows.,2024-10-01
@santlo It won't. Markets will tank if the weird guys take over. They are a threat to democracy and capitalism.,2024-09-30
"@erbrown Don’t bet the farm on that. I don’t see cap gain tax on unrealized gains. For openers, evaluations are impossible, not only for the likes of farm land but also for 1000 shares of a publicly-traded stock, liquidity is a big deal. Then there’s the velue of the local family business. Not so fast.",2024-09-29
Stock Market at record levels under Biden-Harris …why will change  to Trump be better for market?,2024-09-29
Could buy $zoom which was founded by ex Cisco people. I know for a fact Starlink has no idea how to run an actualized telephony network which has been great news for Cisco and $t AT&T all Year 2024 possibly $rklb RocketLab as well but that has yet to be seen. Certainly Verizon hasn't announced much of anything about anything ever actually not since FIOS anyways. DirecTV making noise suddenly as well too as a consequence. Intel still looks crazy on sale too given soaring gold prices on obvious news as to why that is. Short gold strong sell. Even $fdx FedEx might be good here suddenly as natural gas prices soar hardly an accident that one either with Nancy Pelosi pushing for the Justice Department to attack Visa purely for personal financial gain. Long $wolf Wolfspeed strong buy,2024-09-28
@Marrk And you're an expert at running a trillion dollar company?,2024-09-23
@Steven Fiorillo   Just lucky but I looked at the forward p/e on my Charles Schwab account and saw the difference and bought it at $47.  I like your comments on the history of Cisco.  They are a whale that forgot how to swim.  Cash flow but no bueno on innovation but the AI stuff gives it legs.Thanks.,2024-09-23
"Good article. Thank you. Despite the argument to be made for deployment of cash toward buybacks, I wish large tech companies (I'm looking at you, AAPL) would pay a higher dividend. They don't need the excessive cash reserves that they are maintaining.Long CSCO",2024-09-21
@alschroed Breaking my heart. AT&T is on the move these days,2024-09-20
"Three years and still holding.  Haven't lost all faith in it yet.  Almost sold it a couple of times..........Then I realized that when I do sell something it usually comes back and haunts me.  So I just keep on collecting the dividends and wait, and wait, and............",2024-09-20
Thank You for the article. I sold my CSCO and bought NVDA.,2024-09-20
"Yes, they should have participated in AI but they didn't and I sold at 49. CSCO has had bad management for years reminds me of AT&T.",2024-09-20
"@Always Bullish Me Too AB.  While its boring as CSCO muddles around I sleep safely and because I've owned it for 25 years I'm up 15 times on my original investment and, at current rates, get 50% on my original per share cost annually from my dividend.",2024-09-20
