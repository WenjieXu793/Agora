"PH is one of those that ""got away"" from me. Not once, but twice. I had bought it at 370 and sold at 420, pleased with myself that I had a $50/share gain. Well, it continued its upward surge to around 550.  Fool me once.I put in a buy limit order at 500, expecting it to retrace. It did come back to 508 recently, but I did not pull the trigger. It proceeded to go up to 635. Fool me twice.No one said investing would be easy, but holding PH indefinitely would make it seem that way.",2024-09-28
"My all time favorite! I once had 850+ shares of $PH, back June 2020 @approx $182 / share, then did a panic-sell at the thought of it making up such a large percentage of my portfolio back then (60% !!)  - regrettably sold half of it, but then clawed my way back to purchasing more (it's now my 3rd largest holding)",2024-09-26
"@Dividend Latitude And I forgot to mention my technical analysis - the stock has gapped up 3 times in the last 12 months, without filling those gaps.That is a bullish sign for sure.",2024-09-26
"Excellent article on this well-managed dividend king. Thank you!PH outperforms the SPY, it raises the dividend by double-digits almost evey single year, and... drum roll please... it is an American manufacturing company that actually makes stuff! The US manufacturing base is not dead yet.Anyway, PH has been in absolute Beast Mode lately (no, I'm not a Seattle Seahawks fan, if you were wondering). It is one of my favorite stocks, and has grown into my 2nd-largest individual stock position.",2024-09-26
PH at 22x forward p/e is one of cheaper large cap multi-industrials despite category-leading eps growth and repeated beat/raise quarters.  No reason I can see it shouldn't trade in-line with IR at 27x p/e.  Both great companies.,2024-09-26
