"Good stuff! I work with GPN in my day job so I know how sticky their business is (the same is true any large payment processor, I'm sure). If it gets down to around $90 I think I'll take a position.",2024-10-02
"@Stock Scanner Yes, look at the charts on this one.  Secular change, inability to create a moat, too much leverage, and masking performance via non-GAAP reporting fools no one anymore.",2024-09-25
Stock is down 20% from it's high yesterday on INVESTOR'S DAY!!  Think about that.  The biggest rah rah day of the year led to a 20% stock loss.  And all they talked about was being shareholder friendly lol.  Comical.  They better buy back shares in bulk like they say they will especially at these prices.  Also said to expect something in Q4 regarding selling part of their business.  The sell off seems a bit much but if the general market corrects this one could go down bigly.,2024-09-25
Retail and credit are holding hands as employment numbers stumble.if we could get reliable numbers from the government what would it really look like?,2024-09-25
Whatâ€™s bad about this guidance? 10%+ EPS growth and an 8.5x earnings multiple?,2024-09-25
More obfuscation. The company needs to focus on one thing and one thing only: GAAP profits. Taking constant restructuring charges and proforma'ing them out fools no one.,2024-09-25
"@Florida_Dreaming I don't disagree, I also continue to hold my GPN position rather than increase for now. I consider it a full position for now. Funny enough, PYPL is also another I was buying around the bottom. I'm in agreement with you.",2024-09-24
"@BeenHoldin I truly believe this will get a 15-20 multiple again during the next up cycle, meaning once this slowdown/possible recession passes and the FED has dropped rates 300 bps and restarts QE.  Problem is a loaf of bread may cost ten buck by then but I see GPN as a $250+ stock in two to three years.  I'm not going anywhere but I'm not buying more either.  I own a lot of shares, for me anyway.  But when they say 2025 is a ""transition year"" the stock immediately tanked.  PYPL did this when the new CEO came aboard.  Stock did nothing.  Now that their transition year is coming to an end their stock has moved quite a bit.  I'm pretty long that one too so I'm finally happy while most people had given up on it.",2024-09-24
@Florida_Dreaming When it comes to GPN - the stock falls on both good and bad news equally. lol,2024-09-24
I listened to this entire call and there wasn't a whole lot to get excited about.  The market did react favorably to the part where they said they were returning $7B to shareholders the next three years but right when they gave guidance the stock absolutely tanked immediately.  Literally as the words fell from the guys mouth.  Like why even give guidance during an investors day when you know it'll tank the stock.  This is rah rah day.  Save the poor guidance for earnings calls.  Unreal.  Regardless they made it pretty clear they were sandbagging and would easily beat this guidance.  Very unsatisfied today.  Oh well.,2024-09-24
Talk about sending the wrong message. Stock dropped from a high of $117 today to $103 currently.,2024-09-24
"@Chris Lau APP, PEGA, and GPN, in that order, seem really interesting.  TY!",2024-09-13
@RealRural QQQJ maybe?  Index fund though and newer so performance isn't that impressive yet.,2024-09-10
"@Pingili I'm not saying but today. in fact, I'm adding to bonds at this moment. but I have 4 off this list and will add as I deem appropriate. ddog I got for $80 and will add more shares at some point.",2024-09-10
"Good ideas and theory on this press release, but way too much research for this ancient investor. Anyone have recommendations if there is/are mid-cap tech ETFs or CEFs to look at? I'd be happy to get decent performance with diversified tech risk from a mid cap fund.",2024-09-10
"I actually see quite a few solid companies here with share prices that should appreciate considerably, if not immediately. Some names I don't recognize and a few I find questionable but overall not a bad list to generate some ideas for further research.Mid-caps are something my portfolio needs desparately and I would like to open ~5 positions in a few new stocks over the coming weeks (usually 1/4th to 1/3rd the size of what I consider a full position). I'd like at least 3 to be mid-caps. I'm really eyeing TER, but my portfolio is already considerably overweight in the semiconductor industry.",2024-09-10
