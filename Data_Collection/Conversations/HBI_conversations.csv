"Innerwear has also been ailing.There is too much debt here.Basically they spent large aums to reacquire global Champion, but then sold it at a loss.  In paet because it was damaged by previous management.  Similarly, the massive addition of debt and the run to join the mask business in covid was a horrible set of decisions.Truly horrible.  So they lost champion to pay off covid and still have weak leftovers with big debt overhangs.Not a good situation.",2024-09-20
>>> management is forecasting declining revenues but expanding margins. This is highly unusual...Doesn't that actually seem like a reasonable expectation if Hanes is removing a money-losing source of revenue (Champion) and paying down debt (reducing interest expenses)?,2024-09-20
