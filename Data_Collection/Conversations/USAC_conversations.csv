@Phil in OKC EXACTLYWhile price appreciation might be nice (in moderation) I enjoy the SP declines even more ; I’ve always liked a good sale.,2024-10-02
"@Smarty_Pants From a separate article, it seems that USAC's problems are more related to a high amount of debt.  As an LP, most of the profits are returned to shareholders so it doesn't give them the wiggle room to reduce debt.  Profits are restrained because lots of the earnings are spent on interest.""This sounds like a fiscally responsible move from a company that offers a juicy 8.5% yield. However, everything has its opportunity cost. USAC spends roughly 80% of its EBITDA on financing costs and unitholder distributions. With minimal discretionary FCF remaining, it will take several years to improve the financials of the company. Management has been very clear that increasing the distribution is not in the cards until this situation is resolved.""",2024-09-28
"The last paragraph makes no sense.  USAC growth from ""idle equipment"" will be far more profitable than growth from ""new unit orders"".  The cost to generate revenues will be far lower when you already own the equipment.And, FWIW, USAC is also adding new units as well.  A tight market benefits all three major suppliers with higher pricing and longer contracts.",2024-09-27
"@Phil in OKC I think the important thing for these companies is to just get in line. It's pretty clear the demand will be there so getting in line for scarce equipment that is in demand seems like a wise move. Otherwise, you stand to lose market share as competitors get all the available equipment.USAC has tough decisions to make, on one hand improving the balance sheet needs done, but all of this is occurring when natural gas consumption may start accelerating with LNG exports and AI.",2024-09-26
"@Ronald Ferrie Can you add some color on the importance of USOC timing their capex in the ordering of new engines, since I believe Cat (for example) often needs a year or two of advance notice, to actually begin a build out of a large an order to purchase their engines. Perhaps supply chains are still affected by the 2020 covid anomaly or other factors. Seems Cat's ability to time their production runs to the demand for new/upgraded compression is just as precarious as that of USOC.  Make sense?",2024-09-26
@elliot_mllr You mean your wife looks over your shoulder at your portfolio?  Mine could not care less.  She keeps her money under the mattress.,2024-09-26
@elliot_mllr Don't feel like the Lone Ranger.  I too made a similar rookie mistake 20 years ago selling big oil upstream tickers because they were trending downward in price.,2024-09-26
"What most readers are not aware of is the precursors to USAC success and that is , what is happening in the Permian Basin gas production and the new pipeline builds to move more gas to the Gulf coast for sale to Europe and China. Right now the RRC is still allowing producers to flare large volume of gas, which tells us that the gas inventory is building to build another 500 million mcf gas to allow a new pipeline too be built or one of the existing pipelines to expand their current line. As you monitor USAC EBITDA to debt and continue to see it drop, while noting the debt is dropping and we should see the Equity account to become positive, then what is next is for ET to find another Gas system that ET can buy and transfer to USAC. Dividend over the next 3-5 years should see a bump but only when debt is more manageable",2024-09-26
"I buy K1 tickers to hold forever.  I have owned a couple of compression names over the year but settled on USAC for the yield and because of the strength of its parent company ET.  USAC fits hand in glove with my basket of  pipeline MLPs.  since I am holding forever, I look first at yield.  Price goes up and down in this sector, so I am not looking to ever buy and sell them.  I learned some interesting points about USAC from your analysis and the read was well worth my time.  Giving you a follow.  BTW, the CEO of USAC is wise to wait til after the election to make sure we have a greennlight to “drill baby drill.”",2024-09-19
"@atlasman :   Many years ago I was in, and then sold, upstream crude oil companies at a serious loss. Never again, but some losses remain available.Elliot Miller",2024-09-17
@Ronald Ferrie My metric for USAC is to divide annual change in debt by annual capex.  Over the last couple years the number has dropped to roughly 50%.  I interpret that as USAC partially self-funding their Capex (while paying interest and distributions in full out of revenues).  If USAC maintains record setting performance that percentage should eventually reach zero.  Every new compressor they field drives the need to borrow for next year's capex lower because the margin is so high compared to the cost of borrowing.,2024-09-17
"@chizle DCF is a non gaap term so it can vary between companies. If you look at the 10-Q you will see negative cash flow after distributions, interest payments and CAPEX spend.Ultimately the add needs to add up, thus increasing the debt levels to account for the negative cash flows.",2024-09-17
"As a very long term USAC holder, I view it as a bond substitute with a high yield and a likely growth kicker, very well managed, with a hands-off but well financed parent in the background.  Having prospered with USAC in the past, I am confidentl they will manage the future well.",2024-09-16
"I have owned USAC for several years with an average price of $18.55 and a yield of slightly over 11%. My position is a modest one compared to my holdings of EPD, ET, MPLX, WES, and AM. USAC provides me with a nice return of tax deferred income and it is a perfect Hold. Its sale would generate not only capital gains which I could offset by loss carryovers, but also depreciation recapture and the taxable ordinary income that would generate, so taxes also make USAC a perfect Hold..Elliot Miller",2024-09-16
"Your statement ""When supply out runs demand, investors should expect to see margin expansion."" may be backwards.",2024-09-16
"@Ronald Ferrie I agree with the ""hold"" conclusion.  Similar to SmartyPants I bought a bunch in the covid crash so I have a yield on cost of 21%.  There was a recent article on SA about pipeline companies getting preliminary agreements for building new pipelines.  If that happens the various compression companies will  have an opportunity for meaningful growth.  Then there is inflation to consider.  USAC can keep the $2.10 dividend while inflation raises the nominal fees for its services, as well as it's costs of doing business.  The yield as a % will drop, the value of the distribution will drop while the dollar amount remains at $2.10.",2024-09-16
"@Smarty_Pants I absolutely agree with you, and total returns can be manipulated easily by changing the start date of the comparison of two companies.More to your point…while I have also pointed out the difference in price between USAC and the S&P, I also show it essentially tracked the S&P on a total returns basis thanks to the 10% yield. The tax benefits would allow it to possibly beat the S&P.I think most investors at SA want to beat the market average so that’s the primary thought in the HOLD rating.However, your purchase history shows that is still possible in USAC if you make lemonade when the market gives you lemons.Great discussion. As usual, there is more than one way to financial success.",2024-09-16
"@Ronald Ferrie Thanks for replying based on the facts at hand rather than simply for argument's sake.  You raise some good points as well.I have noticed the majority of Total Return advocates focus almost exclusively on increasing prices, most often driven by growing profits, while dismissing dividends as a source of Total Return.The truth is there's more than one way to skin the TR cat.  The CAGR of the S&P 500 since the start of the last major bull market (~1980) is a shade under 12% with dividends reinvested.Any income investment that can generate payouts of 12+%, while holding a constant price, will match or beat the index.  This fact often escapes the notice of TR adherents who insist on evaluating in terms of price growth alone.  In fact many refuse to consider the impact of dividends on TR, yet it is equally as important as price growth.Evaluating an income producing stock like USAC requires a different framework of comparison than what is usually used for growth stocks.  My first purchase of USAC in Summer 2015 cost me $19+.  I have added units at lower prices and then doubled up at $4.46 in March of 2020.  My average cost is now around $6.16 for an overall yield of roughly 34% on my cost.If USAC dropped to $7 from its current price of ~$22.50 and stayed there the S&P 500 would never match my Total Return (starting in 2020) going forward.  I haven't estimated how they would compare since my initial 2015 purchase, but over time I would expect my TR to catch and surpass the index as 34+% income outpaces 12% price growth by a large margin, year after year.For income producing stocks, the price you pay is a major factor in TR over the long run.  Those who ignore that fact are missing out on potentially outstanding investment opportunities.Again, thank you for the reasoned reply and discussion.",2024-09-16
In my mind the only questions are whether it can sustain its distribution and manage its increasing debt.  I believe the answer to both questions is yes but not without caution.  It is a hold for me but one I watch carefully every quarter.  It does help my YoC  is 16% and selling would trigger a capgain that I do not want to pay.,2024-09-16
"@Smarty_Pants you bring up good counter points so thanks for adding them here.I’ll toss in a few more bits of info.1. The contracted compression market is only about 30% of the total industry. The midstream and E&P companies are still buying this same equipment and arguably have bigger pockets to make this happen.2. While I agree USAC is not a growth stock, that doesn’t mean investors should turn a blind eye to total returns…money is money and getting TOO fixated on yield can be an opportunity cost. I like dividends as well but I try to keep a balance in my investments.An example would be midstream companies like EPD or WES that have comparable (slightly lower than USAC) but have also shown moderate price growth over the last several years, leading to higher total returns than USAC. I own both EPD and WES.Thanks for the good comment.",2024-09-16
