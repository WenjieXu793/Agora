"@Theme Catcher Invest pecking order for all gold miners over the long term is irrelevant because they all suck.  look at your 10- and 20-year charts vs the metal.eventually, as progressives take over, there is a reasonable chance all mining assets will be turned over to miners whose health have been “affected.”based on past performance (look at the charts) it makes sense to own the metal or the gld. avoiding miners has always been my strategy.  they are “trading sardines” that have been uninvestible forever.aside from the actual metals and pure etfs i also own a trader, glencore.",2024-08-29

"@Theme Catcher Invest so, in other words, a “trading sardine.”i’ve been adding to gld & the physical since the early ‘90s.  have never sold.  is there a gold-producing company that you like more than the metal as a long-term investment?",2024-08-28
