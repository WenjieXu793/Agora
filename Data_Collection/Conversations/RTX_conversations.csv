"@Rogerio Adelino, CFA Congratulations on your 10th SA article. RXT has been a great investment for me. I've been holding it for 4+ years and have an unrealized gain of 92% on it. Your analysis certainly helped reinforce my plan to continue to hold it..",2024-10-06
It will be interesting to see HUM stock after earning report.,2024-10-06
@MySami it will be greatly reduced if Pooh decides to invade Taiwan. I think Putins disaster in Ukraine is giving him second thoughts.,2024-10-05
@123semi It's not in Putin's interest for him to unilaterally pull out of the Ukraine at this time..The West will have to offer Putin a plausible off ramp dealthat will allow Putin a reason to quit fighting.Putin has control of approx 20% of the Ukraine land mass.Most of it he has controlled since 2014.  Perhaps the best time to have seriously negotiated with Putin would have been 8 years ago...? As it stands now its absolutely fantasy to think Putin willexit the whole of Ukraine without Zelensky giving up someterritory to get a deal done.,2024-10-05

@spitblu That’s exactly what I did. Started loading up when it was trading at $79 and stopped when it got to $102. Been holding my position ever since ,2024-10-03
The time to start loading on was after the engine stuff began.  The c-suite handled and has been handling it textbook well.  Its shares give an investor a nice hybrid of commercial and defense exposure.  A great stock to have in the portfolio.,2024-10-03

@HardytheTrader I had to roll out calls on LMT a little further as I was in danger of shares I have owned for a decade and a half being called away.,2024-10-02
"''Yes, the way mankind is going, best to be overweight Cyber tech, and F-35s/Missiles.''Yep, there are some very bad people in positions of concentrated power who are funding endless wars and arming others nations / groups to fight. They are skilled in packaging and cloaking their fiendish intentions for war in beguiling language for mass consumption. Utterly slippery slope.",2024-10-02
"""Have held LMT, GD, NOC, RTX for years, nearly a decade."" @SuperPac You forgot to thank American tax payers this time. Yes, the way mankind is going, best to be overweight Cyber tech, and F-35s/Missiles.",2024-10-01
"@HardytheTrader Have held LMT, GD, NOC, RTX for years, nearly a decade. These are great long term stocks, assets for all seasons. Intrinsically, a carve out from the federal pie goes to them and then to the shareholders as dividends / buy-backs and stock price growth. Never selling.",2024-10-01
