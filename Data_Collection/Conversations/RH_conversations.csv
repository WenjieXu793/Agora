The reason I purchased RH today is I believe the long drought is the luxury home furnishing business is at an inflection point.,2024-09-25
I bought the dip today as I believe in the CEO and his vision.,2024-09-25
"@Clark158f1 I see RH coming back as a stock in a lower interest rate environment.@Clark158f1 I just purchased RH today as I believe that as mortgage rates decline and money is easier for homeowners to furnish their homes, the stock will rise or  conversely it shouldn’t have declined to $332 area.",2024-09-25
RH has run to far at this point.....60x earnings are not sustainable.Takt profits and wait for the dip to $ 320 or below to rebuy imo.,2024-09-23
"@umiami  this thing is going to drop like an elevator with a busted cable...  The half point cut should prove to the market why precisely this sort of stock is now WAY overbought.  People are not about to rush out and start COVID spending just because rates are better.  Re-fi? Sure.  I'm a builder in a fantastic Florida Beach market.  Fastest growing county in Florida.  Sales are slowing, subs are calling me for work, architects are cutting their rates, custom builds are now bidding the crap out of jobs... and Restoration Hardware to the moon!! . I haven't touched my vendor account with RH in a long time and don't suspect we will need to.Honestly, I appreciate all analysts here.  I appreciate their time, insight, and giving us more resources to digest.  I mean no disrespect...butTl take from someone on the front line (for 30 years in this industry) folks - this is a STRONG SELL at these levels.  If you need a good 20% loss for some reason in the next 45 days.  Here's your candidate.",2024-09-19
"""The market seems to agree, as the company's stock is trading up +51.35 (+20.02%) after posting solid results""  With a low float and quite a high short interest, I would argue that by far the majority of Friday's advance was short covering.  Accordingly, I'm expecting the wide gap to be filled, if not starting next week, the week after.",2024-09-15
"@jeffk100 Thanks for reading and the comment. Yes, I always have concerns as well. My thesis is long-term, so it's not always a straight walk up the stairs to sustainable growth. But their current strategy, product expansion, and strength of branding certainly look promising to me, and I’d expect to be rewarded over time.",2024-09-14

"""My take is that RH (NYSE: NYSE:RH), a high-end retailer of home furnishings, has demonstrated its capability for long-term, sustainable growth going forward, even if concerns about adverse conditions in the housing market linger.""This is a provably ridiculous statement.  Over the last 3 yrs, including this quarter, this company has not grown earnings AT ALL.  In fact earnings hv reduced.  there is no demonstration of growth over this time frame, none.  In fact the only real growth this thing has shown was during the covid years when the gov was printing trillions and handing it to every fool on earth to go spend on needless crap like RH furniture.  Once the money dried up, so did this company's ""growth""",2024-09-13
"There are all sorts of names like Nike, Sam Adams, Intel, Wolfspeed and this have been absolutely smashed to pieces in the 2022 crash which is still playing out in upon US real estate actually and maybe some White Knights out there to pick up the pieces in these names as happened to Lumber Liquidators actually. *CRAZY* competitive market tho and social media and woodworking a huge thing so recommend starting with April Wilkerson on YouTube to start to see how creative this phenomenon in fact is...look for these types of ""hook ups"" in names such as this first to show they're serious about getting into this market. Long $etd Ethan Allen Furniture strong buy $wsm Williams Sonoma had a huge run here but still has barely expanded at all and where it has done very well.",2024-09-13
ARHS is an interesting company in this space that is far less followed / known than WSH and RH. Better operating metrics and potential growth housing hopefully reaccelerates.,2024-09-13
"@Alex Pitti I’ve been out so didn’t get to really dig through numbers. Lovesac up 20% today on similar ok but not great, putting in back in middle of range. I’ve seen a few consumer facing stocks do this. I think next years numbers for furniture, boats, RVs, etc all too high. It’s like market already pricing in recovery from a few interest rate cuts but I don’t think spending on this stuff will rebound that well. I’m about flat on that section of my short book last few months.",2024-09-12
@beach_trader rh lowered guidance and the stock exploded because they had an ok august. strange,2024-09-12
"@Charles St they are not even spending that much. Numbers pretty mediocre but stock has gotten beaten down last few weeks. Personally, I think they are over promising on back end of year, but we’ll see. Stock won’t hold 300",2024-09-12
"RH rallies as ""resilient"" consumers spend, spend, spend? While HD and LOW are getting a smack down, allaying it to a tapped-out consumer, with fairly dismal projections going forward? Tell us another joke.",2024-09-12
"@jeffk100 Short-squeeze given ~11% float, founder is still CEO, pivoting from being just a furniture store the last 3 years.",2024-09-12
"Speculating on CCL again.  Bought last week and am hoping for a pop after the Fed meeting, and then will probably sell.",2024-09-12
