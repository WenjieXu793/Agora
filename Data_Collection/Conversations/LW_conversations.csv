@Bill the Bag Man agree.  At a macro level the weekly summary that would be somewhat useful would be the number of companies that reported positive earnings growth or revenue growth net inflation.  Of which I think only CCL did.  Would need to check.  But otherwise not a very helpful metric.,2024-10-05
Do companies ever really guide earnings very high? No. They guide on the conservative cautious side. Usually that is why an equity tanks if they miss or guide lower. Nothing earth shattering and it is not saying much about the macro economic picture.,2024-10-05
"@Building Benjamins Yeah...I'm not sure it is worth an expanding multiple. I really think it's an interesting company but the risk reward looks a little skewed at the moment. One person brought up the risk of Ozempic and how that is beginning to alter eating habits and how it will impact suppliers of heavy, starchy foods. I'm not convinced at the moment it will make an impact, but it is worth noting. For me, it needs to go lower to come off the watch list and earn a spot in the portfolio.",2024-10-02

@rrb1981 revs and eps should accelerate from here and cause PE to expand. Investors have been willing to pay a 20 multiple for this name when posting positive growth. Dockworker strike is a modest near term positive as it will shutdown imports,2024-10-02
@The Real Cavalier They said IBM was a dinosaur business but now people want their shares.,2024-10-02
LW projecting 2025 EPS to be $4.15 to $4.30. I think fair value is likely sub $60/share. I would be interested in the mid $50's. They appear to be making adjustments to counter softness in the market.,2024-10-02
@MichaelW_R It's called creative destruction.  CVS is a dinosaur business.  It will soon go to zero and all employees will be laid off.  They'll find jobs in the industries that are replacing these old businesses like CVS.  This is the nature of capitalism.  Embrace change.  We're living in the best of times.,2024-10-01
@MichaelW_R business are struggling yet the stock market is at record highs with strong gdp growth?,2024-10-01
Qe and massive amount of liquidity and debt fixes this..,2024-10-01
Everyone demands higher wages. Fine. We'll just be cutting 10% of the workforce once the free money stops being spent. Hope you're happy.,2024-10-01
@Charles St I wonder if Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve have a pulse on this disturbing trend: CVS announced layoffs. I sense from the headlines a lot of restructuring; increased layoffs; higher material and labor costs; businesses across the board are struggling for the most part. I wonder if this was part of the panic that the Fed saw to help drive that 1/2 point cut.,2024-10-01

"Notice how many businesses are shutting down plants and stores, laying people off, and making harsh cuts to their business model, to try and stay afloat? There's a reason for that. The economy is collapsing. When even the dollar stores get wrecked, you know things are headed down quickly.",2024-10-01
"@cinnamongirl That would reflect confidence.  Truth in advertising: Half my position will be gone if the stock stays above 65 this Friday.  I must admit, I do like the idea of buying at current prices (close to 66) and selling the 65 call for Oct 18 at 4.90.  Pays you for time and if the earnings go south you get some downside protection.  Not a recommendation as they say.  Good luck.",2024-09-17
"@cinnamongirl So the question becomes, are you confident enough to play the coming earnings on 10/1?  I can't decide if it will be another doomsday with the stock going to the high 40s or a bounce to low 70s.",2024-09-14
@MentallyGone Nothing is impossible...I am on the sideline till at least the next Q. Other great company to buy first.,2024-09-12
"@Gentleman Argentum I cannot argue with your decision.  Management leaves a great deal to be desired.  I am still in it, but the upcoming earnings call will have me on edge.  The question is:  Can management successfully knock the stock price down another 50%?",2024-09-12
"@MentallyGone I sold it at 62, I do not have confidence in LW management.",2024-09-11
"@Jason FieberThanks for this useful analysis.  I am an income investor or I would own many hundreds of shares of this company if not for the minor dividend.  To my mind LW is the best in class in their space.  While 15% of sales tied up with MCD seems high, to my mind these two need each other equally and that tempers the argument.  Some thing you didn't discover about these guys is that a few years ago they developed a food-based additive to increase the life of french fries.  Normal fries go limp in 15 minutes making delivery a problem.  LW came up with this additive which increases the crisp life of their fries to 30 minutes.  Their latest version of this benefit actually can make fries stay hot and crispy for over 45 minutes, at a somewhat higher cost.  The company has kept this a secret because it offers its customers that buy the treated product a built-in competitive advantage.  I am an avid customer and one thing I can tell is the firm treats their retail offerings as well.  One benefit is that those store bought fries stay crispy all the way through a meal at home.  Also, your fries don't stick together when frozen.  I came across this info when working as a reviewer for a publisher of business case studies.  One case I reviewed was based on an episode of NPR's series entitled ""Planet Money"" which talked about the company.  I have preferred MCD's fries for years.  Since I bought my first bag from LW I am a total convert.",2024-09-10
