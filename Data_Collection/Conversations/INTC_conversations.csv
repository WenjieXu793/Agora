"I bought shares just for fun at $22.38. Yes, I would buy more if we see $18, $19, or $20 again. What made me do it. Two things, I’m getting it at 1997 prices (l’m a time traveler) and the $5B investment by Apollo. I also think there might be more interested parties coming in to invest.",2024-10-06
"@Nick Investor all the risks that you have mentioned are in place, but at the same time Intel has apparent tailwinds as well",2024-10-06
"There are several things that worry me about Intel, and I’m not sure that everything is within their control to fix. However, there are also some positives. The bad..First, Intel must continue to keep spending on R&D to keep up with their competitors. Intel’s R&D expense was over $16B in 2023. An astronomical sum for a company that’s losing money. In the latest quarter they had spent more on R&D YoY compared to the same quarter in the previous year.Second, as mentioned, Intel has an operating loss, as well as a net loss. They’re in a tight position and they need to regain profitability. How can they do that with increasing costs and decreasing revenues? Their R&D expense is very taxing on their performance, and restructuring charges were in the hundreds of millions, which are funds that are being squandered instead of reinvested in the company’s products. Let’s hope they know what they’re doing with the restructuring.Speaking of revenues, in the latest quarter their Data Center and AI revenues fell compared to the previous year. It seems to be decreasing consistently (at least since 2022). Their client computing revenues are still powering ahead. Intel’s cash flow from operations is barely staying positive because they have huge depreciation and share-based compensation added back in as non-cash charges. But we cannot ignore those as depreciation essentially signals what needs to ultimately end up being replaced one day. Intel’s position in such a tough competitive market means they must continue investing in equipment (which they do). Share based compensation is also not ideal from the perspective of investors. It is growing and the company is unprofitable. We are losing our slice of the pie, which is compounded by the losses they are incurring. Overall, their cash flow from operations is poor quality. Intel has a mountain of debt that continues to increase. They had $48.3B in the latest quarter. The good..To turn things around, Intel’s entire future hinges on the products it is releasing. Meteor Lake is out. Lunar Lake was recently launched. Arrow Lake is coming soon. It appears that Lunar Lake is making good headway with customers. The performance has been acceptable and it seems that finally customers are not disappointed with Intel.Intel also cut their dividend, which is not great for income investors looking for a steady stream of income, but they are signaling that they are redirecting cash to where it needs to go.Liquidity-wise, they have a lot of cash ($11.3B) and short-term investments ($18.0B) on hand. Netting these against the pile of debt presents a more positive image, but they need to make more progress and get back to profitability. Intel also have access to credit facilities of $7 billion and $8 billion, with no borrowings outstanding as of June 29, 2024.",2024-10-06
"Long Intel and other than the disappointment of the temporary dividend cut this is a classic  value play. I’ve said many times “Look for a company with a large but solvable problem run by honest competent management that has driven the stock price price far below its intrinsic value then take a meaningful position. I said that about IBM, GE and 3M and got them all three as homeruns",2024-10-06
A few things have changed for / with INTC... the real money supporting INTC will appear - INTC has so much legacy benefit the USA government is not going to let it fail (completely) - patience is going to be key going forward - but investors will be rewarded,2024-10-06

@born_to_run Intel has a bunch customers that count on custom accelerators.  Intel's xeon-6 chips are good enough to convince them to upgrade.  Intel's AVX 10.2 roadmap appears to be part of that upgrade plan.,2024-10-06
"@Catsaver I agree, although it has been 4 years since their Barefoot co-packaged optics demo. They apparently gave up on that technology.  Raja K commented about optical IO for Falcon Shores... but, I'm guessing he was counting on this old version.The recent OCI technology looks better ... 4Tb chiplets.  Still, I'm guessing we won't see it unless someone partners for it ahead of Intel using it.",2024-10-06
"@Fabian Garcia Panther Lake cores are entering production this quarter ... bspd, gaa,18a.  I expect them to continue to use TSM for the GPU.  PG has said in interviews that the 18a health is the reason they're halting 20a wafers.

"@SuperPac:  Presuming Powell / the Fed continues to be DATA based (AKA rational) about their moves, that's the best we can have. For example, ongoing evidence we aren't entering a recession (if the recent jobs data is a valid indication) should preclude ""too many"" rate cuts. I believe the experts at the Fed are MUCH more competent to make such decisions than a bazillion armchair pundits and political hacks that infest the internet with their emotional policy opinions, but few facts and VERY little actual math and economics.  That's why I never say ""the Fed should do X short term"".  Having lived through the inflation storm of the late 60's through early 80's, preventing anything close to THAT is job one by a country mile for the fed, IMO.",2024-10-06

"To be comfortable with INTC, one must invest  from contrarian perspective i.e. contrary to the current Bells of the Ball NVDA, AMD, etc. Notwithstanding, INTC's battered down positioning at present make for a long term, strong upward growth cadence - Dividend cut and imminent discontinuation; 15% employment cuts foreshadowed; recent invitation back to the AI party with with the critical acclaim received by its Lunar Lake offering; SMCI's recent announcement that it's servers are running on INTC's Xeon 6 processors; announced $5B interest by Apollo - dont believe they believe in throwing good money after bad; announcement of Qualcomm's recent interest (most likely in Foundry and due to TSMC margin pressure); etc. Likewise the macro is also quite favourable at this juncture. Taken together INTC is a Strong Buy here. PS: With Buffett's penchant for buying off the operating table combined with the recent material sell down of BAC, AAPL...hmmm!",2024-10-06
"Another perspective is that Intel doesn't suffer from the same systemic risk that TSMC, AMD, and NVIDIA suffer from.  If the AI boom turns into an AI bust, or if there's a general slowdown in demand for tech goods for economic or geopolitical reasons, TSMC, AMD, and NVIDIA's stratospheric valuations will come back to earth.But if Intel succeeds in 18a, or its AI/GPU strategy succeeds, or its silicon photonics takes a chunk of Broadcom's switching chip business, Intel will take off from its current very low price, regardless of what the overall tech market does.Investing is weighing risk and reward.  Intel has multiple paths to reward and is relatively immune to systemic risk due to current pricing - I think it's worth having some in a portfolio (and I do).I see Intel as a decent speculative investment, and ironically, something of a hedge against systemic risk in the tech sector.",2024-10-06
