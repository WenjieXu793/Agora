"@grok42 I would strongly suggest reading the article in the WSJ this morning on Uber and TSLA. It spells it out clearly and why Waymo partnered with Uber. Its all about scale and to achieve scale you need technology and riders. ""The deal with Waymo was particularly notable, as the company already runs its own robotaxi service in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix. Under that agreement, Uber will be the exclusive platform for booking rides in Waymo’s cars in Atlanta and Austin, Texas, when the service launches in those two markets next year. While Uber once aspired to build its own robotaxis, it has since decided to play to its strengths. “Generally, we want to build a marketplace, and we want to stay as pure-play a marketplace as we can,” Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said at a Goldman Sachs investment conference in San Francisco last month.

"@wboz I'm not saying that the CT is safer for pedestrians but it may be. Getting run into by anything would be painful but drastic angles might be no worse. The smoother underbody of Teslas might also be less damaging to one who is run over. Flat surfaces may be harder on the eyes but no more damaging to the body. Exactly why do you think Cybertrucks would be more dangerous? I they are larger, they might be safer by virtue of carrying more cargo and making fewer trips.",2024-10-04
"@RayJon I mean it’s mostly mutually beneficial, given how capital intensive AV is, accessing Uber’s networking and scaling fast is detrimental.",2024-10-03
Uber is definitely trying to make Tesla feel some pressure in the robotaxi space. Uber seems to be looking to partner with every autonomous vehicle operator around the world.,2024-10-03
"@grok42 listen my friend. Go long under there is no when:Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) has signed a multiyear strategic partnership with U.S.-based autonomous vehicle startup Avride to bring its delivery robots and vehicles to Uber and Uber Eats.The delivery partnership will launch first with sidewalk robots on Uber Eats in Austin in the coming weeks, before expanding to Dallas and Jersey City, New Jersey, later this year.",2024-10-03
To make this short and quote me AV will have NO impact on Uber. If you care to listen to a podcast via acquired on Uber ( which I am sure most won’t) you will understand the future,2024-10-02
@The Cardinal in all seriousness this podcast via acquired channel was mine blowing. Investors clearly do not understand Uber is a technology company 1st. They are a connecting platform no matter who you are . They work with Walmart and other companies using thier technology to connect drivers no matter what.In short this reminds me of when we all thought ( myself included) amazon was just a place to shop. And then AWS came out of nowhere. I will say this .. shorts you are done.  no doubt,2024-10-02
"@CR Spencer ""  A decade later I helped her buy a Model 3 Tesla.""At least used Teslas are so cheap that they offer good value...on the other side why buying new if used ones cost 40 -50 %.A problem that BEV dont had 2019...used cars",2024-10-02
"@CR Spencer the better way is to use regular steel, then paint it :Phere is one thing I still have not figured out though. delorean rolled the edges of their panels so people wouldn't slice themselves. tesla hasn't done that. i don't understand why. surely if delorean could do it, it's not too difficult to figure out the process.",2024-10-02
@grok42 it’s not going to be one or the other it’s will be both. All Uber has to do which they are doing already is grab a piece of the market share in AVs. I just listened to a podcast with the ceo and all I can say is wow! This company is so misunderstood in terms of what they do.,2024-10-02
"@cparmerlee I own one of those ""wheeled dumpsters"". They are quite a curiosity and I've been asked about mine dozens of times now in the 7 weeks that I've had it. Among the many innovations is its 800 volt battery. It's actually divided so that it can be charged as 2 - 400 volt batteries as many DC chargers won't output 800 volts. Tesla does its best to design its products with the very latest technology and since trucks are often used for large loads its release was delayed in anticipation of better Tesla made  batteries. Its batteries are better but maybe not as good as was hoped for.The company has recently built a testbed Cybertruck with so called tabless batteries. There are many separate and combinations of battery innovations that Tesla and other EV companies are simutaneously pursuing. There probably aren't many auto enthusiasts who would buy a car just based on whether its batteries are tabless though. People know Tesla has innovative cars but they want a car that looks impressive on the outside. The CT looks like none other and like so many trucks, like it or not, it makes a statement. Call it vanity if you wish but owning a truck, the CT included is like wearing a suit, its a statement that you're ready for business.",2024-10-02
Many are electing to UBER over owning .  Try it you will be a  buyer of the stock  . We should see  40 %  share price appreciation in early 2025 .,2024-10-01
"For myself, the article would benefit from providing an in-depth assessment of Tesla's robotaxi initiative and what sort of threat it presents to Uber. My tentative sense of things is the robotaxi market is going to come down to an intense competition between Uber + robotaxi companies vs Tesla. Tesla will be a bit late to the table (2-3 years?) but may have huge immedidate scale by ""renting"" their customers' cars. The non-Tesla robotaxi companies may be highly incented to parter with Uber as achieving rapid scale may be crucial to their success given Tesla's strategy (eg they need to grab as much market share as possible while Tesla struggles to get to FSD). Also there is some speculation that people will not rent their Tesla's out to Tesla. Not sure that will be the case given Turo's success in doing a similar thing today.The second risk factor that would be great to get some input on is how the dynamics of robotaxis scaling will play out. A lot of pundits claim the cost per mile for a robotaxi will drop to $.50 to $.25 at scale vs $2.50 or so Uber charges currently. If it does indeed drop to say $.50/mile, then just to stay even Uber will have to do 5X the ride volume (I am just guessing on that; it all depends on the take rate for robotaxi rides for Uber, but ride miles and volume have to go up hugely). Of course the ride volume could really take off at those price levels (note this is going to takes years to play out). Those same pundits usually forecast new car sales will drop by 40% to 60% as robotaxies will be considerablly cheaper than owning a second or third car. If so, this is going to create havoc for car manufacturers. I would think the car manufacturers would quickly turn to the robotaxi market to make for the shortfall.When ever I make these comments I get two reactions. People will not want to rent their cars to Uber. That is possible, but Turo rents out private cars today and shows it could work to some level. The second reaction is that robotaxies will take 10 years to reach any kind of scale. To that I would note the Waymo is now doing 100K rides a week just in a few cities and intends to expand rapidly. I think we are at the knee in the S curve already.",2024-09-30
