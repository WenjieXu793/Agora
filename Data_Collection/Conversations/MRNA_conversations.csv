"@ToughMakingaLiving It appears the markets are telling us:* for mrna, the pandemic was its only purpose for existence.* for bntx, the pandemic was a sideline and they've already moved above and beyond that.The markets evaluation appears to be bearing out because while both companies SAY they are building new pipelines, only BNTX is DOING that.",2024-10-06
@achilleus jeeez based on your post ?  sounds like a good time to buy )),2024-10-05
"@ToughMakingaLiving During bear markets, lots of stocks will plunge.But I'm honestly struggling to think of another non-bankrupt stock, during a strong up-trending market, that has collapsed like this. I mean.... ever.This is an absolutely legendary collapse. Serious talk right now MRNA has got to be in the running for the worst performing stock in history.",2024-10-05
"@achilleus Yes fundamentally on their own guidance its sub 40, and their own guidance has proven elusive to say the least. But bancel kept up the guidance and kept selling, classic shareholders should claw back the sales.",2024-10-05
"@ToughMakingaLiving I posted on this site almost TWO YEARS AGO that this thing was going to $80 and was scoffed at by people who like to lose.Again LAST YEAR I said $80 was technical support for this stock and AGAIN was scoffed at by losers.A FEW MONTHS AGO I stated that if this broke through technical support in the low $80s, there would be no bottom and AGAIN the losers croaked like ancient blind crows.And I’m also on record showing plainly that until and unless something changes, this stock has nothing but air to $30.",2024-10-04
"@jara-mill Didn't you say if it got below 80 which you laughed at when I told you you will roundtrip this, you would be a buyer? Now in the 50's again, if you loved it at 500 400 300 200 150 why not buy at 59? Afraid I'm right and its going to moderna who land? Have a great weekend, taking the old lady out for a moderna short profit dinner, AGAIN",2024-10-04
"@jara-mill Really bancel sold billions of stock and its over 100 less than when he sold, and you held that is what I call aging poorly, declining net worth is not good, even for an IT guy. I said out of money in 2025 when they would dilute you nicely. And a 90% decline yum for the shorts",2024-10-04
"Another glorious day in the markets!  Wow some really nice movesLet's look at this thing now oh my gosh....BNTX + 1.59% oops... * 1.63%mrna - 1.54% dismal fail sludgeMarket steadily deciding to buy BioNtech & dumping this insider-bailing garbageMeanwhile yet another 50 pointer APP is skyrocketing, leaving mrna bag holders staring at the launching pad",2024-10-04
"@ToughMakingaLiving - So far Bancel hasn't been fired, Moderna hasn't filed for bankruptcy and share price is NOT $0.  I'd qualify that as aging POORLY.",2024-10-04
"@jara-mill Newsweek Poll Sept 26 th shows Minnesota now a tossup from +4 harris. walz is no good, she should have gone with the Astronaut, she went walz because she had to. I will turn that card over at $18 or less on Moderna or Nov 5. She had no choice, O said Astro $$ said otherwise",2024-10-04
"@ToughMakingaLiving golly.$500 x .12 = $60That is an 88% collapse. A-Tee Ate Per Cent.Epic FallEpic FailThe fail lamp is just… blasting now, mighty lasers flaring across the night skyFail Fail Fail",2024-10-04
"@TheLMC Is it massive? They are burning 300 million per month. ANd wil be under 9 billion going into '25 or worse. That assumes they deliver on their reduced guidance, which they likely won't. Then what? they burn another 3-5 billion in '25, they will need cash or be bankrupt in '26. The pipeline is poor at best for the Op-ex",2024-10-04
"@jara-mill Wish my bills were 1 billion. Looking back at some of our messages, all of mine have aged very well, your clearly not well as we hit another 52 week low and the stock down almost 90% from the top. They will need money in 2025 as I promised you. That will be dilutive and will hit the stock again, completing your round trip from 18-500---->18",2024-10-04
@TheLMC Purely on the technicals:mrna broke below the prior low of $62.55 (November 2023) and did it in decisive fashion.  It is appalling to recognize that Nov '23 is exactly when the current bull market took off.If you look at the monthly chart there's nothing but air between here and the low $30s.,2024-10-03
"@ToughMakingaLiving - ""this will never ever be 500 again nor 400 nor 300 nor 200""Just replying to this message to save it for posterity!  LOL  Let's see how it ages....probably as poorly as the one where you said $0 in 2025 and bankruptcy.I see Bancel and Noubar STILL working at Moderna.  No one's bailing.  Selling shares?  Hey they got bills to pay you know :)",2024-10-03
"@ToughMakingaLiving - Nah, I'll wait....see short-sellers (assuming you have money to put down to the market maker to be a shorty), want you to sell your shares.I would ""consider"" buying below $50.  And not in my current account (Roth IRA).  This would be in a taxable account.",2024-10-03
@ToughMakingaLiving ive been short like you but what's with the massive cash position?  Does that give you any doubts about how much lower it will go?,2024-10-03
"@ToughMakingaLiving This flop is sizing up for another round of shorting, it is performing perfectly, plunging lower off that DEATH CROSS with that 50dma spearing through the 200 day at a blistering 45 degree angleMeanwhile BNTX with a gorgeous flagpole move higher, and not giving back any of the move. Forming a nice bullish pennant now, so there's a solid opportunity to see some gains from the true market leader in this area if and when it breaks out.",2024-10-03
"@jara-mill walz are closing in, he was horrendous. Minnesota is now in play. J He is not fit to run a hot dog stand, that was clear. New 52 week low for your winner",2024-10-03
"@jara-mill You have lost virtually all of your ghost gains, that is no way to run a portfolio. Always let the markets tell you who is right. You should have been a scale down seller, and been out since 220, there is no pipeline, so your due dilly was flawed. They have zero, as in nothing but massive losses. There is no gem here, just a lump of coal. How you didn't cut your losses is amazing. We are closing in on a 5 handle, buy more, you said you would..",2024-10-03
