"@texklassen Thank you! Lot of volatility right now in China and everything that is related to that. Can’t wait for Q3 earnings, I don’t think this China volatility is priced in, you won’t see it in the VIX",2024-09-27
@Emir Mulahalilovic but do you think they will increase or decrease share count in the coming years?,2024-09-15
"@Thomas Veth It's accounted for because the base year is current diluted share count. If you want to do it specifically for future periods, you'll need to add a variable of deducing how much FCF they spend on buybacks and detract it per period, while adding dilution. It's a more complex approach, I prefer my method.",2024-09-13
@Emir Mulahalilovic Ahh thanks I understand. How do we then take in to account that they have been buying back shares (are they continuing that in the future?)? Buybacks can have a pretty strong effect over the course of years...,2024-09-13
"Virtu, CME, and BTAL are my income-producing ""antifragile"" hedges against  market downturns. Unlike shorting and its option equivalents they add to rather than subtract from ongoing portfolio cash returns.",2024-09-11
"@Thomas Veth The increase in share count is to capture the dilutive effect of SBC, as the expense is added back to the operating profit. Since it's not a cash expense, I don't want it detracted from FCF, doing so would imply that the cash isn't available for leverage when it is in reality.If you reduce shares (i.e. buybacks) in a model, it's essentially double counting FCF, that's why it's an incorrect method. So, even if there was 0% dilution in a hypothetical scenario and no SBC, and they are buying back shares, it would still be wrong to reduce the share count per period as it's a cash expense. It would result in double counting FCF.Hope that helps!",2024-09-11
"Is there a reason you don't look at the future buybacks? or is the share count increase also based on the buybacks? Just asking, have not yet done deep research on this one",2024-09-10
