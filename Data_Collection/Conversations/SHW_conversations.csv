@bigfish1977 I know but a long time ago I researched LOW and HD.  It was when HD was having problems with Nardelli as CEO.  I picked LOW to start a position and I've added to it on dips.  HD eventually did get its act together.  Both are attractive.,2024-09-18

"@Carl Frederick Gauss I think we agree that this is a fundamentally sound company. The challenge is assessing whether the current market reflects its business value. While I have presented the DCF approach, in real life I look at 3 metrics to see whether they all point to undervaluation - DCF, Acquirer's Multiple and FCFF yield. I based the Acquirer's Multiple and FCFF yield on the past 3 years average earnings or Free Cash Flow. If I get a Acquirer's Multiple of < 7 and a FCFF yield of > 5% and the DCF is at market price, I would treat it as a go. But I would be interested to see how others look at the ""fair price"" for ""wonderful companies""",2024-09-17
"@Hong Chew Eu Thanks. Respectfully....some push back on using historical numbers....while it is definitely a mature industry the growth will continue with population growth and international expansion and possibly US housing start increases as we have been underbuilding for years. The housing starts may not materialize as housing affordability has declined dramatically over the past decade. I think they have gradually increased market share as well. They have been increasing margins too. Historically, they have grown cash flow by 11.5% annually for the past decade. I believe their recent increase in capex may decline. Management have made great decisions and they are an advantaged company - evidence is extremely high profitability numbers and solid acquisitions and buybacks. Analyst estimates are for double digit EPS growth. This company has been underestimated for years - evidence is the stock return of 414% in the past decade versus 184% for the SP500. I believe strongly this is a great company. My concern is the valuation and I struggle with this for high quality compounder stocks. For simplicity...they have averaged an EV to EBIT of 25 times for the past decade and currently are above that at 27.7. Admittedly, I think their future growth could be slower. I see this phenomenon of great compounders trading at very high valuations. This is an obvious thing to say but I have only seen this since the pandemic. I digress...but where are the great companies at fair values today? Sorry for rambling and I value different opinions and perspectives. I am still considering purchasing SHW and have regret missing this one for the past 20 years.",2024-09-17
"@Carl Frederick Gauss I am a long-term investor and as such I am trying to see where the company will be in 8 to 10 years down the road. Over this time frame, there will be new products, new markets and I suspect it will go through one or two business cycles. It is hard to figure out what the economics will look like on a year to year basis. So I ""cheat"" by looking at the past decade performance and guess whether the future will be the same, better or worse. I think the company is operating in a mature sector and most likely the future will be the same as the past. I doubt it will be worse since I have not seen any disruption. If I am lucky it will be better. If you look at my valuation, it is based on the past data and there is no margin of safety. So why take bet? If you do invest, it must be because you think that a) there will be tremendous growth b) it can continue to improve its operations c) there will be bigger acquisitions than those in the past.  Isn't this too much to ask?BTW, in my valuation, I only assumed that the company can improve the capital efficiency (revenue/TCE) based on its track record. But I did not assume any improvement in operation efficiency as reflected in the contribution margin since there is no track record of this.",2024-09-16
@Owen213 How much of an effect do you think interest rates have on their business or housing starts?,2024-09-16
Thank you for your article. I am trying to understand a bit about this industry and SHW position in it. Seems like this is a slow growth industry with about 5% annual growth in rev but SHW is likely to gain market share as they are the best in breed company. Your article if very focused on MBA type metrics and I appreciate that decomposing profits such are your DuPont  analysis can be helpful. Have you thoughts or comments that you would be willing to share about interest rates and housing starts and the effects this can have on the industry? What makes your feel that SHW can continue increasing margins?,2024-09-16
"@Owen213 But retail is about 10% of their business, right? 75% of their EBIT comes from the store segment and that's at least 90% contractors, true? Just seems like no one competes well with them. Any thoughts on the new CEO?",2024-09-13
"@Carl Frederick Gauss Around here you don't have too many options if you are a contractor, there's really only Sherwin and Ben Moore. SH pricing is competitive with the big box stores and their service is a lot better. Retail however is a different matter. Those sticker prices at SH will drive retail away",2024-09-12
"Sherwin Williams is one of the great *""natural gas bonanza""* winners selling a crazy valuable lifestyle Brand now very much in vogue known as *""sweat equity.""* A lot here not to like valuation wise especially so but if they can expand both their retail into selling applicators for paints and coatings plus something on the industrial side in particular automotive and might be able to not seem so scary as is currently true September 2024.",2024-09-09
