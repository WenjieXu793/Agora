"Does anyone have insight into why the sales team had such a level of attrition as to impact the company’s performance as stated? Yes, sometimes you have to reorganize and rebuild, but this seems to have had a significant impact on $ZS. I believe the price needs to drop under $125 before jumping back in. (I have owned share briefly a few years back)",2024-10-06
"@cobiacomm Agree with your concern-as I see SBC as one of the most important “drawbacks’ to ZS that there is. Admittedly, I am long the stock. I sure wish I had a better handle on the SBC issue. I am an adviser; Analysts: are you “listening??”",2024-10-06
Does your valuation model (calculating a $218 present value per share) include future share based compensation (SBC) dilution? How would future SBC lower the price target?,2024-10-06
"ZS problem is it issues too many shares.  from July 2023 to July 2024, it issued 800m shares, which is more than 20% of total shares. The ZS Rule of 40 does not take this into account, otherwise, Rule of 40 would be much less than 40.",2024-10-06
"I own shares of ZS for years now and consider adding.I like the development and also the management team and skin in the game. but technology and especialy cyber security is really crowded. In case of adding, the time is now.",2024-10-05
"I appreciate your positive analysis of the numbers but wonder how desirable their product is competitively.  What is the significance of securing based on ""policies?"" ""ZS is a cybersecurity vendor that is disrupting the traditional firewall model by instead securing based on policies""",2024-10-04
Absolutely not. A forward enterprise value/ebitda of 39 and a price/cash flow ratio of 33 make this an absolutely unappealing bet in a cybersecurity space that is difficult to pick a winner because the financial metrics are incredibly expensive and the competitive landscape is incredibly unknown.,2024-10-04
"Present market has a habit of beating up technology stocks no matter how good the revenue and growth are. They are short selling everything technology. I suspect the fix incoming honchos like Ritcher of Blackrock, the “mathematical modelers” of the revolution technology funds, and some.",2024-10-04
@Kirk Spano In order to get back to better there may be some resistance but that bit of resistance is far better for the future than the destruction we are seeing now.,2024-10-02
@boris gudonov Every one of these investment firms have a list. Maybe they're pitching their book. They want you to buy the price up! ;-),2024-10-02
"@golfcat1 we ought to control the border, but, we ought to be issuing enough work visas and green cards to offset Boomer retirements. That requires millions of immigrants per year.",2024-10-01
@santlo It won't. Markets will tank if the weird guys take over. They are a threat to democracy and capitalism.,2024-09-30
"@erbrown Don’t bet the farm on that. I don’t see cap gain tax on unrealized gains. For openers, evaluations are impossible, not only for the likes of farm land but also for 1000 shares of a publicly-traded stock, liquidity is a big deal. Then there’s the velue of the local family business. Not so fast.",2024-09-29
Stock Market at record levels under Biden-Harris …why will change  to Trump be better for market?,2024-09-29
ZS and CMG: 2 for 1 special. Trade ideas  I’m still in both these trades. Via “Shadow Trader” - 9/16youtu.be/...,2024-09-16
@slodon28 of course it will - just ask Milton Friedman. Spending leads to inflation (Why I sold any bond holding/ blended fund before 2022). Don't make this so hard.,2024-09-16
Still climbing and looking  good. We need to get through fed decision. If we can do that this could go a lot higher. All depends on QQQ,2024-09-16
@TJ Burke Wont all of that NEW that government spending increase inflation?,2024-09-16
Margins should continue to climb.  I feel good about ZS over the next 4-5 years.,2024-09-16
