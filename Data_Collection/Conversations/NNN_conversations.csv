"I've been NNN's advocate for a long time :) Happy shareholder. It provided the upside I expected, but with recent developments - I believe it still has more to offer. Thanks for a solid coverage, cheers!",2024-09-30
"Thank you for this nice piece on a core holding in my retirement account.  Love the stock, but it’s a little too pricey for me to add at the moment-I’d like to see the CRE market finish its’ refi shakeout before adding.  I wish I had bought a lot more last October!",2024-09-30
"@Bucknfl Great! And I guess that NNN has the lowest exposure in your portfolio, right?:)",2024-09-30
"Are you aware that the consensus analyst 12-month price target for NNN is $47.57, while NNN closed Friday at $48.30 (including the $0.15 increase after hours)?Oh NNNoooooooo!!!",2024-09-29
O ADC NNN  all moving higher. I bought NNN for diversification.,2024-09-29
"From time to time, I read that NNN could be an acquisition candidate.  I’d be surprised, but I suppose it’s possible.",2024-09-29
"Have owned NNN for over 13 years.  Every stock isn't going to be a home run, but this one is a steady performer, especially during all those years following the Great Recession when yields were next to nothing in other areas.",2024-09-29
"@grcinak o, adc, eprt = equity bond as well :) Have you invested in O, ADC or EPRT?",2024-09-29
"@Income4ever aka Cyclenut Good point as well. But I would say this - if O or ADC positions become too large and there is still an idea to invest in good quality retail REITs, I would feel comfortable adding a minor stake in NNN. Having said that, I'm not long NNN now...",2024-09-29
nnn  = equity bond ...  I have a full position...,2024-09-28
"Im not so sure about NNN..O is fantastic, NNN is somewhat overrated and underwhelming in my opinion... look at the 10 year charts compare ADC , O and NNN... its not even close",2024-09-28
So you think the fair value is $50? We are getting close.,2024-09-24
"@Bucknfl Thanks. You know pretty much nobody read this article, and it took two weeks for a single comment, which is a shame since this is a great company that is moving up the charts. I have a $45 strike call that expires on Friday, and I am still unsure as to whether I should sell, roll, or exercise the shares, but I should have bought a bunch of them when I bought this one.",2024-09-17
