"SG&A increased as they were developing a new flavor that's just being rolled out, it's not that they couldn't raise prices 2.5% to match inflation (which I believe was actually higher) it was because the higher input costs have come back down and they prefer to keep prices lower that increase them to drop them again in 3-6 mos.  Also, the 2 soft drink lines they have, Faygo & Shasta have profit margins of ~80% and those 2 lines had the fastest sales acceleration as they do every time there's inflation or the country is in a recession. In fact, that's the exact reason I initially bought the shares in the early 2000s.  I think your rational is a bit off.",2024-09-18
