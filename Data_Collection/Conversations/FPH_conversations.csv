Lennar largest shareholder ...seems like they are losing their chance to fold all these projects into their California biz before the shares take off on their own...maybe the share structure is slowing down a deal..IMHO,2024-09-30
Lennar LEN is the largest shareholder and a big partner on their Irvine project..now that earnings starting to roll in LEN running out of time to bring this whole company into the fold,2024-09-30

@AndrewCPA the stock broke out of its recent trading and volume on 9/25. 9/16 was a blip in trading.,2024-09-28
"@Newton100 Volume and movement started on 9/16.  Monday after the meeting.  While it might have been eventually expected, no one follows this stock.",2024-09-28
"@AndrewCPA I doubt the SF news had much, if any, impact. That was expected and that news had minimal stock impact. The price increase is due to one or two investors accumulating large stakes in the company and the end of the overhang from the Luxor selling.",2024-09-28
@Newton100 Robert Robotti bought a large chunk of the shares sold.  6.7 million per the SEC filing. There must have been another buyer for the rest.,2024-09-27
@SeattleGoldMiner they sold the 9 million yesterday. I wonder who bought the shares since it must have been pre-arranged. I am surprised they would sell when the company is doing dramatically better.,2024-09-25
@Dominick D'Angelo Luxor sold about 9mm shares in the past 4 trading days (probably crosses) and only has about 1mm left which they can leak out over time.  This would appear to remove a large overhang.  They also filed an 8-K recently extending their relationship with the owner of the Great Parks Community.  Can you comment on the change in terms for that 8-k and also your thoughts about Luxor finally moving on?? Through the year they meted out small amounts of stock if they were able to get >$3 for it and there was enough volume.,2024-09-25
