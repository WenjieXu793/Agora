Someone should buy them and straighten out the business.  Used to be a $1400 stock not too long ago.  Longz SAM!  :-),2024-09-29
"I follow this closely for my personal investing and owned it recently. I am very bearish currently on stocks, but I do like this one. I believe that it could be acquired. I like the balance sheet, which you called out, but I also like that management owns a lot.On the valuation, yes, it seems expensive, but I think that investors should and will compare it to its history. 1.5X enterprise value to sales (the 2024 projected sales), for example, is way below the level in 2019 of 4.2X. The enterprise value to adjusted EBITDA projected for 2024 is above the typical stock at 12.5X, but this is way below where it has been historically. Investors aren't buying a high valuation based upon inflated values for revenue or profitability. The current numbers have been hit hard!I look at the price to tangible book value for cash-rich debt-free high quality companies to help judge the downside. The current ratio of 3.5X is way above 1.0X, but the company is generating free cash flow.I don't own this one currently, but my wife does. She bought right before the rumors of potential acquisition came out in late May. I have traded in and out of it, but this stock bear hopes to get back in soon!",2024-09-29
