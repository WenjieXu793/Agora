"@jthom57 No on KOS. Took my gains long ago, and then stayed out as their path to ""cash flow inflection"" kept getting longer and longer.",2024-10-02
Took a new position at $54 earlier this year and will add if it breaks under $60 in the near term. Am comfortable holding for the future unless something fundamentally changes.,2024-10-01
Buy at $50 when it tanks Oct 28-Nov 4th. Cyclical cycle!,2024-10-01
It’s only paying 5.6%… so many better options… not interested…,2024-10-01
I agree it's still a buy. Could go to $80 under the right circumstances. I've got 700 shares bought at $55.,2024-09-30
Nice article! I started a position in WPC on Friday.,2024-09-30
"@CounterInvestor All you said should apply for many other stocks, REITs especially. Not all of them recovered fully, so it is a relative game.",2024-09-27
"@RushingAlpha I agree, having a tenant in such a bad financial condition and only recognizing the problem once the tenant can't pay their rent, that sounds like a mismanagement. But what shocks me is the permanent rent discount - does it mean that the market value of the property is such low that it can't be offered to anyone else for better conditions than that or sold?",2024-09-27
@Tony1112 Well it does depend where the money comes from. But if you raise cash by issuing stock and you use the 7.7% then the ROE is less than the AFFO yield today and any investment is initially cash-flow negative. Keep reading my articles and those by Chris Volk. Best wishes... Paul,2024-09-24
"Hi, Could you explain to me how do you from the CEO stating 'the average cap rate, over the length of their new leases, is 9% when the initial cash cap rate is 7.7%' to you thinking 'Doing transactions that are cash-flow negative will also reduce AFFO/sh and CFO/sh' ? Is your point that, while the average cap rate is 9%, the bottom investments with cap rate way below 9% will generate negative cash flows? The initial cap rate of 7.7% looks good to me and I just don't see how it turns to negative cash flow. I'm just starting to learn about investing in REITs and would like to know more. Thanks.",2024-09-24
@Lord TGO Investment Agreed...  but I wanted 3 pennies.  Perhaps next time.,2024-09-23
"@stormyhank No disrespect,  EPS is not the appropriate metric for reits...FFO, or more importantly AFFO - adjusted funds from operations is what's important",2024-09-20
"@Income4ever aka Cyclenut I think that their dividend exceeding their EPS supports the conclusion that they cannot really afford their dividend, let alone an increased dividend.",2024-09-20
"@toromi Yep, the safest dividend is the one that was just increased .. oh .. but Wait.. didnt we hear this once before ?",2024-09-20
"Nice one. Good revisit of the WPC thesis. I always doubt its token increase in dividends, even after the reset.",2024-09-20
@Income4ever aka Cyclenut Today you can lock in a 5.50% yield. May not seem like a lot but it will a year from now. Add capital appreciation and things are looking good. Long WPC as well.,2024-09-20
"You folks laugh at the .6% increase but with compounding, that is well over 2 cents annually",2024-09-20
@Locomotivus Your every every misinformed... WPC now has a very safe payout ratio.... much safer than before at 73.4%,2024-09-20
@RoseNose Most don't notice but increases since the reset are slightly more robust pace than last 5 years ... albeit it slightly,2024-09-20
"Wpc has now, since the dividend reset, demonstrated its tradition and commitment to continue quarterly increases at a slightly more robust pace than last 5 years with a much safer payout ratio of 73.4%Long Wpc",2024-09-20
