"@BigLRP Thanks for your question!Basically, I like the management team that has a track record in the company. There are a lot more questions if the management is new to the company. I think, the quality of the management is determined by the capital allocation decisions it makes. How it allocates the cash, share buybacks, dividends, reinvestment and acquisitions. I prefer to have a CEO who is also the founder of the company, but the ownership approach is definitely important. It's good if management's compensation is dependent on the company's results, but the key is that management should aim for a high return on capital and work on developing the core business.What tells a lot about Paccar's management is return on capital 12.24% vs sector median 7.19% This is quite big difference and there are a few other graphs in the Paccar's presentation which shows its strength in a competitive market which praises its management.",2024-10-05

"AXON is a trump trade. Over 150x P/EBITDA, I think around 100 P/E... worth 3 times Nividia? Give me a break. This is a total meme stock by now. It's actually quite frustrating. I bought puts on it with 12% of my portfolio and it has went up since the strike.. insanity. Just goes to show not to mess with meme stocks. At least I've made 40% on my portfolio with vix calls for the strike. I learned a serious lesson from this AXON trade and my past CVNA puts.",2024-10-01
"@Tamas Sandor When I changed jobs years ago my 401k account was in the mid 6 figures.  I did a lot of research on companies that use something akin to Capability Maturity Model Integration (CCMI).  Basically, CMMI is an extension of CMM used in software development.  That is, the company has put in place documented processes and procedures to ensure that the company's products are consistently high quality with minimal issues.  PCAR is one of those companies.",2024-10-01

"@cyclingscholar That's a good question, and to be honest, I don't have the answer. I guess they'll continue to maintain strong special dividends, as earnings are still expected to be strong overall. Thanks for reading!",2024-09-29
Great company. My longest holding and it has been a very good one.,2024-09-27
Do you think the rather extraordinary special dividends at the end of the year will be continued or scaled back some?,2024-09-27
One of the best run companies in the US.  Buy on the dip!,2024-09-27
