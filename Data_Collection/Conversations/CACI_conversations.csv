If you calendarize the earnings for '25 and give them some credit for the expected 4% earnings accretion you get $25+ in eps. So it's a slight discount to the S&P at 19X calendar '25. Seems a reasonable valuation for a company that has been executing well and is not economically sensitive.,2024-09-18
