"@PA Research PLTR has been a part of my portfolio since their IPO and I added a couple hundred shares on the way down, most below 15$. I haven’t realized any gains in the past 5 years and thought it was time for a new watch. As much as I love this company, my portfolio strategy can’t justify holding a stock at 200+P/E. I plan on buying back in eventually but I am seeing better opportunities elsewhere right now. GLTA!",2024-10-06
@i like stats there are other competitors who offer similar solutions. A forward P/E of 100 is too much,2024-10-06

This stock reminds me of MRNA.   It kept going up and anyone who questioned the value was an idiot because it was the next great thing.    It made it close to $500 before it crashed and now it is at $60.    PLTR will not drop as much because they are the real deal but they will drop and most likely will start after the Nov 1 earnings.   Anyone that thinks they will not have a lot of competition in the future does not follow technology.,2024-10-06

"@nickatyme Glad MU is paying off for you. I’m underwater on my last options trade I made earlier on MU, which was an in the money long call option when the stock was trading at $130. Since I made that trade, I’ve been surprised at how weak the stock has performed, as it tanked into the 80’s and recovered only modestly to low 100’s following their most recent earnings report. I have had a string of successful trades, but not this most recent one. Seems with MU there is often hype about how good things are going to be in the future, but that is the constant theme, and the results don’t seem to ever live up to that hype. They’ve got some federal government funding wind at their back, which should help. Without it, makes you wonder where the stock might be trading?As for PLTR, you seem rather obsessed with what you refer to as insider trading, which is really nothing more than insiders cashing in some equity rather than being invested with all of their eggs in one basket.If you aren’t long the stock, I would wonder why you would be bothering to take the time to follow PLTR and obsessing over it? That is unless you’re short? Me wonders about you, because you appear quite compelled to continuously beat the drum and insist that PLTR investors avoid the stock or head for the exits. It’s as if you are working overly hard to attempt to create panic among investors in efforts to drive the price of the stock down. That’s why me thinks you might be short big fella with an agenda here. Am I right?",2024-10-06
"@john.fAIrplay Thanks for the comment John. You might own the same amount of shares but the pie increased by 100% effectively you own 50% less of the company. I have to correct the ""shares"" wording. Yes market value increased, because other people are willing to pay more to buy the shares from you. I don't see a material increase in intrinsic value since the IPO",2024-10-06
@Always Sunny In Thailand Thank you for the comment. A company that raises capital from the market to grow is still in the start-up/growth phase,2024-10-06
"@PA Research - ""diminished shareholder value over the past 3 years"" and ""If you were an owner since 2021 now you own 50% less shares.""This is just nonsense - you have it almost precisely backwards.  I own the same number of shares I bought at the IPO, and they're worth 4 times as much.",2024-10-06

"@Jdberwanger2 I don’t hold any position nor plan to establish one within the next months.You can pay 200x for earnings of  400M or 20x for earnings of 400M, what changes is the market’s perception of the future.In my opinion, If you choose the first, there should be some reasoning for doing so.",2024-10-06
@USSTOCKCHASER you are right. It doesn’t. Shouldn’t however a rally driven by momentum eventually stop? Is an investment successful because market value increases or because the business fundamentals improved?,2024-10-06
@Krypto Good strategy...and try to find other PLTRs. Best of luck.,2024-10-06
"The strategy of getting out of a stock when becomes ""overvalued"" and back in when it's ""correctly valued"" is a lot different for retirement accounts versus taxable accounts. Pltr is up 240% in the last 30 months, so if you're taxed on the gain, you'd be paying a 15% ""exit fee"" to get to the sidelines.",2024-10-06
"Every once in a while, a company comes along whose stock can make a difference in your wealth. The 1st for me was AAPL. Bought 200 shares for $12/share in 1980-something. I've held ever since. Apple taught me you invest in a thesis and a company's ability to pull off the thesis...their management. (I do not like it when people tell of their successes but I think it's important here.)Since the 1980's do you have any idea how many articles there have been about selling AAPL because it was too pricey?When you are dealing with a disruptive company in a disruptive niche , a company that is a monopoly and years and years ahead of people trying to catch up, with the stock, discounting Options:1) You can feverishly try to time....that is certainly a winning strategy for a retail investor, or 2) Just hold until the thesis changes...typically holding for years.If you are new to PLTR think tranches and DCA.Re PLTR, make a decision and move on. If you have been reading these types of articles for several months and you don't understand the company by now you will likely never understand it.I've moved on in my planning....still checking some articles but losing interest in the ""it's too expensive"" articles.I'm holding and adding on real drops NOT created by a change in thesis. I've moved on to RKLB, ACHR and JOBY. You can get in very close to the ground with disruptive companies in disruptive niches not yet that well known to the public and too small for run of the mill institutional investors. Do your DD, at least 30-hours per company to understand why them and not LUNR or BLDE, for instance. Study until you understand what is the difference in corporate culture between ACHR and JOBY and how will that difference likely play out?  When you know a company at that level you will not worry about ""Is the s/p too high?"" when it adds to your wealth.",2024-10-06
"I don't mind stock dilution, if I buy for $20 and sell for $40, what does it matter? My number of shares doesn't change and my profit will not shrink. So I don't understand all this talk about stock dilution and less profits.",2024-10-06
@Stock Info I am holding with a basis of $24. It’s been a good ride this year!,2024-10-06
"@Krypto graham’s point was that a fair value is P/B=1 pay more, and you have to make sure those future earnings will materialize. A current P/B of 21 when half of book is APIC sets the earnings multiple to 42. If we assume 10 is a fair multiple for a growth tech stock, that means 4x current earnings or $1.6B to be a fairly valued. What is the catalyst for a NI of $1.6B in the near future?",2024-10-06
"@ITSALLBS thank you for your comment. I don’t see any value nor a lasting competitive advantage in a newly founded startup. If you were an owner since 2021 now you own 50% less shares. Most of the price appreciation is driven by momentum and assumptions, I just don’t see value here….",2024-10-06
