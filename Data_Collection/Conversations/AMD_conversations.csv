"Author - ""Despite AMD's weak competitive position against Nvidia...""Where the hell did I leave my bear spray? AMD has a clear competitive advantage over NVDA. In case you missed it...How does Nvidia's multi-chip design compare to AMD's chiplets?First a little background. In the old days node shrink was the driving force to achieve more compute. This became known as Moore's Law which says the number of transistors in a chip roughly doubles every two years with minimal cost increase. Decades passed with massive increase in compute while cost essentially stayed the same. Unfortunately nothing lasts forever. Transistors continue getting smaller but at increased cost and difficulty.Multi-chip (MC) design and chiplet design both seek to maximize compute in response to the diminishing returns of Moore's Law. As each design technique is pressed to its limit the distinction between them sometimes becomes blurry. But there are hallmarks which distinguish MC from chiplets.Described simply, MC combines two or more chips together in a single package while leaving the design quite similar to what each chip would be if packaged as a stand-alone unit. Each chip has a monolithic design. That's the hallmark of MC. The term monolithic literally translates as ""one stone"". This means all functionality necessary is contained on the chip to make it self-sufficient. Monolithic design is a consequence of Moore's Law. As ever more transistors become available there is an incentive to aggregate more functionality and performance into one chip.But cramming all that capability into a single chip has made monolithic chips physically bigger. High performance monolithic designs tend to be quite large. Nvidia's Blackwell is an MC design. The package contains eight stacks of 24GB HBM plus two 800mmÂ² monolithic GPU chips. Each GPU chip is at the reticle size limit. Which implies those GPU chips can't get any bigger due to optical limitations of lithography. Designing chips of such size is problematic as nodes continue to shrink. Smaller transistors provide more targets for defects in a given area. Large chips have more area and thus greater opportunity for a defect to wipe out a chip.There's also a dire issue looming ahead. Chip lithography will soon reach optical limits which demand a reduction in reticle size. Specifically this happens when the node process gets smaller than 1.8nm. At that point high numerical aperture (high-NA) EUV becomes a necessity. It has only half the reticle size of current EUV. Thus staying with monolithic design would force existing functionality into half the space. Even though node shrink will make more transistors available, the abrupt reduction in reticle size will be a severe restriction for chip designers. Any design which relies on a large chip to provide sufficient compute power will be in trouble.In the near term Nvidia might just keep doubling and tripling down on MC design. Rubin will likely be MC because the node process is 3nm and thus doesn't suffer from reticle size reduction which only happens below 1.8nm nodes. In the longer term MC design will be confronted with integrating lots of much smaller chips. Almost sounds like chiplets.Chiplets are an alternative to MC design. However it's not simply connecting a bunch of smaller monolithic chips. Neither is it busting up a large monolithic chip into pieces and stitching them back together. Chiplets are about functional disaggregation of traditional monolithic chip design. It has to be done thoughtfully from the ground up. Anything less won't work which is why INTC's Ponte Vecchio (PV) sucks. According to Jim Keller PV is just a monolithic design divided into pieces called tiles and stitched together with EMIB (2.5D) and Foveros (3D) packaging. So INTC really doesn't understand chiplets even though they probably believe otherwise. But proof is in the results. PV in Aurora will use 3x more power for the same compute as MI300A in El Capitan. That's a staggering difference in performance. Obviously AMD has a lead on INTC with NVDA even further behind the chiplet learning curve. Chiplets are not easy. PV is dead on arrival because INTC implemented chiplets poorly.So let's talk about chiplets done right. AMD began the chiplet journey years ago with Zen. It started with baby steps and was an evolutionary process. First Zen EPYC server CPU Naples was actually an MC design composed of four 8-core Zeppelin dies. Each Zeppelin die was a self-contained monolithic chip with compute, IO, and a homegrown interconnect called Infinity Fabric. AMD packaged those monolithic chips into an unprecedented 32-core server CPU at a reasonable price. Beauty of Zen was not skin deep. Those Zeppelin dies could be packaged as one die for Ryzen, two dies for Ryzen Threadripper, or four dies for EPYC. AMD used a modular chip design to attack INTC in mainstream desktop, high-end desktop, and performance server markets. It was an audacious strategy where one AMD chip challenged many INTC chips across three markets. In response INTC released a statement dismissing AMD as gluing chips together. Denial is the first stage of grief.AMD's Zen 2 product Rome was a true chiplet design. Functional separation is the hallmark. In this case IO and compute were put on different dies. Disaggregated design had a distinct advantage. It allowed AMD to use 7nm for compute and 14nm for IO. Scarce allocation of the more expensive 7nm node at TSMC could be dedicated to compute dies for higher performance. While a less expensive 14nm node from GlobalFoundries made the IO die. What's interesting is IO performance didn't suffer because IO circuitry is less demanding.Zen 3 Milan followed Rome with double the compute cores, optional disaggregated 3D V-Cache, and improved Infinity Fabric which reduced inter-core latency. Milan-X used SoIC for the 3D V-Cache. At this time AMD also pushed Instinct GPU into the limelight with MC designed MI250X for Frontier. Milan and MI250X won the exascale project over traditional contenders like IBM, INTC, and NVDA. In the past, lilliputian AMD competed with behemoths IBM and INTC to sometimes win the CPU for supercomputer projects. But no matter who won the CPU it was NVDA that always provided GPU if this was also needed. With Frontier AMD won both CPU and GPU in a clean sweep. Remarkably GPU performs over 99% of compute in Frontier. Thus winning Frontier was a milestone for the Zen-like ascendance of AMD's long dormant GPU. An interesting aside is GPU MI250X has an MC design just like CPU Naples. AMD is running the same Zen-like playbook in GPU as it did in CPU. Frontier got the ball rolling for AMD's GPU renaissance. It's a feather in the cap for AMD.Zen 4 Genoa came next and offered even more cores. Including compact Zen 4c cores for Bergamo and Siena. Infinity Fabric evolved into Infinity Architecture which enabled CPU-GPU coherency for long sought Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA). This will have important implications for the future as AMD adds more goodies to their chiplet designs. AMD also reused CPU core chiplet dies (CCDs) from Genoa in chiplet designed Instinct MI300A to win their second exascale project El Capitan. So following AMD's Zen-like playbook, development of the MI300 series is much like Rome as both are the first chiplet designs in their respective domains. Winning El Capitan vindicates AMD's versatile and effective chiplet technology by doubling the performance of what previous generation Frontier does. Meanwhile INTC's power hog PV in Aurora finally reached exascale performance in May. But struggling Aurora is still limping along at half capacity while burning massive power and hasn't yet matched smaller Frontier.Much has changed since the dark days before Zen. AMD is stronger now and seeking AI greenfield opportunity. Notably the chiplet design of MI300A for El Capitan enabled the rapid deployment of MI300X early this year as a variant to address the booming AI market. Upgrade MI325X arrives later this year and MI350X comes next year. AI beast MI400 is scheduled for release in 2026.At this point INTC is seriously wobbling. NVDA is feeling competition for the first time with AMD's Instinct. Recent setback of Blackwell reveals stress at NVDA in response to pressure from AMD. Monolithic design of NVDA products will have difficulty competing with the more nimble and flexible chiplet design paradigm used by AMD. While NVDA might compete awhile using MC and fast interconnect that won't hold for long. AMD already has fast interconnect as demonstrated in exascale supers Frontier and El Capitan. Industry heavyweights are joining AMD to adopt Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) based on Infinity Fabric and combining it with ultra-Ethernet. This new industry standard will transform NVDA's proprietary fortress into a prison for their customers. Folks will be jumping from the Infiniband walls and swimming the CUDA moat to get out.AMD's roadmap for CPU and GPU looks good. Clearly chiplet design when done right is very powerful. In retrospect it's now obvious that INTC's fate was sealed the moment they dismissed chiplets. INTC's hubris and arrogance doomed them.NVDA seems to be making the same mistake.",2024-10-06

"In case you missed it...From a chip design perspective NVDA's Blackwell is not impressive. Two reticle-sized monolithic dies lashed together pushes a tired chip design philosophy to the breaking point. Blackwell's 2.27x performance gain over H100 comes mostly from doubling down on the huge dies. After backing out this doubling effect what's left is a 14% improvement per die.https://tinyurl.com/44z94v5r (AnandTech - NVIDIA Blackwell Architecture - 3/18/2024)Almost half of that 14% gain is due to TMSC's N4P node for Blackwell versus N4 for H100. Both N4 and N4P are actually members of the TSMC 5 nm process family. Though Jensen tends to omit this detail in all his hype. N4P offers 11% better performance to N5 while N4 has only 5%. So knock 6% off the 14% gain with the remainder due to enhancements from NVDA's illustrious chip design team. That 8% is not much to crow about. But pesky math won't stop Jensen from more chest thumping.https://tinyurl.com/mry9zzys (TSMC - N4P Process - 10/26/2021)In any event NVDA took their best shot and it was lackluster. Blackwell will be clobbered by the MI350 series in 2025 with CDNA 4 having a 35x increase in performance compared to MI300X's CDNA 3. But before then there's MI325X in Q4 with 288GB of HBM3E and 1.3x more performance than competitive offerings. That should minimize any advantage claimed by NVDA when Blackwell is released in Q4 2024 or Q1 2025. Blackwell gets only a brief moment in the sun before it is eclipsed.https://tinyurl.com/2s37nzjx (AnandTech - AMD Lays Out Accelerator Roadmap to 2026 - 6/2/2024)Things don't look better for Rubin either. It's dead on arrival when facing MI400. NVDA's lack of proficiency in chiplets dooms Rubin in 2026 to be a double or triple down version of Blackwell. Assuming the problem with CoWoS-L gets fixed, expect four or six giant reticle-sized monolithic dies lashed together ad nauseam. In this case more is not better because it uses lots of power. This increases operating expenses. Huge dies are also vulnerable to defects. Thus the low yield makes them pricey. Jensen just passes the cost on to the customer. Folks will be eager for alternatives from AMD.Meanwhile NVDA will be spending billions designing the same lame stuff again and again.",2024-10-06
