"@sts66 , Yes, in thinking about that particular issue further it seems rather minor.  I did see planted 'news' article regarding the need to build bus barns for them being an additional cost to implement a fleet.  Arguable.The larger picture to me is BLBD had an outsized gain and the shorts, like a pack of Hyena, are trying to take as much of it as they can.  Smaller market cap stocks like this are tempting targets.  It makes it tough on smaller investors.  Additionally, it is just a transportation sector manufacturer though, so I wouldn't expect huge gains again either.  Interesting to watch it play out.",2024-10-05
Manipulation at is best! I'll just keep adding before it takes off again.,2024-10-05
"@TwoFranks You know what is a red flag for me? When a company's stock deviates completely from the company's fundamentals. That's what we have here. Rising prospects, rising revenues, rising profits, falling stock. There can only be one possible explanation for that. Manipulation. How do you manipulate a stock price if you're a big broker? Downgrade the stock on baseless speculation about funding. Suggest a crisis in the boardroom without any real supporting evidence. Bingo. Your friends get in cheap and it's off to the races again. Don't even need to issue an upgrade. The fundamentals tell it all. How ironic is this situation? If one buys a spec stock, they are criticized for ignoring its fundamentals. But here we have a stock with great fundamentals and one is criticized for ignoring noise around government funding and some boardroom snafu. Might as well just throw in the towel.",2024-10-04
"@TwoFranks Let’s see…First of all. It’s twice, which is not « like three». Secondly, the first time was because the new guy was poached by Holley. So…simple enough explanation. Hardly the revolving door of C-suite types known as Tesla. How about their financials? Backlog? Revenues?Profits? Nope, no concerns there. But who cares about that stuff?",2024-10-04
@EKING44_00 downgrade from Roth MKM saying they are concerned about some of the funds for alternative vehicles may not be released in a timely manner. Buy to Hold.,2024-10-04
"@wboz , Not mumbo jumbo at all.  I will occasionally look at the finviz list of double bottom charts for candidates.  They're my favorite.  I caught BLBD at ~46 recently and sold for a 11% gain in a week.  I also pointed out the large short float to the longs of another BLBD article at that time.  They protested my lack of commitment.  No worries.  I always respect the shorts ability to take their bite when I least expect it, thus I took the small quick gain.I took the proceeds from that and entered a position in OXY at ~50 and doubled down at 52.  I not only use the basic chart, I go by investor sentiment.  When I see people showing a strong negative bias it causes me to watch the chart closely.  VZ worked out well for me earlier this year for example.  I sold.Based on your technical observations and the most recent developments, BLBD is probably off my list of candidates at this point as I'm not interested in going truly long on it at this point in time.  cheers...",2024-10-03
"@Agbug I could have clarified, that thoroughly modern ICE engines produces so little emissions they are much more pleasant to be around. Gas more so than diesel; though you can still put a diesel in a semi-enclosed shop and be okay. Diesels are tricky because they don't completely combust except at certain load profiles, meaning not the entire RPM range. We would do far better to eliminate old diesels from the roadways than leaving them in place, then insisting that all new car sales need to be EV powered.One shouldn't think I am negative on all electrification; far from it, only the concept of carting around millions of pounds of rocks unnecessarily. A school bus isn't that heavy or fast, so it could probably be comfortably moved using the mild hybrid from a Toyota Tundra. Regenerative brakes capture energy when students are let off, ready to be used to accelerate again; not that much power is needed trundling along at 30mph. This would be a much better solution than asking for taxpayer giveaways to buy $400K vehicles - and we should also be asking ""why does it cost them so much to make it?""I have only just looked at Blue Bird today. From a technical perspective, I would have deep concerns. There is a big gap from when the stock gapped up. And if it goes down to fill that, then the 50MA will push down through the 200MA in the ""death cross"", which I forgive anyone for thinking is mumbo jumbo, but important in the sense that OTHER people ALSO see this stuff and react.I've gotten sort of decent at teaching myself how to enter positions effectively. The selling of them, though less critical (bc you don't HAVE to sell but you have to buy) ... is very much WIP for me.  Of course, all bets are off if you have news-driven stocks like, it seems, this one.",2024-10-03
Have been looking at this company but it's very worrisome that the current CEO has retired like three times in the last couple of years but keeps being brought back after his replacements leave soon after taking the job.Something doesn't feel right.,2024-10-03
@prescot excellent. This analyst gives no reason whatsoever . Did the EPA call him especially and tell him something. Useless statement  I’ve read for awhile. Pity they cant sue for manipulation . I’m buying and topping up. Ignore the useless noise.,2024-10-03
"@Truth in Tension Just to be clear, would you be fine with the government modernizing the school bus fleet if the buses ran on traditional fuel?  (Yes, the government uses tax money. That's what they do.)",2024-10-03
@prescot What took him so long to take a swing at BLBD? It zoomed from $18 to $57 in less than one year (likely due to award of the EV bus contract) before trickling down to it's current pps of $44 - that's still a +144% in < 1 yr return..,2024-10-03
"@LenceFlatu What do you mean by "" this one far better than with what is going on with NASA and there we are talking tens of billions annually.""? If you're talking about cost over-runs and failures of the Boeing Starliner, I agree - billions over budget, still way behind schedule, no 100% successful flights yet - but Musk built the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket for the same mission on pretty much his own dime and delivered it's first cargo to the ISS way back in 2012 - only took 5 yrs from start of development until it's first successful test launch and recovery of the reusable vehicle. In 2014 NASA awarded Boeing a $4.2B to build Starliner, while SpaceX got $2.6B to develop the Crew Dragon capsule, which successfully delivered it's first human cargo to the ISS in 2020. Still waiting on Boeing, and will be waiting for at least another year after the most recent failure of the crew capsule - that's called a boondoggle.",2024-10-03
"@LenceFlatu , It looks like the cost of an EV school bus approaches $400K though.  That doesn't include some very significant charging capacity to go along with them.  As another comment I read noted, they would also likely need to be stored in a heated bus barn overnight in colder climates as well.OTH, in areas with sufficient, or in some cases excess solar capacity, they would make a good electron sink if mass deployment ever came to be.",2024-10-03
"If the going rate on a School Bus is $100,000 US Dollars all in 10 would be one million, 100 would be ten million, 1000 would be 100 million dollars an 10,000 would be one billion US Dollars unless I did that wrong. That doesn't like a lot of school buses to me for one billion US Dollars but maybe there can be added to that charging infrastructure on site to include solar charging and on site battery power. That could save taxpayers a fortune at the local level and ""deliver the goods"" namely the kids on the bus maybe some job training on site for same kids as well in bev work. Not sure how much has been invested already but there is a lot to be said as positive with this one far better than with what is going on with NASA and there we are talking tens of billions annually.",2024-10-03

This is one of the most obvious cases of corrupt stock manipulation I have ever seen. Roth Capital should be investigated. There is nothing here besides unfounded speculation about leadership and funding. It’s transparently dishonest and cynical.,2024-10-03
"This is so funny to me.  Some analyst who doesn't know any more about the inner workings at the EPA than any of us puts out a narrative and it drives the stock price down 6% (as I write this).  Of course all the government agencies have a hard time doing anything efficiently.  The money will probably be released inefficiently...that's how government works.  Then the analyst says he believes in the leadership at Bluebird but he's also concerned about the turbulence in leadership.  If that isn't mashed up double talk I don't know what is.  Only time will tell if he's correct or not on the EPA spend and leadership, but again the whole analyst racket is funny to me.  To me this analyst didn't put out anything concrete enough to change my view on the company.  I'm long and staying long at this point.",2024-10-03
Good move. Drive the price down on BS and then pick up more under 45!  Gonna keep adding here.,2024-10-03
Surprising how markets follow these reports. Just some firm guessing about future. Then in few more days or weeks another firm upgrade. It keeps going like this fore ever.,2024-10-03
