"AI will probably help ADP's bottom line as much as it will hurt it.  The whole picture is very fuzzy at present.  I wouldn't panic.  AI is one thing, but tailoring it to do all the things ADP does is another.",2024-10-01
"Obviously an AI written article.  I certainly wouldn't describe Workforce Software that way... ""WorkForce Software specializes in customized payroll solutions that allow employees to transfer paid time off and pay people time-and-a-half when they sleep in after a long shift.""I love Time and Attendance (aka Workforce Management) software that pays my employees time and a half when they sleep in! hahahahaha!",2024-09-27
"@Craig Lehman The picture at the top of the article is when I published my first article on ADP in September 2023 and the return since then. And back then the price was $243 and then I saw them as fairly valued but at $277 in September 2024 I see them as overvalued.Klarna is one of the biggest buy-now-pay-later companies in Europe, so they are kind of a big fish overseas. youtu.be/...In this video, Klarna's CEO talks about working closely with OpenAI, and he says that for them, using AI is like what they did before, but on steroids. He believes that within 6 to 12 months they will be launching things that will be truly disruptive.",2024-09-14
"At the top of the article, you say that as of the date of publication (Sept 14) the price of ADP is 243.87. In fact it is 277.51. It would help to get this right for your discussion of valuation. Were you saying it was overvalued at 243 or 277?Excuse my ignorance, but I'd never heard of Klarna; I had to look it up. A link to the story you're referencing would have been helpful. The article I found (www.msn.com/...) indicated considerable industry skepticism about their course of action in ditching Salesforce and Workday, so I would have liked some discussion of how serious the threat to ADP really is.",2024-09-14
"The Klarna announcement was interesting for sure. But as someone who does AI, I will offer these insights:1. I doubt most (> 90%) of companies can be as innovative, IN THE SHORT TERM. Long-term (20+ years)? who knows.2. You have to have the data (systems of record) to act against. so for instance, if your strategy is to buy Salesforce and Workday to collect the data, then dump the systems, but keep the data, it is ""possible"".3. Even with #3, you have to have the transactional capabilities to conduct business going forward for the purposes of what Salesforce and Workday are designed for.4. But for the analytics and insights, sure. So that could easily harm future revenues of Salesforce and Workday. But there are MANY companies that will choose to build, not buy.All that to say, the Klarna case is interesting. But the core capabilities of ADP are still critical.",2024-09-14
"@Dividend Streamer I believe that a good management team will be able to use AI to create positive effects for their companies, but I also believe that AI will create big problems for many companies. It is interesting to note in this context that Open AI O1 scores close to 100 on intelligence tests, which would be the equivalent of an average human being. Chat GPT 4 was at ~82 IQ. What happens when the models reach the level of an exceptional or highly gifted person? And it is happening fast. I would not be surprised if next year we have models that reach 115+, which would be in the 85th percentile. Here is a link where the models are tested. https://trackingai.org/IQ",2024-09-14
ADP has one of the most impressive buyback records of any quality stock.  The share count is just evaporating!  So it isn't just about dividends here.,2024-09-13
