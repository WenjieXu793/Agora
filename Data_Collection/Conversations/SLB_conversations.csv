"I wandered into the discussion about SLB/CHX when checking out other service companies.  At the time, Champion was worth almost $40 and, with the decline in SLB, now $30 on a good day.  I do understand that SLB's prospects are directly related to oil pricing, but is there more?SLB is one of the very few US oil service firms that has maintained operations in Russia.  Certain equipment is restricted because of advanced technology, but SLB has been keeping the operations limping along.The kernel of my concern is that surely the presence of more Russian crude on the grey market is not lost on Chevron or Shell and others.  It is, as a politician might describe, ""not helpful.""My question to the audience leans two ways.  Big oil competes but also sometimes makes accommodations.  Would it have greenlighted SLB to maintain operations in Russia to keep that business in Western hands rather than the Chinese?  It is not unthinkable.Another plausible thought is that SLB calculated that they would gain a lot of Russian market share by sticking around, but their activity, which brought all that oil to China and India, was not appreciated by the majors and they have lost other business to Baker and other oilfield service providers.  Even the Arab countries with large projects might look elsewhere rather than reward SLB.In that view, SLB isn't doomed but their outlook is cloudy.",2024-09-28
@The Energy Realist What is your current assessment of the prospects for SLB in view of Saudi Arabia showing an inclination to increase production? Just how large an impact would the latter have on SLB revenues and income?,2024-09-26
@ISTJ Investor That is correct. I like to differentiate estimates with facts given that fiscal years do not align with every company.,2024-09-19

@PapaWhisky probably estimated Q3 2024 and estimated second half (I.e Q3+Q4) 2024,2024-09-18
Lack of standardization of AI models will slow implementation and hurt profitability of AI vendors. AI is in many ways anti-Excel — one size fits all — and infinitely more complex. Imagine Nike having to make a million tailored sneakers instead of a few dozen sizes.,2024-09-17
"I have opened a sizable position today.  That said, the cycle may have the stock drift a lot lower before it swings slowly higher. If this is the case then I'll double down.",2024-09-16
"Late Saturday night alert:SLB has now declined enough in price that I find it very appealing. Despite my over-weighted position in the energy sector, I am inclined to initiate a position in SLB on Monday.I am deferring my final decision until I am sober.",2024-09-14

@grewalg87 who are the big boys exactly in oil rig technologies and means? Don't name the oil barrel producers pkease,2024-09-10
"with stuff like this it's always better to bet on the big boys, they got the research, and firepower to get it done. I remember everyone investing in small cap lithium names during covid, and now they all down 80-90% lol",2024-09-10
