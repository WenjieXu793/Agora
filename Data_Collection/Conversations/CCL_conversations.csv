"Thanks for this article.  If I were to buy a turnaround candidate , Carnival would be a good choice.  I own RCL, and I'm up 35%, not a huge amount, but RCL is further along than Carnival in getting back to normal.  It reinstated a dividend this year.  I'll continue to hold RCL.  Meanwhile, I suspect you are correct that Carnival will do well over the next 24 months.",2024-10-08 10:45:40.356276
@Bill the Bag Man agree.  At a macro level the weekly summary that would be somewhat useful would be the number of companies that reported positive earnings growth or revenue growth net inflation.  Of which I think only CCL did.  Would need to check.  But otherwise not a very helpful metric.,2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
Do companies ever really guide earnings very high? No. They guide on the conservative cautious side. Usually that is why an equity tanks if they miss or guide lower. Nothing earth shattering and it is not saying much about the macro economic picture.,2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"The cruise industry isn't one of my strong points.I am long CCL and NCLH.These investments required much due diligence but barring another worldwide disaster the likes of the Covid-19 pandemic, I expect that people buying at the current prices will realize outsize gains as long as they have the patience to wait for the companies to recover from the devastation caused by the pandemic.Some recreational activities can not be recovered after the time period is missed.  Cruises don't fall into the same category.If someone belonged to a bowling league and the bowling alley was forced to close, they may return to the league after the business is allowed to reopen, but the income that the bowling alley lost will not be recovered.Restaurants are an extreme example of this happening.  Last year I spent some time in Manhattan.  For the most part things are back to normal.  The amount of former restaurant locations that are permanently closed is quite high.There are people that are cruise ""regulars"" but I believe the majority of cruise customers will postpone rather than cancel their plans for their much anticipated cruise.I expect CCL to realize much of this postponed demand.  Higher occupancy rates will equate to higher fares as there won't be the need to discount fares as heavily to fill the ships.  Everything from the casinos to the one day excursions to the souvenir sales will have higher profits.Anchors Aweigh!!",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@JR Research The bears said this company would sink for sure.  The monthly dock fees and ship payments were huge !  Not a dime was received from Washington.  Despite this, Carnival will return to its former glory.  This is a well run company !",2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
"IMHO, unit economics are required to understand Carnival, its peers, and the other sectors and industries against which it competes.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@Ryan Garcia Yes...$20b or below -but remember, they have almost 70% more revenue than RCL.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
Love this stock!! Has a great trading range between earnings. Tends down to just below $15 stays in a nice trading range for a month. Then tends up to $18.50 starting three weeks before earnings! I buy and sell this sell this stock twice a week. Hope it never changes’,2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
They need to lower the debt to 20-22b (similar to that of RCL) for a bigger upside. I think it is very feasible by end of 2025.,2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
"Okay, I'll bite: how is CCL not as a good a buy as RCL whena) they have similar EPS...b) CCL has better revenue growth...c) RCL's debt is $22 billion, not much lower than CCL's $26b (or so), butd) RCL's revenue is approx $15b while CCL's is approx $24b?",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
Very good Q3 report today EPS $1.26 revenue plus 15% YOY 2024 EBITDA now 6.0B up from 5.8B,2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
They have really turned around the business but still have some ways to go on the balance sheet and the amount of shares outstanding have doubled since the pandemic. If we hit a recession forget about it.,2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@Bitzap if we want to be precise, the number of shares is 84% ​​higher than before Covid (710k) and the same from summer of 2022 (1310k). At that time, the number of shares did not increase. The price thus corresponds to the old price of USD 33 based on the current USD 18.",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@Bitzap This is correct, and perhaps does not go far enough.While I'm not a bear on the stock, i have no position.  I would note that the share count has risen from (pre-covid): 690 million to current: 1.26 billion.  As you noted, this is just shy of double.  However, in addition to this long-term debt (pre-covid) was under $10 billion.  Today, it is over $27 billion (off its recent high of $32 billion).Its enterprise value is now $12 billion higher than pre-covid, despite the lower share price, so the market is aware of the total value here, there are just a lot more shares and dollars of debt to divide it across.",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@Bitzap this is true! But taking into account the company's current turnover and profit figures, the inflation during the time that has passed since then was undoubtedly very depressed by this price.",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
@k1911 Sure.  Just pointing out that 18 USD stock price today is equivalent to about 36 USD-ish before COVID.,2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@Bitzap the current share price (18USD) includes these risks. Despite this, the real value of the company is significantly higher than the market price. Covid has battered these companies, but bankruptcy has been avoided, debt is being reduced, and passenger number and profit is constantly at its peak. These companies are good investments compared to many other companies.",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
@k1911 @Moats and Monopolies It's not just debt but outstanding shares / dillution.  There are almost twice as many shares now than before 2020.,2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
@robthediver And I hope you used the shareholder bonus program for each one of those.  Cheers!,2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
People are still loaded with money and they are not shy about spending either.,2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
