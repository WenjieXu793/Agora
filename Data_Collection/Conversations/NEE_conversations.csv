"@Babinjo agree, while it might not dip into the low 60s ever again perhaps, I'd consider adding at technical support AND if the fundamentals are still sound even if it does hit the 60s",2024-10-03
@Hunting Alpha At the time of my notes they were facing a large amount of debt coming due in 2024 and a 300 basis point increase on some additional debt due.,2024-09-29
@keylocations What other red flags are you referring to besides the dividend cut?,2024-09-28
@Lord TGO Investment Yes I think it can. I'm watching the cash flow statement to see if this is actually happening.,2024-09-28
"@Lord TGO Investment it is 100% a possibility.  If rates keep trending down, the whole issue holding them back could be a nothing burger.",2024-09-28
This is a stock to be holding long term and not jumping ship not good investment advice,2024-09-27
"@Babinjo I be like ""ha ha ha ha"" and i will add more when it dips back to the upper 50s/low 60s.  it's a cycle",2024-09-27

@Bashar Issa I LOVE the volatility of VST - up over 200% YTD.,2024-09-27
"@GACsafO15 hold, drip into more shares and add more when it dips again.  All a continuous cycle if you are a long term investor.",2024-09-27
@Ron 2023 That’s just it. I thought the price was a great entry for a long term hold. It’s always been at a premium to other Utes. Like all my core dividend growth stocks it’s way up.,2024-09-27
@GACsafO15 Are you an investor or a trader?If you are a trader then you may want to take your profit.I'm an investor and own NEE since 2003.,2024-09-27
"Utes valuation is either in line with their history average or more for alot of them(NEE, DUK, WEC, SO, Etc).  The time to get a ton of margin of safety was the end of 2023/early 2024. Duke at $86/share Oct 2023, WEC at $77/share Oct 2023, SO at $62/share Oct 2023, NEE at $50/share Oct 2023.  I loaded the boat up on NEE and am in at $58/share(up 44%).    I wish I would have added some of the others at the same time but I chose to add some REITs instead due to them being undervalued at the same time.  If those are adding to utes now, you have little room for margin of safety IMO.  Of course 25 years from now this likely doesn't matter whether you buy now or wait to save a few bucks per share assuming financially the company is sound.",2024-09-27
This is a Utility I wanted to own for a long time. Opportunity came last fall & now I’m close to 60% gain. I’m on the fence over whether to sell or not.,2024-09-27
"@gastro4  I prefer traditional utility companies that focus on their regulated business. Duke Energy  (DUK) comes to mind. It has the same Florida exposure, same as NEE, but without unregulated ventures that expose investors to volatile returns and pricing.",2024-09-27
"@Jamjack - lol, I never said otherwise. What a sophomoric response ... it's right up there with ""we need CO2 to live"" or ""climate is cyclical"". No one (certainly not me...) ever said otherwise.Meantime, the reality is that Florida homeowners can't afford home insurance (even if they are lucky enough to find it ..) and beach-houses in North Carolina continue to fall into the ocean:www.youtube.com/...So, you may agree with trump and his non-science backed assertion that global warming is a ""hoax"", but you are paying for it anyway - with your car and home insurance, and indirectly with Federal debt due to massive (off-budget ...) increases in natural disaster ""recovery"" fund:www.cbo.gov/...So you can look in the review mirror at Spanish treasury ships (seriously? lol), but I'm an engineer that prefers to look at modern day science, facts, and statistics. And I have no time for nonsense. MUTE!",2024-09-26
"@Babinjo personal decision.I tend to let my winners run, but if I wanted to raise more cash I wouldn’t mind trimming here. The stock is quite expensive at current levels, but historically this stock is usually expensive.My cost basis is similar to yours, but I wanted a lot more shares than I initially purchased.",2024-09-25
I got in at $55 back in February. Sell or keep?,2024-09-25
"Hi, I do agree that it’s possible that NEP’s dividends could be cut  However, as the Fed continues with cutting interest rates, do you believe that the long-term debt can be safely refinanced and thus dividend could be safe?",2024-09-25
