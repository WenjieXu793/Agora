"I scratch my head about this REIT every time someone writes a BUY piece on it. Looking at the stock performance it appears that smart investors continue to stay away with little change over the last five years despite changes in management, lots of optimism that now's the time etc etc.  Mediocre board, management and and sector that seems to have few real barriers to entry and likely meaningful competition from its customers if they try to push pricing. I've really tried to find a compelling reason to invest in this other than potentially finding a greater fool in the PE sector to take it private. There are just so many better REIT investment opps out there.",2024-08-30
"Very detailed, concise analysis. Thank you. I have been holding (underwater) for some time now, but also believe we’ll see either/or scenario come to pass in the next 12 months.",2024-08-23
Well done.I own some $COLD in my daughter’s account. Fairly priced and on DRIP we are pleased. If the price continues to inexplicably languish then we will endeavor to buy more.Rebuild or takeover candidate either way $COLD future should be better.Thank you for your examination.,2024-08-23
