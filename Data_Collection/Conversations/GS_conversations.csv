"@golfcat1 we ought to control the border, but, we ought to be issuing enough work visas and green cards to offset Boomer retirements. That requires millions of immigrants per year.",2024-10-01
@santlo It won't. Markets will tank if the weird guys take over. They are a threat to democracy and capitalism.,2024-09-30
"@erbrown Don’t bet the farm on that. I don’t see cap gain tax on unrealized gains. For openers, evaluations are impossible, not only for the likes of farm land but also for 1000 shares of a publicly-traded stock, liquidity is a big deal. Then there’s the velue of the local family business. Not so fast.",2024-09-29

"@techy46 Sounds like something a poor person would say, which begs the question why are you even on an investing site to begin with.  Cash has zero risk and earns over 5% which better than most stocks, any one whose not a fool would know that.",2024-09-24

It does seem as if this last proposal was written by the NY Fed. Doesn't look so good on Main Street.,2024-09-20
"Makes sense ... less capital = more odds of failure = more odds of FDIC payouts and capital raises. Of course FDIC would be peeved. Of course, the original Fed proposal was going to immediately put a whole bunch of banks underwater, illustrating just how fragile things are, so they couldn't do it.Stay far away from banking sector. Business risk is high and LT returns on bank stocks are uncompetitive anyway.My two cents. Make if it what you will :)",2024-09-20

"I have switched almost all of my spending to the apple card using apple pay.  It is great to instantly get the 2% cash back deposited in my Apple savings account instead of sitting as ""points"" on a website earning nothing.  I hope the transition to JPM doesn't change too much.  I don't really care about a statement date since I pay it off every 2 weeks anyway.  I do have JPM for my Amazon card, and it has been fine so far.",2024-09-18
