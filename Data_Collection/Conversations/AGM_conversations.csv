"@The Wizard of Duxbury Reef It's interesting that you commented just as I reread a very interesting chapter in the Intelligent Investor, Revised 2003.  Thank you so much for the information.  As with many investors I'm seeking yields and safety. AGM appears to be a very high quality agency stock and really good stock in general.  Currently I have a pile of 17-22 yr Treasury strips, some VGLT, and some LQD.  The purchase rate of the strips is mostly 5.0 - 5.6% but I'm buying above 4.5%.  Strips last week were ~~4.4% max.  It's always refreshing to read the stock bible which reinforces I should not be buying preferreds.  I'm just not knowledgeable or experienced enough.  The strips I understand the full risk and reward.  They are non callable and if things go badly, I know my heirs will have ~5% locked in but they may have to wait 17-22 years.  Patients.  I also understand VGLT is convenient but suffers from the defect of all bond funds. Bond funds do not lock in rates. As rates drop, new investors dilute the rate by forcing the purchase of new lower rate bonds.  As Zweig asks in the intelligent investor revised Ed, chap 20, PG 528,  ""How much experience do I have?"".  Well for me with preferreds I have no deep set knowledge or experience.  According to Graham and Zweig, I'm better off sitting this one out no matter how appealing. Good day",2024-09-28
"@Jeffrey625  Caveat: My $0.02 only and you get what you pay for.       Some plus and minus considerations on AGM preferred, specifically Series D (5.78% coupon) and Series F (5.25% coupon) to be weighed in accordance with what your personal objective is for this portion of your portfolio and what your anxieties/concerns are.   (1) Callability - Both D&F are callable at any time.  Obviously D is most likely to be called before F (Series A was called in Sept 2020 with a 5.875% coupon at a time when AGM could have called D or F as well.  Obviously it would have been dumb to call a series with a lower coupon first.)  A call becomes increasingly likely as the spread between the coupon rate and the Fed rate increases.  Note: neither D nor F was called when the Fed rate was about 0.  If the preferred is called and a new (replacement) series issued at a lower coupon rate, that would likely increase the earning available for common dividends (depends on the relative size of the replacement series and the replaced series, how effectively any increase in principal amount is invested by AGM, etc).     (2) Noncumulative - Both D&F are noncumulative.  I believe that it is a very unlikely event given the very solid - indeed outstanding - performance of AGM's portfolio even through the worse of times.  Given AGM's strong financials if the Directors decide to not pay dividends on the preferred then probably something nasty has hit the fan in the economy generally or a significant part of AGM's rural utility loan portfolio has had catastrophic losses due to something like utility-caused wildfires.  (3) Income Tax Rate On Dividends paid by this preferred security are eligible for the preferential income tax rate of 15% to a maximum of 20% depending on the holder's tax bracket (and under IRS specified holding restrictions) and are also eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate holders.  See  www.quantumonline.com/...  an excellent site for research on preferreds if you have not found it already.  This renders AGM preferred an attractive position for in anyone's taxable account.     (4) Conclusion: To buy or not buy now?  Obviously, this depends on where you see the Fed's rate going (i.e. do you think that inflation is tamed; that proposed high trade tariffs and income tax cuts primarily benefiting ___?____, or the alternative policies will inflame inflation or result in greater unemployment; etc).  At the time of my writing this I have seen very credible projections of the Fed rate going to 3.3% by the end of 2025 and that is my personal feeling about where we are most likely to go.  That means an appreciation on the AGM preferred plus enjoyment of your yield at purchase price.  Market has been slow to act in anticipation of the Sept 2024 Fed rate cut so you would still be ahead of the crowd by buying in now if you see the future Fed Rate being cut further.  Good luck.",2024-09-28
"@Delta Dividends Understand the hesitancy to pull the trigger. I’m doing it a few shares at a time, as dividends from other holdings come in, so maybe I’ll catch some lower prices, maybe some higher prices. Doing the same as I’m accumulating AGM and D. This approach has served me well over time.",2024-09-27

"@Florida Doug13 It typically trades with the bank stocks, which haven't done well either.  No more updates from me; I've retired from Seeking Alpha.  But I will say that I expect to hold a large position in this stock pretty much forever.",2024-09-27
"Started building a position in AGM just a few months ago, for many of the same reasons brought out by the author. I’m sure hoping the price will continue to languish at or below current levels long enough for me to build a consequential position.  If the company continues a similar trend in the dividend growth in the future I’ll be a happy happy happy man.",2024-09-26
I dont know why there are so few people talking about this stock. Crushed the S&P 500 over 10 years and seems like a pretty safe bet,2024-09-26
