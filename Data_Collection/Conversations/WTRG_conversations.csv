"@Kody's Dividends The expression core competences only appears when companies start selling off poor performing assets.It's an alternate spelling for oops.I remember when this stock sent out quarterly newsletters to stock holders by U.S. mail announcing the latest M&A with performance results.The former CEO was a great guy.Now it's just another ticker on a list of other tickers to consider.The nat gas acquisition has slowed most of the growth worth discussing.The 3.4% dividend could be it's only bright point.The other water utes don't come near that.A solution here would be if another larger ute bought them out or at least the nat gas side.FTC, EMRAF, NI, PPL, maybe DUK look in your pockets for loose change and end this. Where is ENB when you need them? They like nat gas utes in the USA.There is always some private hedge funders or an activist thug that could appear and weasel it's disassembly one profit center at a time leaving less earnings. That ripe dividend merely a future accounting adjustment.",2024-09-20
@Kody's Dividends Don't mind cash at 4-5%. So far sale proceeds invested in adding more UTG and SCHD. Have an open buy order to begin a SCHY position.,2024-09-20
@usiah Any ideas on substitutes yet? Or going to sit on the cash a while?,2024-09-20
@rhythmbreakdown2 once aquaman left as ceo the company has gone nowhere. I really thought they would by York,2024-09-20
"@usiah I don't blame you. I'm about even in the three years I've owned it, including dividends. The sentiment just refuses to budge, though.",2024-09-19
After several years underwater with no upward progress I'm starting to contemplate selling.Retired income/dividend-growth investor (very long other utilities),2024-09-19
Big mistake acquiring a natural gas company. The should have stuck with their history of acquiring water companies.,2024-09-19
"@w00t Yes. Utilities are usually free cash flow negative. This would be a problem for most businesses, but isn't for utilities due to their business models. They rely on share issuances and debt issuances to fund growth. That's why they're so well represented among the Dividend Kings and Dividend Aristocrats.",2024-09-16
"@Liquidity Swords That's spelledA-I (space)B-U-B-B-L-EThis years joy, next year some other bigger and better toys.When it finally dawns on investors how long it takes to build a power plant from scratch to turbines spinning, there will be a vacuum sound coming from the CFOs office of many utilities. Average is 7-10yrs to completion.Next year's fad, vacuum cleaners.Get one strong enough to pick up your loose change.Who is willing to pay for all these power plants?They've been telling you to conserve energy. So now you should pay more for their use?",2024-09-16
"Owned this thing since 2000. I have a large cg with at the times plits and stock divs, and it has been DOA since the purchase of the gas thing in 2019. BIG mistake!!! Likely it will not go up until the gas part gets a tail wind. I am stuck and will not add.",2024-09-16
This one has now nearly 50% Natural Gas Business. Probably also the reason why the Stock did so poorly. Water and Gas is a strange combination adding volatility that I would not want to own.,2024-09-16
@Jeffrey625 AI story. Expectations of increased demand from hyperscalers making long term deals for electricity for data centers.,2024-09-15
It's unclear to me why the electric utilities are mostly going through the roof while the water utilities with apparently similar dividends are flat?  It's good for new buyers but unclear why.,2024-09-15
Holder of the stock but no plans to add more currently. Wake me up if it goes sub $30/share. Otherwise I am leaving this position be.,2024-09-15
Their Peoples Gas segment should look for a joint venture with a data center to stabilize earnings. Develop a nat gas fired turbine power plant co-owned with a data center to reduce competition with neighboring electric utes.Big advantage their Aqua side could provide needed cooling water too.,2024-09-15
Do they pay dividends out of EPS? I know nothing about HÂ²O companies. Usually it's FCF - but you mentioned a percentage of EPS.,2024-09-15
"Okey dokey, Kody!I'm not particularly fond of regulated utilities, but water is certainly a precious commodity and WTRG and AWR are both reasonable choices in this space. They are appealing even if not compelling investment choices for me.",2024-09-15
