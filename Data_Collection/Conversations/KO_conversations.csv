"The purchase of the rest of CELH would seem like a good idea here.  Think about this.  CELH currently has a market cap of $7B.  PEP owns 8.5% of the company, so they would need $6.5B to buy the rest.  Lets say PEP gives CELH a premium to close the deal, so maybe it costs $7.5B -$8.5B, but they would then control a good brand in a rapidly growing market.",2024-10-05
"I do not doubt the brand power of Frito-Lay.  Here in the Northwest, they dominate the shelves and usually have end caps and free-standing displays.  It may be different in other parts of the country, but the Pepsi beverage section is playing a sleepy third place role to Coke and Keurig/DP.  ""Starry"" - the brilliant (?) new introduction to replace Sierra Mist, is rarely available though sometimes in the small-sized cans.  There are many different versions of Mountain Dew, mostly unmemorable.  This is a rare week for Pepsi where the best deals on soda are exclusively theirs.  You would hardly know it from the shopper's carts where they stick to favored non-Pepsi offerings.I'm not investing in the sector at all right now but have been considering one of the Mexican Coke franchises (FMX or KOF).  The weakness in PEP has made me wonder what would happen if DP ditched RC and actually tried to build a popular cola brand.  That would be interesting in this otherwise sleepy sector.",2024-10-05
"Good time to Nibble on a Blue Chip Dividend King.  PepsiCo's history: PepsiCo has increased its dividend for 52 years in a row.  It's the GOAT in ""Snacks & Soda"".",2024-10-05

"@Bernard Zambonin Very fair points. Yes, KO is expensive now, and if I were considering it for my portfolio, I'd likely wait for the consumer packaged goods stocks to be hit on a bad day or bad interval. On the larger issue of allocation, over about five decades I've found it best to keep enough cash and short-term high-quality fixed income for possible immediate needs and periods of volatile or depressed equity markets, preferring T-Bills to longer-term debt. I prefer the risk in a diversified equity portfolio than credit and market risks on debt. A few of my equity positions now provide an annual dividend equal to the cost-basis of the shares.",2024-09-30
Loving KO and dripping those ever increasing dividends. This was such a great deal below $60.. not all that long ago!,2024-09-30
"""Valuation make it a hold""Kind of a theme these days.  At Cape 36+ it will likely be very difficult to find quality stocks that are not selling at near record long term valuations.  My list is full of quality and defensive stocks that have long since lost their margin of error. Cape indicates why. Simply print out a Cape 25 or 50 year chart which is highly dependent on tech stocks.  Then from the bottom set a piece of paper on the Cape 25 line.  That's troubling.  Now move the cover sheet up to the Cape 35 line.  That's really scary. Now move the cover sheet to Cape 45.  Even the extraordinary valuations of 100%+ avg annual returns of 1995-2000 tech bubble of Cape 44 disappear. When you're standing on the tracks and the train runs you over, don't complain there was no warning. Even defensive stocks like Coke have lost their defensive aspect.",2024-09-30
"@Sugar Charlie It’s a good question, and the answer depends largely on your strategy. In my view, bonds are a completely different type of investment. Allocating capital to a bond instead of KO means trading potential upside for near-zero downside risk—something you can't achieve with stocks, even dividend payers.Stock returns, whether or not they include dividends, are heavily influenced by valuations. There’s a big difference between a dividend-paying stock that consistently yields below or near treasury rates and is undervalued, versus one that’s expensive—such as KO now.",2024-09-30
"Long KO with a cost basis about $11.35. Long-term investors like me are usually locked-in because after-tax proceeds of disposition would not normally permit purchase of a superior position in some other asset. But for others, a reasonable question is: In the context of your whole portfolio, your time-horizon, and your possible  cash needs, and taking tax into account, are you better with a position in KO with current and longer-term dividend payments than with a bond?",2024-09-29
Going with the quality international licensees instead of the US company.,2024-09-29
@REITer's Digest True.. as an owner I just want continuing rising dividends and a little capital appreciation!,2024-09-29
I believe they have some money set aside for this lawsuit?,2024-09-29

I think I'd rather buy a great company at a bad price then a bad company at a great price.,2024-09-27
"Solid management on dividend king KO, keep compounding the dividends.",2024-09-27
"You just made the case to own ko. Pepsi is only being held up by the snacks division which sells over priced junk. Doritos are loaded with msg, carcinogens and 2 dyes which are bad for you",2024-09-27
Bought this company when the stock recently went into the 50s. Very glad I did. Steady company. Raise dividend each year witch just raises the floor each year.,2024-09-27
KO is one that I watched for years and years.. last year when it was yielding close to 4% was lucky enough to get a bunch of it.. now going to settle in for the next few decades.. collect rising dividends and buy on dips! I do appreciate your update. I didn’t realize the growth has been so good the last 5 years.. and the return.,2024-09-27
I'm 30% up and dividends are safe. Why would I sell?,2024-09-27
"They stopped bottling/packaging it, but are they discontinuing it as a flavor in their Coke-Freestyle-Dispensing machines?  I thoroughly enjoy the selectivity and choice in the restaurant setting.",2024-09-24
