"@dxamond appreciate your commentary.  If you look at the paragraph on Valuation, I cite as data sources the forward P/E multiples as well as analyst consensus EPS estimates for two different fiscal years, so as to compare the peer average multiples against future EPS estimates of this stock.  All forward P/E ratios are from Seeking Alpha and or ycharts.",2024-10-08 11:39:23.944761
"I agree with the first comment, this was a well-written article. I am curious, however, where do you find metrics for giving your own score to a company, based on its fundamentals alone? I have read price targets from BofA global research, Morningstar, and CFRA and have made decisions somewhat based on these metrics. Mostly curious on how you could determine an undervaluation of $21.91.",2024-10-08 11:39:23.944761

"@David Zanoni re ""Plus, the overall global aluminum market is expected to grow at 6% annually over the same period. Much of that is coming from transportation and construction.""Very interesting report and analysis on Alcoa. Thanks! However, regarding aluminum demand as with the above commenter I'm not so sure that aluminum is going to be the go to metal because it seems that lightweight, high strength steel might be the better cost to weight ratio value, at least when it comes to exterior panels, and increasingly for EV body structure.That said, if giga casting continues to take over the industry and remains using aluminum, then maybe aluminum could start dominating automotive demand.bisresearch.com/...The automotive gigacasting market was valued at $71.6 million in 2023, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 47.88% and reach $3,579.6 million by 2033. The market is at a nascent stage and is projected to experience steady growth. Market players investing in research, infrastructure, and partnerships are expected to capitalize on the increasing demand for the automotive gigacasting industry.  Yet, what is steel alloys take that over too?www.sae.org/...“Today, many automakers are talking about high-pressure die-cast aluminum, especially for BEVs,” Brad Davey, executive VP at steel giant ArcelorMittal said. Speaking with SAE Media following his keynote address at the recent 2024 Great Designs in Steel (GDIS) conference in Novi, Michigan, Davey acknowledged that giant HPDC aluminum ‘gigacastings lend themselves to ‘skateboard ’EV platforms due to their potential to consolidate parts and simplify manufacturing. The end benefit, he said,“ is capital-expense assembly line savings,” particularly for EV companies.“If you can reduce floor space and the number of welding robots in assembly, by using one large casting, it can be an attractive solution – compared with traditional processes, that is,” he said....Even after losing Ford’s F-Series to the light metal in 2012, steel today still makes up over 50% of an average vehicle’s mass. At GDIS, American Iron and Steel Institute CEO Kevin Dempsey noted that 75% of modern steel alloys have been developed in the last 20 years; more than 3,500 steel grades are available today....Steel industry analyses reveal that nine of the top 10 vehicles with the highest utilization of high-strength steel are EVs, Davey said. He added that the adoption rate of laser-welded, press-hardened steels is running 50% higher in EVs than in hybrid and ICE vehicles.“We’re winning back the battery boxes,” he said. “Nearly every automaker is in discussion with us and others about how to utilize steel in battery structures. One North American OEM has told us their future for battery boxes is 100% steel, or highly steel-intensive.”Bring on the competition, Davey said, echoing his industry colleagues at GDIS. “The competition is good for all of us.” His keynote concluded with a warning: “China is adopting these steel solutions at about two times the rate of the Western world.”",2024-09-27 00:00:00.000000
"@LenceFlatu The use of aluminum in beverage cans has been increasing  with the benefit of having a high recycling rate. Brands such as Celsius, Starbucks, Monster, numerous alcohol brands, Simply, Day One, etc. have beverages in aluminum cans.  The global market for aluminum cans is expected to grow at 3% annually to 2032. Plus, the overall global aluminum market is expected to grow at 6% annually over the same period. Much of that is coming from transportation and construction.",2024-09-23 00:00:00.000000
"Again looking forward to going back to being crazy bullish on the US equity market after the coming election has passed and the United States simply ends its nuclear Navy once and for all maybe keep the Carrier Enterprise under construction but cannot see much of a need for boomer subs anymore in an era when Russia simply ceases to exist as appears imminent now so no not constructive on metals, lumber, oil, natural gas certainly not aluminum at the moment as the massive natural gas in the USA continues to pour forth crazy advanced thermoplastics for use in keeping food and drink properly stored and potable. Ukraine Air Force has no need for even powered manned aircraft capable of using gliders to begin a bombing Campaign against Russia that would be far more devastating than anything that happened in World War 2 in that sense so no don't expect the US aerospace industry to suddenly become a massive consumer of aluminum either #autoclave as the entire commercial aviation Industry moves to adopt the Boeing 787 for obvious reasons of course. Deminimus use of aluminum in the US automotive industry although that could change given the Tesla Cybertruck and need to reduce weight. Building boom is now building Bust in the USA for many Years now short gold strong sell as well",2024-09-22 00:00:00.000000
