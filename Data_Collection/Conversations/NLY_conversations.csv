The yield curve is no longer inverted and as the fed keeps reducing rates the curve will steepen more,2024-10-06
Its not a bad stock but not exciting at this price.  MITT is similar perhaps a bit better investment.,2024-10-05
@Valenciana EmailMe at flipper2058@yahoo and I can show my spread sheets on their debt stack if you’d like.,2024-10-04
@flipper58 Thanks for thoughts.  I have added the tickers into my watch list. I'm currently traveling but i intend to dig into it  further when I can park in one spot for awhile. I was involved for quite awhile in WBD after the spinout. Not profitably. Another leveraged Malone transition play.  Originally I thought it was simply an operational restructuring story from the bad ATT management of the business. The new team did a great job on that front: dramatically improving fcf. Unfortunately the point I missed was just how radically the content distribution ecosystem has changed.  The legacy side  melted much quicker than expected. Market fragmentation is huge and its difficult to aggregate the eyeballs like before. They have not been able to arrest the Ebidta decline.I still actively monitor WBD because I do think a lot of the past three years of efforts might bear fruit in the upcoming quarters. In that case the equity value could fly. This Qvcc situation seems to have a lot of similarities. I also like that it might be profitably played from a secured debt position,2024-10-04
"@Valenciana I won’t say I have any wisdom on their ability to stabilize sales. I do feel the marketing plan makes sense vs going off track too much. The story attracted me on Malone and Maffei involvement. I trust they know what to do, if there’s anything.  The approach I took , barbell, relates to safe return/ high return combo. No idea why QRTEA flying today. But I expect to have my shares years, the leverage is immense.",2024-10-04
"@flipper58 just finished reading up your comments on qvcc and the article to which it was attached.  After hearing from you, I decided to see what was holding your interest these days. It seems quite interesting and one worth digging into. I think will do so.   The one overarching issue I want further clarity on is Qurate's ability to successfully transition its channels into streaming.  I always think of those channels as legacy bundle content.   The ability to sustain or regrow their business would seem to depend upon getting into the new distribution channels.  Where they're positioned on that would factor into what EV/EBITDA multiple they deserve. Any thoughts on that front? I see you used a 5x in your comments.  Not too demanding on the surface but with the likes of WBD around 6x, it might be rich.   From reading that article he focused on Qurate as a retail name but it also seems to part legacy media content producer.",2024-10-04
"@Valenciana Nice to hear from you. I am ok with a portion playing the MREITs but mostly I am in high grade preferreds, I love 1940 act ones. I always spice it up with speculative debt in hopes I get it right and they stick. For now I am outsizing qvcc/d. Take a look. It’s complex, you will like that ;-))",2024-10-04
"@flipper58 @flipper58 hey flipper haven't spoken with you much since the legacy reserves days. Hope all is well. Fair points.  The mreit asset class just doesn't appeal to me as a way to play rates. There are so many other better ways to take rate views. With straight treasuries, for example, you'd get the same falling repo rate benefits without the negative convexity issue. They also can be leveraged higher as the repo haircuts are lower.  (I  was a repo trader for four years in my early days)",2024-10-04
@Valenciana But you can’t not include the cost of Repos typically plummets faster than the negative convextity. Floating rate REITs experience far greater issues with run off in lowering rates. With lowering rates they also can relever the portfolio to make up for high run off rates. Nly typically holds term hedges.,2024-10-04
"Will the Fed head its way back to ZIRP?  We know World Central Banks loved it and is really the only way to absorb giant deficits via the positive carry it creates. Govt can’t afford deflation. Unlike many banks NLY knows how to run a balance sheet. With the yield curve inverted and long rates exploding NLY sold a huge pile of stock to shore up its balance sheet. Painful but needed vs evaporate like many banks. 1/2 point cut on borrowing costs is well over $300m positive in costs cut. Not to mention the cost of hedges forward can drop significantly. Their ability to have enough net cash flow to support that dividend has gotten better. I don’t really care about appreciation, but as the dividend gets supported stronger the 13% yield ( earned) will get better noticed. I’ve owned NLY-G for a few years, but am now buying the common too.",2024-10-04
@ghostdog1121 Why haven’t those been called?  Looks like they have 3 issuances that are floating at high rates.  Maybe that’s what they would have to pay on new issue preferreds so it isn’t worth it?,2024-10-02
why buy NLY when NLY-I has a 10.5% yield?   With strong coverage.  Much safer for only a small yield sacrifice,2024-10-02
@PendragonY lol. I sincerely wish you luck if you buy and hold NLY.,2024-09-26
"@kurth83 That article entirely misses the cyclic nature of NLY's profits, share price and dividends.",2024-09-26
"@PennyPlanSupporter You mistake a temporary drop in market price for a change in value. I am not selling but buying, so lower prices represent an opportunity.",2024-09-26
"@PennyPlanSupporter Well, over the last 2 years, an investment that cost me $20K has produced about $3700 in cash.",2024-09-25
"@Ljsavarese157 Not only will MSR values decline, but  as mortgage prepayments rise,  the replacement MBS investments coupons will decline.",2024-09-24
"@OffSiteLocation Even lenders to NLY in the repo market are compensated for credit risk.  It’s not huge.  Less than a hundred basis points, but your point is correct: people shouldn’t get the impression the company has zero risk. FWIW I don’t think the article said the company itself is riskless.  It seemed pretty clear that it meant the agency MBS is credit riskless, but clarification is always good! ",2024-09-24
"@Rida Morwa ”The result is an investment that carries near zero credit risk”This leaves your readers with an impression that this reit has near zero risk.  The underlying mbs has very low risk, but the reit itself has much risk due to the leverage employed and dangers with term and rate movements.",2024-09-24
@PennyPlanSupporter I have gotten far more than a moderate reward for owning the stock. And I expect that to continue or improve.,2024-09-24
