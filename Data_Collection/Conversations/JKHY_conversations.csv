"Somewhat separate from my previous post today, a conservative trade on JKHY's sideways trend--and low likelihood of falling--is writing puts. Of course, this has risks.",2024-08-30
"JKHY interests me because Stansberry Research rated it exceptionally well run, in the upper 1% of companies, with exceptional strength in ""capital efficiency"" and ""finances."" They selected it for Stansberry's Quant Portfolio, analogous to SA's ""Alpha Picks.""   These ratings are not consistent with SA's data and ratings, and Stansberry's ratings rarely are--but they still suggest potential. Your essay above is not internally consistent. You wrote ""When I write a company a 'hold', it's my statement that shares are likely to perform along the lines of the broader market for the foreseeable future. However, Jack Henry & Associates has fallen short of those expectations."" Indeed, over the past 1 year and 3 years JKHY has fallen very short of the S&P500, as I see with SA charting. For almost a year it has gone sideways while S&P rose dramatically. For consistency you are projecting either that JKHY will rise to catch up to S&P or it will now start keeping up, or implying it should be rated below ""hold,"" i.e., ""sell.""  My own perspective is that banks are now doing great, so JKHY should now start to do great instead of going sideways.  Simple, but let's not overthink it.",2024-08-30
"Why would anyone own JKHY stock? The SA Quant is a 2.93 hold. It's forward PE is 28.52. It's way too expensive with a Valuation of F. It's dividend is only 1.34%, there are far better dividend stocks. I only looked at your article because I used to work at a bank before I retired.",2024-08-25
Good info and the peer comparison list was helpful in understanding their sector and competition. I don't own directly but JKHY is held in my NFJ fund.,2024-08-23
