@Kirk Spano In order to get back to better there may be some resistance but that bit of resistance is far better for the future than the destruction we are seeing now.,2024-10-02
@boris gudonov Every one of these investment firms have a list. Maybe they're pitching their book. They want you to buy the price up! ;-),2024-10-02
"@golfcat1 we ought to control the border, but, we ought to be issuing enough work visas and green cards to offset Boomer retirements. That requires millions of immigrants per year.",2024-10-01
"@kalu0003 BX, but it would have to be a significant pull back. My mother-in-law and 4 granddaughters have all owned BX since it traded under $30.",2024-09-30
"@kalu0003 Oh. I would compare OWL, which is an asset manager, to the likes of BLK, ARES or KKR rather than to OBDC, which is a BDC. I prefer any of the others to OWL.",2024-09-30
@ndardick I am referring stock ticker OWL and not OBDC. Thanks,2024-09-30
@santlo It won't. Markets will tank if the weird guys take over. They are a threat to democracy and capitalism.,2024-09-30
@Rhoda711 Axel Springer yes. Is there something particularly interesting about the deal?,2024-09-29
"@kalu0003 If by OWL you are referring to OBDC (known as Blue Owl), I do like that BDC second amongst the largest 4 BDCs by market cap, but I prefer FSK which trades at a greater discount to NAV (17%) than OBDC (2%). There are other reasons, such as the fact that FSK has a much higher yield than OBDC. For lots of useful information, take a look at the following website:https://cefdata.com/bdc/The other two largest BDCs are ARCC and BXSL.",2024-09-29
"@ndardick Just to get your personal perspective: as a long term investment, which one do you like better: FSK vs OWL? Thanks in advance for your personal views on this issue.",2024-09-29
"@Leo Nelissen On a market pull back, where would you PERSONALLY put new money  among these (( if given only two choices): KKR, ARES, APO, OWL, BX?  Thanks in advance.",2024-09-29
"@erbrown Don’t bet the farm on that. I don’t see cap gain tax on unrealized gains. For openers, evaluations are impossible, not only for the likes of farm land but also for 1000 shares of a publicly-traded stock, liquidity is a big deal. Then there’s the velue of the local family business. Not so fast.",2024-09-29
Stock Market at record levels under Biden-Harris …why will change  to Trump be better for market?,2024-09-29
@slodon28 of course it will - just ask Milton Friedman. Spending leads to inflation (Why I sold any bond holding/ blended fund before 2022). Don't make this so hard.,2024-09-16
@TJ Burke Wont all of that NEW that government spending increase inflation?,2024-09-16
Spending will take off again under Harris. All her initiatives require new spending. It's objective reality and your lack of policy awareness or shallow partisanship does not change it.,2024-09-15
Communism or Capitalism. Hmmm Wonder which will be good for the stock market?,2024-09-15
@quicktwo9 Is this the KKR involved in a split up?Thank you,2024-09-14
It would be nice al least to know the reasoning behing certain picks.,2024-09-13
