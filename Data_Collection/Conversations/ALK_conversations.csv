Excellent article/ bought the small dip from past two days/ has always been my preferred airline stock,2024-10-03
"@cantpickawinner A couple of years ago I trimmed at 50 and 55, waiting for 60+ to really unload. The last never came. So I replaced my shares in the 30s and plan to repeat my 50-55-60+ strategy if given the opportunity.",2024-09-26
"Pre covid Alaska Air was running arouond a $60 stock price.Today it is just over $40, but EPS is at pre covid levels.  Markets just putting a lower PE on the stock now than back then.  Will Mr. Market start giving ALK a higher PE ratio in the future?",2024-09-26
"There is a lot of power behind ALK's share price lately, which I think is the voting, not the weighing. I have a large ALK position and am happy for the price appreciation, but the long-run value will depend on the route connection and cost synergies, which don't always happen. $51 is not that high a value though. Thanks for the article.",2024-09-26
@BLyda97112 thanks for reading and commenting.I too believe that ALK will open many new opportunities via the Hawaiian merger.,2024-09-19
"Excellent article, Tim.  Looking forward to the post-merger Alaskan Airlines and hopefully it will get above $50 in the near future.  I have no idea if it will ever get back into the $70s, but that would not break my heart.",2024-09-19
"@OverTheHorizon ""In play"" means it is possible.Definitely, but don't expect any real premium over market cap. While no bankruptcy in near term, management has to consider that  best action on behalf of the shareholders which is preservation of their capital in a merger. Of course, Spirit management knows more about passenger trends than we know here.If true, JBLU or ULCC likelies, but ALGT or Breeze possible..",2024-09-18
"@astute pathways Assets need to be supported with other infrastructure. Merely buying the planes in bankruptcy, loses the rest of the infrastructure costs like offices, gates, employees and maintenance facilities, call centers, etc.  Then you would lose the frequent flyer program, with an off balance sheet value in the billions.Buying a running entity has greater value than buying the pieces separately.  Mergers are based on synergies. Cost savings from consolidation and duplication typically drive mergers.  I am sure Alaska has calculated all that before proposing the merger.",2024-09-18
@AirJer33 That merger was shut down in its current form where jetBlue was to convert Spirit planes to higher cost JetBlue configuration. But a refiling may have different outcomes.,2024-09-17
So they let this go through but not the JBLU and SAVE merger? Someone must have done some (good) hand greasing...,2024-09-17
"@astute pathways Assets, like planes, are impossible to get and would have sold at a giant premium in a plane market with strikes and supplier issues.",2024-09-17
"HA was near BK...It would have been cheaper to let them go out of business,and bid on their assets. All this without adding HA huge debt.",2024-09-17
The little ponyâ€™s are gaining ground down the backstretch. Buy $JBLU $ULCC $MESA and long shot $SAVE.,2024-09-12
