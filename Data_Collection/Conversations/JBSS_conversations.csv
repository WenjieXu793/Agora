"I first bought into JBSS below $20. The X-factor here is management. They are 2nd and 3rd generation of the original founder and they know the nut business inside and out. Add in a very savvy business sense and they can flat out make money. Once inflation subsides, JBSS will rise again IMO.",2024-10-05
