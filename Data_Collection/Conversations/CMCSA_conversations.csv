"@El Financeiro I agree. So Disney GoG is James Gun universe extension. Now is James Gun leader of DC studios(which did not exists before WBD merge). So he will continue with Peacemaker 2 and have there more projects like Creature Comandos, Authority, Waller, Paradise Lost, Lanterns. So I believe he will bring great characters, originality and logic into DCPenguin is more like great writing, acting ala HBO Sopranos where you even don't care about DC.",2024-10-06
"@Torakichi I haven’t seen Penguin.. but it’s one I’m considering.   Unlike DC, Marvel has been able to thrive by “introducing” new characters to the mass market.  Like Guardians of the Galaxy, Ms Marvel, Iron Man, Black Panther, etc.  these were ‘B’ characters in the marvel universe.  DC regurgitates Batman and Batman characters over and over and over.  There’s only so many resets / reintroduction of Joker, Penguin, etc.    look at peacemaker that is new and unique for DC.",2024-10-06
@Herbert +H-Dog+ Kornfeld  Why did FEMA spend all its money on illegals and nothing left for hurricane victims?,2024-10-06
@El Financeiro Like current most popular TV show Penguin? Which is under DC studios logo. Joker 2 is 'elseworld' and really bad call from management to give too much freedom and money for this project.,2024-10-06
"@SeriousUsername No it does not perform well and will not perform well. Definitelly bomb, probably hard to achieve even 300M WW. But comparing to Sony's Concord, what budget are you using for Concord?",2024-10-06
These Batman reset have got to stop .  DC can try to introduce one of thousands of characters that may be lesser known but can be compelling.,2024-10-06
"What a misleading headline, insinuating this film is doing well for WarnerBrothers.It costs 10x as much as the first joker and so far made a tenth of the first jokers in sales.This thing will barely lose WB less than sony lost on concord and even that only based on hate-watchers.",2024-10-06

I love articles like this.  It reinforces the negative view of comcasts business model. I am happy to share a different view.  Comcast has pricing power in many markets as well as a cost advantages...(upload speed are not important to many consumers)...fixed wireless can not compete mid and long term due to capacity constraints. Comcast has a successful growth engine in mobile.  obviously I am long. Pleased to hear counter points to my view?,2024-09-27
@Gytis Zizys do they even have a plan to make up from the loss of cord cutters?,2024-09-26
"@enron-hubbard I think you are correct on the convergence play, as everyone is now doing it. It’s pretty clear.  I think you should investigate who has the cost advantage - it’s cable by quite a bit. As for profitability, charter has started to do it and said that on a stand alone basis mobileMakes money. What that usually means is on the incremental additional line, most of it will drop to the bottom line. Comcast has been more opaque but their economics will be similar. The name of the game is going to be consolidation - fiber to the telcos and the cable cos either building or buying smaller operators. Ultimately, the question is will the business just be worse for everyone ? But cable is where my money is for the lions share of the profits.",2024-09-24
"@Pablo Linguist  << my comment was specifically about ATT - they are treading water in internet by losing dsl at the same rate as fiber gain. >>That's not the case. Like the other ILECs, the same dynamic is at work for T in that their historical DSL penetration was very low (~10-12%) and now Consumer broadband is growing total Revenue and EBITDA at a healthy clip through fiber growth. That growth is stated net of the declines in voice and DSL revenues. Take a look at the numbers, it's hard to conclude otherwise.Who would I rather be? Over the past three years I was better off hedged to cable with an investment in FYBR. But now that's been snatched away from me.  Looking forward, I think that CMCSA's mobile penetration of existing broadband customers (12%?) has a lot of room to grow, but, as we've discussed before, I'm still unsure how profitable that growth will be. At some point they will split those results out and we will see.Meanwhile, what I am comfortable with is concluding that the FTTH market will consolidate, and the big 3 mobile companies will be the consolidators. We already see that happening. Then most everyone will be pitching a converged service package.",2024-09-24
@The Masked Superstar confidently incorrect.About 90% of all traffic goes through spectrums own network and not Verizon.  They already make money on mobile and will only make more as they now have scale.,2024-09-24
"@enron-hubbard my comment was specifically about ATT - they are treading water in internet by losing dsl at the same rate as fiber gain.As for is fiber a competitor of cable- yes it is. Is it an existential threat- no. Fiber is about 45% over built to cable right now and will be 60% in about 6 years. Meanwhile, cable is adding millions of mobile lines each year and is flattish in internet. Who would you rather be",2024-09-24
"@nerd_rage  I also dropped Comcast and the cable bundle about 15 years ago, and converted to DSL.  Don’t miss cable.Recently switched from DSL to Verizon 5G Home wireless, getting 15x the speed for 2/3 the cost.  A small fiber company is laying fiber in my neighborhood right now, offering 1, 5, and 8 Gb service.  A couple of years ago Comcast was the only option to get faster than DSL, but not today.It’s interesting to consider what it would take for Comcast to change their customer service reputation to best in class.  I suspect it’s nearly impossible.",2024-09-24
"@papaale CMCSA's terrible customer service should have been part of this article because as competition ramps up for connectivity, it's going to kill them if they don't do something immediately to improve it by a lot.Here's my little story about CMCSA. They tried jacking up my price (internet only) by about 50%. I contacted their customer service (via chat, not touching the phone) and threatened to switch to T-Mobile. The rep dutifully read their script and told me T-Mobile speed sucks. I said I don't care, match their price or I'm gone. They matched T-Mobile's price. The kicker is, I can't even get T-Mobile at my address but some CS rep in Mumbai doesn't know that. This is just shows what a bad customer service experience CMCSA offers and how ineffective it is anyway. You can google around and find strategies for getting what you want out of them, so it's not like they're bilking anyone but the most elderly and ignorant of the customers. Whenever I see some old person on Nextdoor complaining about CMCSA jacking up their rates, I coach them on how to deal with that.CMCSA should not require customers to call or chat to do what they need to do. A good modern customer service experience means self service on a website or app. I churn around several streaming services, for example. I subscribe and cancel via their website or app. There's no reason for me to talk with anyone at NFLX, DIS, AAPL etc. They've got their services designed correctly.",2024-09-24
"@Buyandhold 2012 I dumped CMCSA 12 years ago in favor of just getting an ISP and NFLX.I've since dumped NFLX and just churn around the competition. This is standard behavior for millions of people. My total internet and entertainment budget is around $75/month and I get a far more expanded range of content than cable/broadcast ever offered, ad-free.CMCSA has already lost the battle in content. The only way they're going to survive the emerging competition in connectivity is if they vastly improve their customer relationships but I haven't seen much evidence of that happening.If you like PBS, you should check out Kanopy and Hoopla (free/ad-free streaming platforms provided by libraries).",2024-09-24
"Good writeup. In content, broadcast/cable is done and streaming success is mandatory as at least a partial replacement (as DIS, WBD and PARA are finding). CMCSA is so far behind with Peacock that they should give up and switch to a Sony type arms dealer strategy.In connectivity, any competition will hit CMCSA harder than it should because in order to hang onto customers when competition emerges, CMCSA need to have excellent customer relationships. Instead, they've jerked customers around so much that their customer service rep is a joke.Both areas are under attack. What are they doing to address this?",2024-09-24
