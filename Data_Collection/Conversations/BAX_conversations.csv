@The Dividend Bro Poor management results in surprises... the bad kind. I have been down that road with Pfizer before.,2024-08-31
"Guess I’m the only one owning this lol.I’ve bought this year in the $34-35 range. Went too big so halved my position on this latest run. Odd how the market didn’t like the sale but soon enough it recovered. Sometimes wonder if a game is being played and I don’t realize I’m the sucker at the table.Seriously, I think this will go down again with the dividend cut. There is the potential to make a nice profit on this but the company needs to execute. Enough investors doubt their ability hence the current price.",2024-08-31
