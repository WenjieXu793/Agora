@SummitWaldo56 the sole and only difference is the class B votes and the RDI is a non-voting class. The RDIB is extremely illiquid and low public float as  The cotter sisters control 70% of the RDIB (they have greater economic ownership - albeit mostly inherited or granted as prior exec comp) in Reading via the RDI non voting shares) This is why when reading has been in the ru2000 and presently is in ru microcap index it is the RDI shares that are in the index. Note also for unexplained reasons (used to be there was a change of control play when Sr was alive and passed and their was the Trust and  estate litigation) mark cuban continues to own another 12% and gabelli a bit over 5% of the RDIB so of the 1.68MM shares of RDIB 13% of the class might be in traders hands.,2024-09-26
@Andrew Shapiro  I see RDIB shares hit a new low today. What are the differences in the class of shares? Can you point me to a resource that explains it?  TIA,2024-09-25
"@howrcfa Respectfully 18-months ago was March of 2023 when the industry was on its original rebound from the Pandemic - and before the screenwriter's union and then actors union embarked on 9 months of their own strike which further damaged and delayed movie promotion and production. At that point RDI was a little over $3/share.  RDI hasn't been at $5/share since November 2021 - at which point I might add CNK was trading above $20/share. Yes CNK is trading up at $28/share and RDI is trading down at $1.6/share from that point in time. With all the equity CNK issued in their convert and no equity issuance from RDI, the valuation multiple disparity is even greater. You want to focus on the past, I want to invest in the future. I would take RDI shares at present prices over CNK shares at present prices.",2024-09-24
"@Andrew Shapiro . Respectfully, the “far greater likelihood to be a multibagger from here v CNK” was the predominant thought of RDI bulls when CNK was $8 and RDI was say $5 just 18 months ago. “Multibags” will still leave this stock down 80% from pre-pandemic. CNK was PRUDENT - and PRESCIENT - selling convertible equity. I’m not remotely current on MCS and the others don’t warrant comment. Had RDI sold equity investors would have been in MUCH better shape (of course investors can’t be in worse shape with any portfolio name than this..again, not going to dignify the other dreck chains). Again, if there was such compelling allure than more than one insider - as noted on this board there’s 6 making $500k annually and for years & years & years - would scrape together a few cents to buy some stock. Even a decent piece of the nominal bounce in the stock was eviscerated over the past 2 days (when the market again went up big). I assume the company is now in “quiet period” so all the insiders that are fighting over each other to buy stock (not!) will have to wait till almost Thanksgiving to enter their orders. More likely they’ll chuckle over Turkey about how much money they take from the company while milking it dry; then for dessert they’ll laugh about how their beyond-arrogant Dad managed to build up such an investor scam that they can continue to perpetuate.",2024-09-20
"@FMA1995 The real estate has been proven to be far from worthless. It has funded all of the companies Pandemic losses and more. NAV of the company of course has diminished with these sales but RDI did not have to sell equity (whether via BK reorg like Cineworld, stock sales like AM, or convertibles like CNK or MCS) to basically be today at pre-pandemic net debt levels. The family 'problems' (and shareholders change of control catalyst) went completely away with the global settlement of all trust and estate litigation following the untimely and unfortunate death of the Cotter sisters younger brother Jim, Jr. over two years ago now. There is nothing 'complicated' by the company's share class structure it is quite straightforward non-voting and voting classes. That being said, the sisters control 70% of the vote (but also own more sizable quantities of the non-voting RDI) and are not interested in selling so there is no change of control catalyst to be investing in this for. And indeed RDI now clearly has a far GREATER likelihood to be a multi-bagger from here than CNK.",2024-09-19
CNK pushing towards $30 (up 4x over the past 18 months or so) - amazing what a turn and prospects for better (in cinema) can do for a professionally managed company with a straight forward business model v. one dependent on real estate sales just to stave off BK.  At least the heir-Cotter's are suffering with the voting stock (B) finally taking a hit -- not that this will change their MO.  Just sad.,2024-09-16
"@rjm22 He pounded it down with a 50K sale near the end of june at $1.29/share. Now he has been buying it back at 35% higher prices in the mid-$1.70s and you require him to bounce it more with a 50K block purchase? The fact that he is paying up much higher to repurchase in can only be a positive. This is especially so when everyone on this thread had a heart attack over his sales. He sold down his shares to 26,505 and now they are up to 61,505 shares.  Still not fully replaced what he sold but far better than nothing. You are correct that the others have not purchased any shares and are highly compensated, including a substantial amount of non-voting Class A share grants. They have an alignment of interest in their shareownership, but we all agree would have preferred they bought in the open market rather than grants. However, note their grants were at far higher issue prices and they had to pay taxes on those grants at grant or vesting date value.  If your ultimate definition of value trap is there is no catalyst for change of control - you are absolutely correct. However, IMO there is substantial upside in the current price to even a huge family control discount that will be realized upon the on-going and inevitable rebound in cinema cash flow, incremental rents on 44 Union Square, reduced interest expense from rates rolling over and more importantly debt paydown with asset sales proceeds, and monetization of non-cash flowing real estate (wellington courtenay central) for substantial gains.",2024-09-14
@Andrew Shapiro Hard to make it a big positive as it's going to take him awhile for him to get back to where he was 2500 at a time and there has been NO other insider buying.There are at least 6 reporting officers who pull out $450k-$620k a year and not a single one has bought shares in the open market. Not a single one of the other directors have bought in the open market.I have enough value traps. That's how I envision RDI.,2024-09-13
@bazooooka yes for reasons I discussed already. Box office has also bottomed too.,2024-09-13
@Charlie's Munger again more purchases by same director followers here fretted when he sold shares a much lower prices about 2 months ago - now clearly for tax loss realization purposes. It is pretty positive message when he comes back in for more and more shares at higher prices than his sale.,2024-09-13
@Charlie's Munger additional repurchases by a director whose sales over a month ago freaked out many of those here. He bought back in at higher prices. Clearly not just tax loss sale but also reaffirmation of prospective upside.,2024-09-10
