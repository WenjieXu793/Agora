"Paying with Paypal in online shops is a very good alternative to Amazon.In my opinion, Amazon's online service will continue to decline. Consumers will therefore look more for alternatives and Paypal is a very good alternative to pay online.I see a huge chance for a increasing stock price of PayPal.

"Thank you for a most balanced and unbiased article on a company that's been all the rage to rag on here for several years now, much of the criticism warranted.  Historically, many of the same type of companies going through turnarounds, make some of the best investments.  Unfortunately, patience is often in short supply for the prospective investor, and that's an absolute must for holding companies like PayPal for very long periods of time.PYPL is one of my older holdings, and I've held it through thick in thin.  My average price is still much lower than todays, and the recent price action has been enjoyable to witness.  Added consistently to grow my position when it bottomed out in the $50s and $60s and plan to enjoy the ride from here.  Recent new collaborations with the likes of Amazon, Shopify and growing crypto capabilities to businesses ought to provide some nice tailwinds going into 2025/2026.GL",2024-09-27

"@Carl Ericsson i do, hence, most (80%) my investments are in real estate. Rest of the 20% of my liquid assets goes to 10% cash, 10% everything else. That 10% most of it in shares 70% and rest is on others like you said, watches, some old books, and BTC. I think it SHOULD be part of the portfolio but not overwhelming the portfolio.",2024-09-26
"@deadhead213 Lots of comments on some of these articles deriding the company for the sins of its previous management team. New management is effecting a complete 180 in performance - not quite complete, but closing in on it. This really is a great lesson in how impactful the management team can be even for a large established company.",2024-09-26
