"Hi Leo,Own a fair amount of UNP and have done well with the stock. Often sell CC's on it for extra income since it is in a Roth... Tiger",2024-09-26
"Thanks Leo!  I like NSC as a company but think that turn around may be some time off.  As far as leading indicator transports go, I keep an eye on SBLK.  another company I like,  but until very recently hasn't shown much of an uptick in loads.  Keep up the good work!",2024-09-26
"@Leo Nelissen Thanks for noticing. I was extremely pleased. MU was our 9th largest position this morning, our 7th largest after the close today, and now has surged to 2nd largest after the huge spike in price following earnings. The conference call is underway, so the volatility is not over yet!",2024-09-25
"Thanks for your update on NSC, Leo. You answered my recent question in your first bullet point, in which you say:""I initially considered selling Norfolk Southern Corporation to reduce my portfolio but decided to hold due to its wide moat, promising turnaround potential, and dividend growth.""I owned multiple railroads (the miniature kind that I operated on a complex series of tracks in our basement) when I was about 10 years old, but don't own any railroads now. In my diligent quest to reduce the size of our portfolios recently, I sold our exposure to railroads, slashed aerospace/defense stocks (but retained a position in RTX), dumped all of our consumer/packaged goods stocks, sold a bunch of semiconductor positions, and trimmed some of our positions in financials and mega tech stocks.The only sector bets that I have increased lately are (1) energy sector stocks that have declined as oil and natural gas prices have declined, and (2) my recent newer bets on MU and QCOM in the semiconductor sector. I'll find out whether my conviction purchase of MU was prudent when MU reports in less than an hour.",2024-09-25

Googled her name… dang bro I dunno how this is even a real thing,2024-09-11
"@Downtown10 That seems like a pretty good question, particularly given that NSC was already working its way out of some significant problems in recent years.",2024-09-11
"@Big Fat Dummy Impact on share price seems like it could be of concern here.  This isn't the only smudge on NSC in recent years.  They seemed to be crawling out of the hole, but this could be perceived negatively by Mr. Market.",2024-09-11
"@A812380   Buffett already has one, who else is going to buy a $60B railroad?",2024-09-11

"@Whiteshell Yeah. [sighs]  They used to call us ""the little GE"" so I take some satisfaction that GE is not what it used to be either.  One thing I have learned.  If an investment is called a ""sure thing"" it probably isn't.",2024-09-09
