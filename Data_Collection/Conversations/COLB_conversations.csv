I got up this morning and thought colb had popped up but it's just SA and their misinformation once again....shows up 4% but actually it's down on every other website.,2024-09-20
"@Albert Anthony They are already the product of dozens of acquisitions, so it's possible, but the CEO said in one of the recent calls or conference talks that he doesn't see a lot out there for inorganic growth that's appealing, and implied that special dividends would be more likely use of earnings...",2024-09-15
"@Mostly Small Caps interesting point, as it may be COLB that becomes the acquirer, eating up others like pacman :)",2024-09-15
"@Albert Anthony - GBCI (Glacier) is very acquisitive and may want to follow up on their acquisition of Eastern-Washington basd Wheatland Bank with a greater push into the NW.  However, COLB is big enough that it might be a stretch for the similarly sized (market cap) western bank",2024-09-15
"@WretchedBabbler appreciate your feedback and time which is valuable, and your take on a good entry point to pick up some shares of this stock.",2024-09-14
"Thanks for your helpful analysis of Columbia, which comes at an interesting moment when JP Morgan’s CFO said this week that net interest income will decline at the bank, prompting a broad sell off in banks.  Given that scenario, it might be a good strategy to wait on the October earnings report from Columbia before purchasing the stock where I am sure management will be probed on this topic. If the stock sells of, that strikes me as a good entry point where I strongly agree with your comments about the growth outlook for Seattle and other key Pacific Northwest markets.",2024-09-14
"@Albert Anthony  Umpqua Bank is how the company is known to consumers, but when Columbia bought it out and merged the two it did keep Columbia wealth advisors as the name of its wealth management arm.  They are working hard on winning public banking accounts - county and municipal governments, etc.  They are trying to integrate across their services. I like the management a lot. They know their region and they know what they can do distinctively from the national banks.",2024-09-13
"@thirdcamper appreciate your valuable feedback as always.  I am curious, as I wrote, whether they will increasingly try to penetrate more of the wealth advisory segment to boost fees-income and less reliance on interest income... and how would they fare with such big players in that space.",2024-09-13
"From strong buy to buy makes sense, but I definitely do consider COLB a buy still and think it will keep powering upward. Interest rate declines should lead to further mellowing of the fears around CRE - and increase borrowing in other areas to offset its concentration there, which is what the market has been bothered by.Dividend history is better than you indicate. A lot of special dividends. I expect to see more in future. A bargain, still.",2024-09-13
"…..to buy, however it does represent another avenue in which to continue to improve earnings going forward.   The div yield is attractive and should remain sustainable, with potential for 20% improvement in share price.   The company is also a potential acquisition target for a larger bank looking to enter the Pacific Northwest.",2024-09-13
"It is also still cutting costs post merger of Umpq/Colb.  Buy itself, this is not a strong reason",2024-09-13
