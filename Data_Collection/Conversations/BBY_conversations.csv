"@pakrolltide It might be pollyannish to say it out loud, but we either begin to ignore the onslaught of must-have or best-of lists, celebrity endorsers, and other nonsense, and strive for a simpler traditional holiday time, or our deficits and debts will do it to us.",2024-09-18
"@VoiceofSanitySometimes Update:  Mortgage report out this AM and refis up double digit % over last week and last year, while purchase mortgages up slightly week to week but still lower than last year.  Only a few weeks data so we need to see the broader trend, but certainly interesting and worth following.Could be good news for Christmas retail as consumers extend their debt, but we've seen this act before where homeowners over-extend themselves against their home equity....",2024-09-18
@Phil Dumfee Any company which uses Christmas as a prop to get people to spend but yet cannot utter the actual word Christmas will not get a single penny from me.,2024-09-18

"Good ideas and theory on this press release, but way too much research for this ancient investor. Anyone have recommendations if there is/are mid-cap tech ETFs or CEFs to look at? I'd be happy to get decent performance with diversified tech risk from a mid cap fund.",2024-09-10

I'd like at least 3 to be mid-caps. I'm really eyeing TER, but my portfolio is already considerably overweight in the semiconductor industry.",2024-09-10
