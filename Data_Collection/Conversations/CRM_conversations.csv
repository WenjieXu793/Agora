"@reasonableperson1 So, do we need to own every single stock that we research about?",2024-10-06
"I closed my position in CRM on Friday. In $212, out: $286. Yes, there is risk to the upside, I believe that. It’s going higher and I will leave money on the table. It’s way too hard for me to predict bottom’s and tops. Right now, it’s time to focus on what I call the “greed factor” and move on.",2024-10-06
"You thought it was a buy and you say that it still is a buy.  Which is interesting coming from a guy who doesn't own a share.  So, is it a buy just for me and other readers?  Do you not take your own advice?",2024-10-06
"I read your article with special interest this morning, because I have traded in and out of CRM successfully this past year. I recently sold CRM based upon price. Actually, I think I am doing far better trading my preferred SaaS stocks CRM, NOW and ADBE than I might otherwise have done by just owning them outright for the long term. Each of these three names seems too expensive right now. Although I did buy a half position in ADBE for $405 last week. I wanted some exposure to software other than through my major investments in AVGO and MSFT.The specific reason why I am trading rather than owning these volatile software stocks is for fun and profit, and because their prices are so stratospheric from my perspective that I worry more about their potentially material pullback in prices than their immediate appreciation potential. The risk/reward just isn't that compelling to me. As soon as I dip my toes in, I am immediately looking for the exit sign!!Thank you for this excellent article. You present lots of facts to assess while considering an investment in CRM.",2024-10-06
@DT Invest not factually correct...the  crm/spy pair (measure of relative performance) went from near 4 sigma rich in november 2021 to near 3 sigma cheap in december 2022...it then went from near 2 sigma rich in march 2024 to near 1.5 sigma cheap in may,2024-10-04
What an unexpected beast move today!Agent force. You feel me?Long from $222.,2024-10-02
good article...added to CRM as the crm/spy pair broke out of multiweek range.. the pair went from 2 sigma rich in february to near 1.5 sigma cheap in may (3yr horizon) ...currently trading near fair.. on absolute basis close above 278.57 confirms,2024-10-02
"I believe your thesis is heavily flawed. Salesforce isn't ""a CRM app"". It hasn't been that in over 15 years. It is a platform. A cloud. In fact it's one of the original cloud platforms that predates the term ""cloud"". AI can write code. Sometimes it's working code even. I personally write code and I use AI to assist my efforts. And that code runs on Salesforce. Because as I stated previously, it's a platform, not an app. You say that Salesforce will be affected by competitors using AI to write code that competes with it. You say that 25 years of their existing product code will weigh Salesforce down. I disagree. Do you research. Start with these:Agentforce for Developers - Salesforce's own AI codegen product for writing code with AI that runs on Salesforce released in 2023 as Einstein for Developers.Hyperforce - Moving 25 years of infrastructure to Amazon's AWS to deliver all of that value even cheaper, faster, and in a more scalable way. Disclaimer: very long CRM, and will happily buy your shares on dips. I'm not an insider but I have worked in the Salesforce ecosystem for the last 20 years.",2024-10-02
"@Benjamin Graham Cracker that's right!, Peter Gassner was a former employee in Salesforce, but I think he discovered a space where Salesforce was weak: the life science industry. Gassner ended up setting up Veeva Systems, and I think knowing how Salesforce operaates, he worked so hard to innovate so fast to have a big advantage in the life science industry. Now, CRM has a partnership with IQVIA, but Veeva innovates way faster than IQVIA, at least, that's what I've seen in the last decade. Maybe the market right now is not fully understanding what is the Veeva's vision for the long term which is to have a full ecosystem of integrated softwares covering different critical areas under the same CRM platform. I do not see neither Salesforce nor IQVIA in this path. Veeva was using paart of the Salesforce CRM platform until recently, right now, Veeva is in a process of migration to its own CRM (Veeva Vault CRM). So Veeva pays a fee to Salesforce for the usage of its CRM plartform, and that was a way in which Salesforce was exposed to the life science industry. But that contract will end soon, so Salesforce is reacting to keep beeing exposed to the life science industry through a partnership with IQVIA. Of course Salesforce is well diversified through different sectors, and Veeva needs to protect its moat in the life science industry, so that's why Veeva is advancing and innovating faster. If salesforce fails in the life science industry, nothing happens, as it is well diversified, but if Veeva fails, its entire business model can be disrupted, so that's why Veeva does not have any debt, it's very conservative in its capital allocation, and innovates faster than competitors as a way to protect its business model from disruption.  Veeva's TAM is $20 billion so, there is lots of room to keep growing in the long term for Veeva.",2024-10-01
"@Is2 Dive4 I mean, Veeva was originally built on top of Salesforce, until recently. So, why couldn't Salesforce do the same thing?",2024-09-30
"@rygo  - Spot on assessment. The true value add here with VEEV is the combined App suite of Vault  and CRM together.  That is a deep penetrating moat and adds substantive value and silos, ...proprietary to VEEV. Salesforce does not have a comp solution set. Ai is the buzz phrase and shiny new objects abound everywhere. To your point: Standards, Compliance and the whole deep network for creation, capture, integration and processing as well as communication within this vertical is decades of dedicated proprietary work, specific to this sector. It is now a foundational critical infrastructure component and virtually ubiquitous.",2024-09-30
"Analyst misunderstanding of what VEEV does and what CRM offers today. Two different offerings, maybe CRM will have something in the future that will eat VEEV's lunch; however they may be preparing something of their own.",2024-09-30
"@rygo agree, maybe those analysts want to listen about any trash product but named with ""AI"".....right now, the life science industry has different sort of softwares from different vendors and very disconnected among them. The future is to offer an entire ecosystem of software products that cover different areas while storing data.....data that can be used in AI models. I think that Veeva is the only one who has this long term vision...to offer the data that can be ran in AI models in the future. Right now, it's not possible to build a viable and truly value added software with AI...since things in the Life Science industry works in a different way.",2024-09-30
"I'm sure AI has a future in life sciences tech, but I will not get to excited about any company's AI narrative in this space until they can demonstrate CFR Part 11 compliance & have clients that have successfully gotten through an FDA submission that includes data/processes that utilized the tech.  There are plenty of things to do on the research side with AI, but VEEV has primarily specialized in the creation/capture/transmission of regulated data, which is inherently slower to evolve and has a huge trust hurdle to overcome (and in this case it's a slow-moving govt agency that will need to get comfortable to accept the usage of this new tech).  I'm thinking of clinical operations, trial data, safety, quality, and regulatory related products.Maybe there is more of a threat in the commercial (CRM, etc.) side of the business, but the other stuff is the core value chain.To be fair, I haven't looked into what was presented at Dreamforce this month, just speaking from work history in life sciences tech.  Like any AI tech narrative, AI tech in the LifeSci space deserves a ""show me where you did this already"" approach.",2024-09-30
"I sold CRM last week. I couldn't resist harvesting the quick gain I received by trading CRM aggressively for the third time this year. With a p/e higher than other more reliable tech stocks, a minimal dividend yield, and volatility based upon AI hype, it's far more fun to trade this stock than own it!",2024-09-29
