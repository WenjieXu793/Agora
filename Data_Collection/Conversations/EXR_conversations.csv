"Aren't $SVI:CA and $BYLOF aren't better buys compared to US storage REITs? They, until recently, were well-priced.",2024-09-04
"Good article thank you.  An area where management could do better is in customer loyalty and retention; important to me because I invest for the longer term--particularly concerning equities providing consistent dividend growth.  For personal and business needs I continuously rent storage units in several states.  In the past year, Extra Space Storage has increased my unit rents approximately 100% in two locations which forces me (and others) to take our storage business elsewhere.  In one location, I had rented the unit 3 months only before the increase.  While the company has the right to raise rates monthly, as you point out, it works against the company for steady long-term income.  Short term, it bumps up profits, because people have to wait a few months until they have time to relocate their storage items, however, they eventually do relocate.  And those people are left with a dislike for the company.  Looking to an uncertain future demand for storage, Extra Space Storage would benefit by improving customer loyalty and retention.",2024-09-03
