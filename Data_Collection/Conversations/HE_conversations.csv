"@rfwilliams1958 If they can survive for 8 quarters or at least not dilute too much more there is a CHANCE that crypto mining, data centers and Hawaii's obsession with going green will allow enough revenue growth to get them over the finish line and take the stock from $7 to $15 by Q1, '27",2024-10-03
@PennyPlanSupporter It is time to raise the kWh rates. Blame it on the county and the PUC.,2024-10-03

"@beachdr exactly , with 4 years to pay the final 500mm, 4 years making 100-150mm a year gets them there easily",2024-10-03

@PennyPlanSupporter $75 million paid up front. $558 million already diluted in an offering last week. $500-800 million from selling the bank. Maybe $400 billion in tax savings. Still doesn't quite get them there.,2024-10-03
How will they pay $2 billion without diluting the shareholders into oblivion?,2024-10-03

@Vlae Kershner this seems to be a PCG situation all over again and I expect shareholders to be made whole but not for another 5 years or so.,2024-09-27
"@LLCapital I put in some numbers on Google sheets. Hopefully the link works? Otherwise, I can write it out here. docs.google.com/...",2024-09-26
"@Structured Returns Right. It's a paradoxical yet perhaps not uncommon situation where the company is worth more after dilution (because the dilution is fixing a problem that depresses the value of the company). Happens near bankruptcy, too, right? Company nearly out of cash = nearly worthless, then sells stock, no longer out of cash = worth a lot. It is a paradox.It's just surprizing that this is manifesting with HE to the extent that it did. It is an astronomical dilution (50%) after all.",2024-09-25
"@Dream On '59 The $250 million is an at the market, as and when needed registration It can still be exercised whenever they want and on whichever days they want. that was a back up, but seems weird as seems interest at the price for the volume is pretty bullish.",2024-09-25
Market always knows the price.Sounds bullish considering the percentage dilution.Perhaps the market is seeing the settlement being paid quicker than expected now and dividends coming back sooner?,2024-09-25
@fishfin your math is missing the offset of reduced liability with the cash raised,2024-09-25
"@Wellington999 If the institutions are getting it at $9.25, $7.50 is not likely to happen.  Also, low is $7.60 when HE was thought to have $5B+ liability and possible bk.  That narrative is over.",2024-09-25
"@Charlie's Munger Who is Evercore?  Might as well say ""Charlie's Investments""Rest of the Street has average $15 target.",2024-09-25
