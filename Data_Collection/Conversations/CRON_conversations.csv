"@A Curious Investor Yes, Altria backing is an important factor. It's also good to see Altria stock trending higher after an extended period of price and time correction. I expect the same for Cronos once they bring the cash glut to use.",2024-08-28
"I bought some shares at $2.29, more at $2.23 and a good size chunk this morning at $2.16.  I don't know if this will ever be a good business.  Governments seem to want to tax the heck out of cannabis, so much so that users seem to go to their old, illegal, dealers to buy.  Having said that, I figure I'm getting the business for free since the market cap is roughly equivalent to cash on the balance sheet.  If anyone is going to succeed at the legal pot business, Cronos has as good a chance as anyone since it has a lot of cash, hopefully smart managers and a very strong friend in the form of Altria.  Good luck to us all",2024-08-28
