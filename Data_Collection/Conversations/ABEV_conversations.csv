"ABEV is extremely undervalued on a yield basis (over 6%) alone. Anemic debt to equity ratio, stable and growing revenues/earnings, even if in the low single digits, and no issue whatsoever with the payout ratio. Considering BUDS 61+% anchor / stable ownership and the precipitous drop in the stock price over the last year, this stable “value” dividend stock has the prospect of double digit returns if the share price simply reverts to mean. Have owned, will continue to own and will accumulate. A no brainer in an overvalued market.",2024-09-28

"InBev owns 62%. At some point they seem likely to purchase the rest, particularly as cheap as it is.",2024-09-17
