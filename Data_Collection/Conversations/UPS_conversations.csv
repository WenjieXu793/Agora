Many complained about the UPS union agreement wage increases of 25% for 5 years!  Look at the Teamsters at 62% for 6 years.,2024-10-06
"@Grad91 Not at all. Those are much smaller packages that weigh less than 60 lbs. You’re not gonna see AMZN drivers delivering the big ones. They also don’t have the airlift capability of UPS, DHL or even FDX. Their air fleet is all 757 and 767 airframes, and lack the kind of air hubs UPS has (e.g. Louisville, Ontario, Philly). UPS’ fleet includes 747s in addition to its 757s, 767s, and A-300s - all of which grants them a much bigger airlift capability than AMZN. Now if you want to talk about AMZN being a better overall stock, I would agree (I hold AMZN myself) - but that’s due to retail, advertising and being the world’s largest cloud service provider. Logistics isn’t the big mover for that company they way it is for UPS and FDX.",2024-10-06
"@Grad91 Actually, all those Amazon Prime packages people are ordering go thru UPS because at the end of the day, AMZN’s fleet simply isn’t as big as UPS’, not to mention their drivers aren’t allowed to deliver/carry heavy packages like UPS drivers can. Besides, AMZN really shouldn’t be put in the same category as UPS and FDX. It’s apples and watermelons..",2024-10-05
"@Equityhigher was going to mention the Covid highs myself.  I went back to the graphs highlighted in the story, and they all started at the end of the pandemic period, which was an unnatural high point by which to start analysis, imo.  A better proposition would have started somewhere in the 2015-2018 range so that the pandemic’s outlier effects were put into context.At the end of the day, UPS is in an oligopoly with FedEx, Amazon, and the post office.  DHL is barely a minor player domestically.  In that group of competitors, Amazon has the advantage of capitalization and a built-in consumer base, but I’d take UPS next.  It just happens to do business in a very cyclical environment.",2024-10-05
This analysis left out very significant information for any investor. Things like the labor union agreement for example. And utilizing only trailing PE ratio is a big no no. Investors care about the future rather than the past. Skate to where the puck is as Gretzky would say. I don’t disagree with the idea that UPS has risks and is a bit of a “show me” investment. But this analysis doesn’t provide an accurate or complete picture of the company’s pluses and minuses.,2024-10-05
"A few modifications to your story… first, UPS is headquarters in Atlanta, GA., whereas Seattle was where it was founded. Covid drove a significant deviation is the entire global supply chain. As areault, logistics plays like UPS had a windfall but also caused disruption and capacity constraints.  As a result, financials topped the charts and rightly so as “volume” surged. So the decline in volume over the previous quarters from Q223 was driven by rebalancing and returning to normalization. Worthy to note that new volume entered the market due to the force of many businesses shifting volume to a higher percent e-commerce channels. Then Labor negotiations was up which started in May 2023 (Q223)… some large businesses diverted to the competition to protect their business… understandable!  However, a strike was averted about 2-3 weeks prior to contract exploitation on July 31, 2023. As a result, the result was a significant increase in expense with the largest impact the first year of the new contract, which recently lapped the 12-month mark this past August 2024. So to return to growth washes away a significant portion of headwinds and a positions a turning point. The rest of your story does not highlight recent developments such as grabbing USPS contract from FedEx after 20 yrs, lap front-loaded labor related cost, automation, AI integration, healthcare advances, RFID deployment, fully integrated network (which is what fed ex is trying to do), international growth, and recent staff reductions over $1B in expense to streamline internal connectivity and redundancy. Albeit, external factors that are uncontrollable like inflation, global conflict, etc. Have an impact but focus on what can be controlled will close the gap.",2024-10-05
"@northharrow This is a great point. It's hard to value the goodwill of employees. Overtime, it can pay itself back with less churn. Maybe Amazon wants the churn...",2024-10-05
UPS has commendable employment policies which result in the retention of older workers. As a result they tend to be less competitive with delivery services such are as used by Amazon and others.,2024-10-05
"@gofergold1 two years ago, UPS foolishly raised its dividend by 49%. It has never done anything close to that and it has pulled from future increases. It also gave the Teamsters bargaining leverage because the company couldn’t cry poverty",2024-10-01
@Britton Bush and a 25 year record of solidly inferior capital appreciation,2024-10-01
Down of late? Try 2 1/2 years. It peaked I believe in the $220s.,2024-10-01
"@New Adams I have more faith in USPS than UPS. In the long run AMZN will own the logistics business. IMO that's UPS's biggest challenge. AMZN has orders for 100,000 Rivian vans. UPS has a total of about 115,000 delivery vans. Think about that for a moment. Also, AMZN pay scale for loaders and drivers is much less than UPS. I think UPS has seen its best days as the dominant package delivery player. I am just looking beyond the horizon which, IMO, is the way you make money investing in stocks.",2024-10-01
I’m long. Bought at the low and today went past 136. I’m happy. Guess I look at things a little differently than a lot of authors here states not buying or sell or the opinions they give. I read your article. A lot of numbers and technicals. I’m happy and still adding on dips. Glta,2024-09-30
"Bias confirmed—thanks. It would be nice to pick up the name for just an earnings shortfall and Mr. Mkt is making the s/p pay. Buying in during an operational shortfall like recently tho, one has to swallow hard. The commenters have already made solid points supporting the company and the critical nature of what it does. The union contract will have to be rationalized over time, and the hope is the CEO comments are on point, and she knows her stuff. On the positive side, fuel is cheaper, and interest rates going in the right direction may make for more UPS traffic, both large and small deliveries. As long as mgt stays true to their words, and there is a robust payout (like now), I will stay with (and add to) the name.",2024-09-28
"@LostinShalimar I’m advocating for a long term buy and hold of UPS for a dividend growth strategy. SGOV, a 0-3 month treasury bonds ETF, will most certainly go below 5% if the fed continues to cut rates as expected.  UPS dividend yield would go below 4.8% only if it suspends or reduces its dividend payout. Although that’s not impossible, it does seem unlikely given UPS’s dividend history and the commitment from current UPS CEO Carol Tome.  She has reaffirmed recently her and UPS’s commitment to maintaining the dividend.  If you look at UPS’s dividend growth history, and make a conservative assessment of continued dividend growth, then we can expect a higher than 4.8% yield on cost over the long run if purchased at the current stock price.  Alpha spreads currently projects an intrinsic value, based on discount cash flow and relative valuation analysis, of $161, implying a 17% undervaluation. What timescale are you filtering on the price chart?  If I filter on the past 10 years UPS price has increased ~30%, total return (inclusive of dividend) has been ~250%.My point is that UPS’s business is resilient, due to its critical nature for economic operations.  One recent example of this is UPS’s impressive performance relative to other businesses during the pandemic.  An interesting thought, I think, is an assessment of what’s riskier,  the US defaulting on their debt ( which happens to be quite substantial at the moment ) or people and businesses not receiving the goods and packages they need / want to live and operate?  I understand that UPS has competition, however given its market share and reach it could be considered somewhat critical, I think.  At this price, the return reward prospects (inclusive of dividend) seems quite favorable relative to its risk and relative to other “risk free” investments.  That’s my thought / opinion..",2024-09-28
@Britton Bush One look at the price chart of this critical asset and I say no way.  I'd rather hold the 1% cash that I'd typically invest in a single stock. SGOV is paying 5%+ btw.,2024-09-27
"Nice yield on UPS, but has a high payout ratio.",2024-09-27
"We could collect the ""risk free rate"" on a 10 year U.S. treasury note at ~3.76%.  Alternatively, we can collect 4.8% dividend yield on a company that is fundamentally critical to the operations of the U.S. economy and has shown a ~25 year history of dividend growth.  UPS is a BUY.",2024-09-27
In 2018 (mgmt buyout) UPS was at $119 now $126.  $7 in 6 years and Market is hitting record highs - go figure. LEADERSHIP left in 2018. Replaced by ???,2024-09-20
@Yanks56 Amazon are building routes off High Dense area ( reduce cost to deliver). Taking the profitable packages from UPS producing low density routes - the high cost to deliver packages are given to the Post Office - since they have to deliver the mail anyway.,2024-09-20
