"Just discovered this company. What's up with the negative (common) equity? When I first look at a new stock, that's usually where I start - a quick review to (hopefully) see that the company is increasing common equity, not diluting thre heck out of its shareholders, etc. One of several dozen ""checkpoints"" I run through quickly on the financials of a new stock to get familiar w/ the dollars and cents side of the business. Did not get very far on MCK given the steadily declining common equity and wanted to come here and ask first, before spending a ton of time. Any answers? Obviously ""equity"" is a fungible number and more important for some companies than others, or sometimes, not at all. Thanks in advance!",2024-10-06

"Looking at the long term chart, it looks like the company became overbought, just like in 2015. The stock has usually traded at or below 15x earnings for the past 20 years, with it trading in the trashcan around 8-11x earnings from 2016-2022.It traded near 15x earnings once more from 2022 through late 2023, when it suddenly blew up to 21x earnings, a level it hasn't seen since... 2015. I think there's a good chance this thing bottoms around 15x earnings, which would be $450-$480 today. That would be a reasonable price looking at forward growth projections and historic valuations. It appears to be there after today's selloff.I suspect this is a decent level to add shares or start a position. I'm not sure the selloff is over when the stock previously averaged 10.5x earnings from 2016-2022.",2024-09-24
@Merit1 The sell-off looks like an opportunity to accumulate more shares to me. My position is full now and I will hold from now on. I believe this will be an excellent DGI stock in the next decadeLong $MCK,2024-09-24

"Good article. I am looking to deploy my cash as my previous expectation of a steeper market correction turned out to be incorrect. I am a buyer at today's price of ~$507.I think the valuation was too low in the previous years which is why I disagree with the Fast Graph that implies overvaluation. Many great companies have stagnated at 15x PE before expanding their multiples to 30x. This might become one of them, given the high earnings growthLong $MCK",2024-09-19
"@Celandina Berkshire had briefly owned it several years ago, but it was sold relatively quick.",2024-09-19
"I purchased a few shares of MCK to open a position in August and more than doubled that during the selloff between Sep 5 - 10. I also own COR as part of my exposure to the Health Care sector. While COR has a slightly higher dividend yield, MCK has a lower FWD PEG and better potential price gain. Both have better total returns than CAH over 5 and 10 years, although CAH does have a better yield for investors who prefer that over growth.",2024-09-15

I always considered it a buffet style stock but never pulled the trigger - always seemed a bit lofty price wise..,2024-09-15
@ndardick You're not the only one. I expect people to be very careful until the meeting. Thank you for this info!,2024-09-15
"@Leo Nelissen Ok, I have finished my analysis of SLB. Based upon the minimal premiums investors are now willing to pay for put protection on the November 2024 and January 2025 $40 strikes, I have concluded that SLB has likely bottomed and would make a credible short term trade. However, I am reluctant to put any money to work prior Wednesday or Thursday when I can assess the pin action following the Fed's decision and Powell's presser in terms of its impact on the meat of our portfolio. SLB is just a side salad here!",2024-09-15
"@Leo Nelissen Yes. I am almost finished with my analysis of SLB.I am discouraged that CFRA just yesterday set only a $42 12-month price target on SLB. I respect their work a lot.I am encouraged by the following statement by an author whom I revere in an article that he published on July 3, 2024, in which he said:""Despite my preference for upstream companies, SLB's impressive transition and market positioning put it in a great spot to deliver potentially elevated returns on a prolonged basis.""You might be extremely familiar with the author to whom I refer, because he resembles you quite a bit! Here is the link to your earlier article on SLB:seekingalpha.com/...",2024-09-15
@ndardick Do you remember the XOM chart I showed in one of my articles? That massive CapEx is needed to sustain oil production? That is a huge tailwind for SLB (and HAL).,2024-09-15
"@Leo Nelissen Will do! Thanks for bringing up a good point for me to consider. Perhaps SLB would be good for the portion of my investment portfolio that I consider an excellent choice for a trade rather than a long time hold. It's a great thing that I am merely considering tinkering with our portfolio with this idea this morning, meaning that overall I am quite content with our existing positions with regard to balance, diversification, income yield, safety and upside potential.",2024-09-15
"@ndardick SLB is great! However, because oil companies prefer growing free cash flow over CapEx spending, I like upstream companies (producers) a bit more than equipment & service providers. Thank you for your comment. Let me know what you decide! :-)",2024-09-15
"I really appreciate this article for bringing me up to speed on MCK. I didn't realize it had such a diversified footprint in healthcare. It does seem like an amazing company with solid long term potential.However, as you recognized in your article, the dividend is not sufficient for me to find it as ""compelling"" as you do now. In my view, there are many more appealing higher dividend paying choices that you have recently brought to our attention. And, frankly, the other choices offer more than the 15-20% 12-month price appreciation that the consensus of analysts envision for MCK.Wow! This comment is too short to be consistent with my personality. So I will digress and add that, despite already being heavily over-weighted the energy sector, I am doing a deep dive into SLB this morning because I am inclined to add it to our concentrated portfolio that I worked very hard to whittle down from 34 to 28 stocks over the past couple of weeks. SLB has fallen faster than MCK, and offers a higher dividend yield (2.75%) and substantially more upside potential. The consensus analyst 12-month price target of $65 is 60% higher than its current market price of $40. Do the math! SLB sports a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 9.4, a p/e of only 11, and an incredibly low PEG ratio of 0.62. It's in the energy sector, but in a very different way (being focused on equipment and services) than the other energy stocks that I already own.I know you didn't ask me to play ""Would you rather?"" this morning, but I would rather buy SLB than MCK.Buckle up for Wednesday, everyone! With investors split 50/50 on whether the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 bps or 50 bps, half of the investors will be deciduously disappointed. I'm predicting a 25 bps cut myself, but will be focused more on what Fed Chief Jay Powell says than what the Fed does on Wednesday. Regardless, I expect a selloff Wednesday afternoon, and am planning accordingly.",2024-09-15
"The 3 comparison stocks contain 2 of the most interesting long term stocks in the market today for defensive investors from my view.  I'm not sure about the dividend angle but total return is all that matters in the end. MCK and COR.  I've done a lot of business with Cardinal over the years so I'll have to revisit CAH although I'm guessing there's a reason Cardinal is not on the list and COR and MCK are top positions. If there's a better way to play healthcare defensively, I'd love to know it. Maybe UNH, Elevance, and MOH ?  Combine them with some garbage WM, WCN , RSG, and boring may be beautiful.",2024-09-15
$370 to $400 price target. No way. It's a buy right here. Start nibbling. It's an oligopoly with Cardinal and Cencora.,2024-09-10
