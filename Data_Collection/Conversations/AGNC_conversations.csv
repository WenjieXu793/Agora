"@Johnbilik True, but that is a maybe in the crystal ball and I personally don’t care so much about the vacillating of price since I’m not a trader. If the is something materially that changes with either management or the business then that’s different. I care more about management and the continuation of the dividend and in this case the good possibility of increases of the dividend over the next few years since I lean more towards an income investor. In the long run rates must come  down and that is the long game, at least it is for me.",2024-10-08 11:48:09.116973

"@Bill Gunderson Oh, my.  Please look at AGNC's own website for their stock quotes as you seem to be using bad data. At no time in 2008 - 2009 did AGNC share price suffer a ""65.7%"" loss.  Regardless of your 2008 faux-fright, I prefer to cherry pick from March '09 with share price of $15 to it's peak of $31 SIX months later to close the year at $27.investors.agnc.com/...Why did they get ""clobbered""? Pretty sure you're old enough to recall the 2007 Global Financial Crisis. From AGNC's Sept 2009 10-Q  ""Since the middle of 2007, banks, investment banks, independent finance companies and insurance companies have announced extensive losses from exposure to the U.S. mortgage market. These losses have reduced financial industry capital leading to reduced liquidity for mortgage assets, more volatile valuations of mortgage assets and in some cases forced selling of mortgage assets. As a result, there was less financing available on attractive terms for mortgage assets in 2007 and 2008.""In Sept 2008 the Federal Housing Finance Agency took over Fannie Mae and the other GSEs. The repo and GSE market took a great deal of confidence from this which explains why AGNC recovered so quickly.  AGNC was not alone in suffering downdrafts in 2007, the DJIA had over a 30% drop during your time frame.""In response, actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve (“FRB”) and the U.S. Department of Treasury (“U.S. Treasury”) appear to have helped to stabilize the investing and financing environment for agency securities. The liquidity facilities created by the FRB during 2007 through 2009 and its lowering of the Federal Funds Rate target to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%, along with the reduction of the 30-day LIBOR to 0.25% as of October 16, 2009, have lowered our financing costs and stabilized the availability of repurchase agreement financing.""With their residential mortgage and repo financing markets stabilized, mREITs were able to  generate very respectable earnings from 2008 to 2012. It's a shame you're so misguided on this sector.""You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal . . .""",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
default risk is the last thing you should be thinking about with AGNC.  if the gov't stops the implied backstop of the MBS portfolio that AGNC owns... then things will have gotten  medieval and your portfolio will be the least of your concerns.,2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
My interest rate crystal ball says it’s a very good time to be buying AGNC.,2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
Took the profit and sold half my AGNC preferreds. They pay below below the industry average and lots of negative reviews by analysts are either a crock or it means they shouldn't pay so low. Believe the articles or believe the big money?,2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@Dividend Miner I agree. This stock is very misleading. All these seeking alpha articles hyping up the yield and then guess what, the stock price tanks and you're in the red even with the yield which you now need to wait a year to be in the green and that's if the stock price doesn't fall further.  Somehow these too good to be true opportunities are not as easy as perceived unless you get them at a big discount to today's prices like some people have in which case good for them, but not at today's prices.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
@G.Ray I'm just saying it's not the same but some people put too much credit to dividend paying stocks and their yield. My preferred investment is growth potential and if there's a dividend it's a bonus.   I want my total value to grow and not fade away.   Bottom line for me is the end value as I can skim off the profits along the way and grow the wealth.   So I am not disagreeing with you guys. Sure thing about buying a reit at a lower point and hopefully it goes up in price appreciation along with the dividend yield.  Ihave found too many other stocks to invest in which give me much more money than the measly reit return. I could put 100k into a reit but 20k plus in a year seems to be akeeper with me.   Yes REITS and other stocks can both drop in value. Funny thing about it is yields go up as value drops kinda like a stock split.,2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@Bill Gunderson You're probably right. AGNC makes money on the spread of their financing cost versus the mortgage rate. They have lots of extreme low financing contracts expiring, some as low as .6% and those will surely rise when renewed. Meanwhile, mortgage rates are falling, so their spread is falling. The only thing in their favor is that they have a gigantic book of mortgages and as rates fall, those become more valuable so their book value will likely rise.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@Bill Gunderson ""I have an article on the REITs coming soon.""You might want to do a little more research and put more critical thinking into it than you did for AGNC. This is the best time in the REIT cycle to buy in.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@GetRealHere ""REITs are already awful investments""I truly hope you might be able to see beyond the recent past. REITs are cyclical. This is the best time in the cycle to get into REITs. You will be kicking your future self if you don't.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@GetRealHere ""The price erosion from $35 to $10...""You have cherry picked the worst possible scenario, and even then the total return is positive at about 40%, not wonderful by any means, but still positive. And that would apply ONLY to someone who ill-advisably bought at the top. Anybody who bought in between 35 and 10 would have a better result. That is looking in the rear view mirror.  What does one think will happen in the future as interest rates drop, or even if they don't drop, as AGNC adjusts its portfolio over time?",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@jnedmac ""Look at the long term charts of agnc and compare it to stocks...""One can't legitimately compare AGNC (debt) to equity stocks. You are shortchanging yourself if you do.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@Bill Gunderson Why is this a terrible time to buy? When would be a good time to buy? After the price has increased substantially? Don't you prefer to buy low?  AGNC invests in debt and should be compared to other debt investments. All debt is down in price. When interest rates and yield goes up, price goes down for existing debt; however when the debt is eventually paid, it is paid at full value.With the recent aggressive interest rate hikes, it should be understandable that debt price would be down. One can't legitimately compare to equity investments.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@Bill Gunderson Are you making this stuff up? Where does this come from? AGNC's IPO was in May 2008 at $20. A 65.7% decline means it would have had to reach $6.86 at some point. I'm looking at a monthly chart as of the 1st of every month, and AGNC didn't fall below $15.64 on July 1 2008 and went up from there. I'd say that AGNC held up quite well compared to everyone else.Do you even know what credit risk is? Even if AGNC had declined as you have claimed, it would be market sentiment, not credit risk. Everything tanked during that credit crises. That would have been an excellent time to buy though most people don't have the balls to do so.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"Everything depends on when you buy. I bought 3 so called horrible investments with T, mpw, and agnc. Buy low and hold collect dividend. In the green on all and collecting the yield.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"When I first started reading articles here at Seeking Alpha and investing, I heard about AGNC and bought it.Then they cut the dividend from 16 to 12 cents per month.  A few cents does not sound like much, but it was 25%.  That amounts to a big deal.  Then I also saw the price drop and I sold.I've now learned, as the author, @Bill Gunderson, demonstrates a loss of capital can occur.  Why would I want that?  The income is not guaranteed and quite simply, it is not enough to  justify the poor return on capital.That's just my opinion.  Happy investing to all.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
Look at the long term charts of agnc and compare it to stocks with double digit earnings and sales growth and paying a reasonable dividend and you can see what Gunderson is talking about.  Everyone has their own opinions on how to make money grow.  Truly REITS can be traded like stocks but not only for the yields.   Gunderson is not perfect but doesn't want you to follow the lemmings over the cliff.,2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
