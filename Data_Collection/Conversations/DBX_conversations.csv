Thanks for the analysis. I was a bit shocked by the massive stock based compensation of upwards of $300M. When filtering this out of FCF it appears a lot less cheap. But then again its at a significant discount to the market and is in an industry generally considered favorably in terms of valuations. A lot to think about!,2024-09-08
