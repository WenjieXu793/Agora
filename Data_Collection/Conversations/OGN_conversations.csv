No one seems to care.  Hated stock even with dropping interest rates. Definite buy as it drops,2024-10-02
@puffnstuff surprised it has even sold off into the high teens not like the overall market has gone down,2024-10-01
"@blaumeise This report was sent to me as related to DFS, Discover Financial.",2024-10-01

@jst And MRK loaded the spinoff with a significant amount of MRK debt.,2024-09-29
"OGN before earnings was always a dog. Shorties always use this time to shorten. I'm sure they will convince in 6 weeks with solid results.Without share buy backs shorties have easy games.But OGN is not strong enough to psay additional share buy backs. But they are strong enough to pay healthy dividends , serve their bonds and expand business .That's enough for now .",2024-09-26
@presikakid roivant has other projects that are pre revenue that were being overshadowed by this products average performance. Ogn has more international scale than even companies like Eli Lilly. So we can actually deliver the medication to more markets than roivant was considering when they made the deal. Should be good for both companies,2024-09-24
@blaumeise thank you.   Any sense of revenue profile and growth products?     I guess the question is why the seller was willing to let this go.,2024-09-24
Additional Nexplanon can reach blockbuster status this quarter with over 250 Mio $ revenue. Other successful products are Jade and Fertility should finally start growing.,2024-09-24

How does an acquisition of this product support the stated strategy of building a women’s health company?   I don’t see it but may be missing something and happy to be corrected.,2024-09-23
I got this loser in the spin-off. It’s a dog with fleas as Gordon Gecko would say. I hold a small position for the dividend but I would buy this loser or add/on if my life depended on it.,2024-09-22
Their forward P/E is less than 5 (non-GAAP) and forward P/FCF is only 6.7Why no multiple improvement?,2024-09-22
"I certainly agree with the article and even more so with the comments. The shares of OGN lost nearly 10 %, after having run up over 40%. The down draft was caused by a deal which costs relatively little, since most of the price is conditioned on future performance of the acquisition. Everyone believes the deal will enhance overall earnings within a few quarters and does not implicate the dividend or capital structure. Ergo. The pull back is a buying opportunity. The stock pays 5.75%. NO ONE SUGGESTS THE DIVIDED IS IN PERILTHE FED JUST LOWERED .5%. IT IS ON ITS WAY TO ANOTHER 1.5%THE DOLLAR WILL CERTAINLY GO DOWN. OGN’S FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ENHANCED. OGN HAS A STRONGLY GROWING BIOSIMILAR BUSINESS. AFTER THE FED FINISHES LOWERING, OGN TRADING NOW AT 4.5 TIMES EARNINGS, WILL HAVE AN EVEN LOWER RATIO, AT PRESENT PRICES. SO, IN A LOW INTEREST SENARIO, AT THE PRESENT DIVIDEND OF 1.12:                AT 28, OGN PAYS 4%                AT 34, OGN PAYS.3.33%IT IS NOT HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OGN WITHIN THE NEXT 12 TO 18 MONTHS  EVEN WITHOUT A RISING EARNINGS PER SHARE DUE TO EITHER OR BOTH, RISING SALES, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DOLLAR, AND CERTAINLY ENHANCED BY THE DOLLAR’S FALL. BOATER HAS IT BASICALLY RIGHT, IN MY VIEW, ALTHOUGH THE $54 INTRINSIC VALUE HE PLACES ON OGN WILL TAKE A FEW DIVIDEND HIKES AND AT LEAST THREE YEARS…BUT DOABLE.",2024-09-22
