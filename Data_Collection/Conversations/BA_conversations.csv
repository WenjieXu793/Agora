"I think this might be ready to run, at least into earnings. It might have already started. That wedge that formed on the DTL near $150 and the bounce that we got off it was a clue. A+ setup here. Earnings are on 10/23. Iâ€™m already long, so not a trade.",2024-10-06
BA is considering ~$10B in capital raise to go along with its ~$4B merger with Spirit aerosystems which also has about $4B in debt (if I recall some of it to Ba) and like BA has negative equity and is loosing $1B a year. With the strike costing an expected $1B per week. As pension/retirement is the issue I think BA should offer cheap options (say $5-$20) per share redeemable after 3-5 years going forward at about $5-10K per year in addition to a up front $2K per year for every year worked in the past 5. The contract can be worked such that the shares would be with whatever business owns BA as it might get claimed by creditors at this rate.,2024-10-06

@MySami it will be greatly reduced if Pooh decides to invade Taiwan. I think Putins disaster in Ukraine is giving him second thoughts.,2024-10-05
@123semi It's not in Putin's interest for him to unilaterally pull out of the Ukraine at this time..The West will have to offer Putin a plausible off ramp dealthat will allow Putin a reason to quit fighting.Putin has control of approx 20% of the Ukraine land mass.Most of it he has controlled since 2014.  Perhaps the best time to have seriously negotiated with Putin would have been 8 years ago...? As it stands now its absolutely fantasy to think Putin willexit the whole of Ukraine without Zelensky giving up someterritory to get a deal done.,2024-10-05

"@MySami really. Russia is already facing massive labor shortages amd inflation because of the lack of working age men. Drafted, fled the country or dead. You need to study Russian demographics. They are in big trouble.",2024-10-04
"@Ephmen85 All in all I like the setup. Personally I'd go farther Out-of-the-Money on the Long leg -- even at a greater initial cost -- for 2 reasons: a) historically strong support at 120 and b) selecting a higher Delta means the option contract and the stock will move closer to dollar-for-dollar in tandem. Nonetheless, you're in good stead. And should BA's fortunes improve under its new CEO, you'll benefit evermore to recoup your cost -- a jump in the underlying stock price will increase the value of your option. And if BA's stock really spikes up wildly, heck, you may want to Exercise early.As per your Short leg, IMHO, you're way too close to the money. Yes ,you collected phat premium but as of the closing bell today (Fri, Oct 4) you're already At-the-Money and well within reach of being Called away, which would terminate your Spread trade, negating some Theta (time premium) you paid for on the Long side.Monitor closely.... and if the short leg is In-the-Money nearing Expiration on 10/11/24, Roll the Short leg in a timely manner Up and Out for a NET CREDIT (re: don't panic by Rolling for a net debit).GL",2024-10-04
@StockJabber.com My point is that capital can come from many different sources.Traditional (Boeing) and alternative (IAM member families)The group that is able to access capital longer and in a way that preserves their future financial status will be able to hold on the longest and dictate the final terms of a contract settlement.I am not so sure the market is willing to accept a Boeing equity raise at this time for a stock price above $120.  at $120 an equity raise would make for BA to become a weak stock proposition.A debt offering in addition to the added debt required to close the Spirit AeroSystems purchase would send the Boeing interestexpense into the stratosphere....siphoning off lots of future cash flows.,2024-10-04
"@Felloni I agree if the old Boeing bean counters were the CEOs......But I thought Ortberg was brought in to start a new eraat Boeing, so I think he can break with traditional and be seen as a new CEO who is willing to sit down and talk with his workers to end this strike.If Ortberg does not actively get involved with negotiationsthen it tells me that he is a figurehead & that Calhoun and crony Pope are pulling the strings still at Boeing.Now is NOT the time for the new Boeing CEO to function with an aire of aloofness.",2024-10-04
@Socratic Method Boeing would not survive zero 737 Maxx production for the next 90 days.,2024-10-04
@olde1two IMO33-34% wage hike + a 10% Boeing employee pension contribution match ends this strike on Monday.,2024-10-04
@in crypto we trust .......and then try to re-start 737 Maxx production from scratch....?Do you have any idea what response the FAA would have toan Boeing action like that....????,2024-10-04
@Natturner1966 That will work in 2035 maybe...............but this is a 4 year contract.,2024-10-04
"@ZeissGirls Top management has been detrimental to Boeing for 15 years....!Its top management's fault Boeing is in weak financial straits.Layoffs, automation and outsourcing has already been triedby this management regime.  It didn't work...!33-34% wage hike plus 10 % Boeing pension employee match (plus the 4% automatic match) and this strike is over.Will Ortberg be strong enough to get this strike over....?So far I am losing hope in this guy.",2024-10-04
@happyguy The IAM made major concessions during the last contract.Most of Boeing problems today are due to poor managementdecisions over the past 10 years.Boeing needs to start building and delivering new 737 Maxx.Its their only way to trend toward some sort of positive free cash flows in the future.Ortberg needs to talk to his BOD and bring this strike toan end.  It will cost Boeing but not as much as halting production longer into October.The fate of Boeing has been in the hands of its top management.The IAM should be allowed to regain some/all of the lost benefitsand wages.  Boeing has tremendous customer demand. No reason other than poor management that Boeing finds itself in the weak position it is in today.Large shareholders and institutionals are to blame for allowingthe recent top management to destroy this company's operatingand financial condition...they blndly allowed the past dozen CEOsto ruin this firm.   A bankruptcy might be justice for these.Wall Street lemmings.,2024-10-04
@RCCH I do not feel that Boeing management has taken the correct stance in the past 10 years.Look at the stock price for proof.,2024-10-04

"@CR Spencer to be fair, Aurora is a subsidiary.Aurora is known for drones and adding automated flight to existing aircraft.Aurora has never designed a full sized aircraft, nor one that carries passengers.Virgin Galactic was desperate to find anyone to take on the task with the cost and timeframes.I suspect that they were attempting to reverse engineer WK2. What is telling about this issue is that for a year, VG continued to claim the work was ""on target"" Then in the lawsuit, it is detailled work stopped 13 months prior.Just like attempting to reverse engineer SS3...Its only a matter of time before VG is forced to actually reveal the progress on Delta, other than 'on target""",2024-10-04
"It's so easy to kick someone when they're down. Especially when they deserve it! Full disclosure; I lost a whole lot of money owning SPCE, Virgin Galactic stock. Companies are in tough situations when they need to contract with their competitors to build their equipment. Of course Boeing is now known for doing a poor job designing its 737 Max airliners and its Starlliner Space capsule. Perhaps they are just too addicted to costPlus contracts. We should all realize the dangers of having entrenched bureaucracies. Virgin Galactic one seemed to have a whole lot more potential but it's wrangling with Boeing  and the problems with its Mothership carrier have diminished it's reputation. Those problems certainly influenced its decision to sell a major assembly plant to RocketLabs.Good luck to all those buying SPCE stock these days, you are getting it at a much better price than I paid.",2024-10-04
