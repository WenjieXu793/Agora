@Kirk Spano In order to get back to better there may be some resistance but that bit of resistance is far better for the future than the destruction we are seeing now.,2024-10-02
@boris gudonov Every one of these investment firms have a list. Maybe they're pitching their book. They want you to buy the price up! ;-),2024-10-02
"@golfcat1 we ought to control the border, but, we ought to be issuing enough work visas and green cards to offset Boomer retirements. That requires millions of immigrants per year.",2024-10-01
Amgn will break loose 2 months from now when it announces the blockbuster test results of its obesity drug.  The stock will never again be in the low 300's.,2024-09-30
"@Leo Nelissen That was my kneejerk reaction too.  I own JNJ, but I don't own AMGN.",2024-09-30
@santlo It won't. Markets will tank if the weird guys take over. They are a threat to democracy and capitalism.,2024-09-30
"@BM Cashflow Detective Fantastic comment, thanks!""The stock is still good value based on its 5y forward PEGY ratio of 1.88 and could become really attractive again at the next significant drawdown.""",2024-09-30
"@ndardick Fingers crossed we get another correction to deploy some money :-)Btw, nice win for the Bears yesterday.",2024-09-30
"Amgen is a resilient marathon stock.That is the decisive advantage and that is exactly why you should like the company.And just because of that.But nothing less than that.Amgen has demonstrated consistent revenue growth, achieving a 20% year-over-year increase in Q2 2024, the highest quarterly revenue in its history, driven by a 26% volume growth.The company’s strategic investments in its late-stage pipeline and the successful integration of Horizon Therapeutics are expected to yield significant synergies and accretive earnings.Additionally, Amgen’s diverse portfolio, including innovative products like Blincyto and Kyprolis, and its strong performance in the rare disease segment, position it well for sustained growth.With a robust pipeline and strategic international expansion, Amgen is poised to maintain its trajectory of growth and innovation.Its Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 8.3% ranks in the 86.9% percentile for the sector.There is still room for further improvements here.The stock is still good value based on its 5y forward PEGY ratio of 1.88 and could become really attractive again at the next significant drawdown.Long $AMGNOpportunities come or go sooner or later.But most of the time they come!",2024-09-30
"Ironically, I took a fairly close look at both AMGN and GILD in between football games yesterday, and I was not excited by either. I do agree with you when you say: ""Although AMGN is far from spectacular, I consider it a great pick for conservative dividend growth portfolios, as it's a great sleep-well-at-night way to build income and wealth.""Despite the foregoing, I am only in the mood to buy compelling stories rather than merely decent or even appealing stories over the next six weeks. Art Cashin of UBS used to write annually about the old saw to ""Sell on Rosh Hashonah and buy on Yom Kippur."" Well, Rosh Hashonah starts on Wednesday. And then there's that U. S. Presidential election thing in 5 weeks.Plenty of time to revisit AMGN over that time span.",2024-09-30
"@AlphaSierra I appreciate your comment. I agree. Past underperformance is not a good sign. However, that was mainly driven by tech-fueled gains in the S&P 500. Given the valuation of the S&P 500, AMGN should be in a much better spot to outperform.",2024-09-30
"Good company but at the current stage it is historically highly valued which makes it unattractive to add for me.Despite the raise in multiples, the S&P 500 underperformance makes me a bit nervous.",2024-09-30
"@erbrown Don’t bet the farm on that. I don’t see cap gain tax on unrealized gains. For openers, evaluations are impossible, not only for the likes of farm land but also for 1000 shares of a publicly-traded stock, liquidity is a big deal. Then there’s the velue of the local family business. Not so fast.",2024-09-29
@Senopta Yes I would buy BRKR.I do not know much about MEDP. I will look into this one.,2024-09-29
Stock Market at record levels under Biden-Harris …why will change  to Trump be better for market?,2024-09-29
"@Jimghad Ok. Nothing what fits into my strategy, despite BSX, but not at current level. Any thoughts about BRKR or MEDP?",2024-09-28
"@Senopta  AMGN, SNY, PFE, MRK ( if the study for the oral Cholesterol PCSK- 9 inhibitor is positive MRK will grow by 30% , if this phase 3 study is not positive I will get out of MRK )  AZ and BSX.While LLY pipeline is excellent, the share prices are way ahead of themselves. BMY has a very good new  drug for Schizophrenia, the price of the drug is too high. So I do not hold it.My key focus for the Cos. I own is the pipeline in Phase 3 and under registration. I do not pay any attention to pipeline in Phase 2.",2024-09-28
Amgen has a GREAT pipeline that will pay off handsomely.  Buy now at these low stock values.,2024-09-28
@Pmg1959 It will engineer better results than that.  Its a bellwether in biotech.  Sort of a must to have in your portfolio so it will always trade at an elevated valuation.  Sort of like Apple.  Its PE makes no sense but then it does when you look at non-financial factors.,2024-09-27
"@The Real Cavalier 4% revenue growth through 2033 is essentially flat, inflation adjusted. There must be better investments.",2024-09-27
