"Seems as if you have an appropriately balanced perspective on AVGO, which I do like very much. Most analysts also like AVGO very much, and have price targets significantly higher than its current market price. Yet, it is not cheap, is highly volatile based on the particular day's sentiments regarding AI and chips, and thus I am actively taking advantage of its wide range of price fluctuations by trading aggressively and frequently around our core position in AVGO, which is currently tied with GOOG and EPD for our second largest holding in a portfolio of 29 stocks.AVGO should be owned at its current price of $176. AVGO shoujld be bought more aggressively at lower prices, especially if it declines again to the $138-143 range as it did recently. And AVGO should be trimmed when it gets up into and above the $185-$200 range.",2024-10-06
"You should look into the sentiment of the customers of companies they have purchased. You will not be as bullish after that. IMHO they will do well in the next three years as they lock customers into deals.  After that customers will realize there are other, better, more cost effective options out there and they will stop using their software products. After 3 years they will start to lose a large share of their existing customer base who at that point are merely subscribers.",2024-10-06
