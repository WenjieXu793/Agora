"@Quipus Capital Nice write up again.SPWH appears to be a speculative play, mainly due to its high debt levels. However, the appointment of a new CEO, notable insider buying, and the strategic position taken by Stone House suggest a potential turnaround. When we examine key metrics—price-to-sales (P/S) at 9%, price-to-tangible-book (P/TB) at 47%, and the stock trading at just 1.91 times free cash flow (FCF)—SPWH looks significantly undervalued, making it an intriguing opportunity for those willing to take on some risk.",2024-10-06
"@rjm22 I'm more impressed with Stone House announcing a 5% stake on Sept 17th. CEO has taken an additional 60,000 share stake in last few weeks amounting to about a $150,000 investment. Stone House, on the other hand, purchased 1.9 million shares- far more meaningful. Stone House is an extremely focused investor, owning only 3 or 4 stocks at a time. It has owned LNW, Light & Wonder for at least 6 years. It is by far it's biggest investment over the years. it is up about 900% since 2018. That is impressive. Stone House had approximately $100 million invested 6 years ago. Now approaching $300 million. It is nice to see a successful investment fund and management step up and show interest at current stock price.",2024-10-05

"@rjm22 -  I'm beginning to wonder if this is tax-loss selling by a large fund rather than any other potential weakness. I sold about 10k shares at around $2.90 and am gradually buying back 2,500 shares at a time.",2024-10-02

@caseyjames I apparently never answered your point here. I suspect some if not many of their locations would be wanted by others such that their long term lease liabilities are overstated.I am not saying they will thrive or go bankrupt. Just that they could dispose of many of their leases for less than the remaining term.The fact that I am concerned about their long term viability seems to argue against me owning the stock. But I do.,2024-10-01
@rjm22 I just bought a fishing pole at the Wausau store today….$122.  Was going to buy some shotgun shells too but didn’t have what I wanted.  The store was decently busy for 9:30am on a Tuesday.,2024-10-01
"I did not sell any on the run over $3 but it seems I should have now that it's back to $2.55.Was hoping we might see some other directors buy more. Looking back I show 4 insiders bought last Oct. So their window may still be open?I lack confidence in their business long term. Hopefully they can sell out or downsize over time in a way that does not bankrupt them.Does anyone need or want to buy the company?  Hopefully if they need to downsize they will be able to close stores without huge hits to the balance sheet.Decades ago I took a very large position in a retailer that I knew would not make it. But my estimates of the worst case scenario were too optimistic. While they did not take huge hits to inventory during liquidation sales, their operating losses were larger than I expected during the liquidation.I made money in the end. Just not as much as I hoped for or expected.",2024-10-01

(NASDAQ:SPWH) should definitely note that the President, Paul Stone, recently paid US$2.54 per share to buy US$101k worth of the stock. We reckon that's a good sign, especially since the purchase boosted their holding by 798%.---------------GuruFocus via yahoo says:On September 9, 2024, Paul Stone, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SPWH), purchased 39,920 shares of the company, according to a recent SEC Filing. Following this transaction, the insider now owns a total of 904,157 shares of the company.----------Where did they get 798%?  He apparently directly owned 5000 shares prior to his buy. 39,920/5000=798%. And they are disregarding all his restricted shares.He did not buy the 5000 in the open market. Or maybe he did before he got the job in which case it would not be reportable.Here are Stones vestings which total 859,237 shares if my math is right.He stands to make $4.3 million over 3 years if the stock goes to $5.2. Includes (i) 330,097 restricted stock units scheduled to vest in three substantially equal installments on November 1, 2024, November 1, 2025 and November 1, 2026, (ii) 404,530 restricted stock units scheduled to vest in three substantially equal installments on April 1, 2025, April 1, 2026 and April 1, 2027 and (iii) 124,610 restricted stock units scheduled to vest in three substantially equal installments on May 1, 2025, May 1, 2026, and May 1, 2027, in each case, subject to the Reporting Person's continued employment with the Issuer.

"@rjm22 If liquidation or bankruptcy is a going concern which it is (why it trades so cheap) than tangible book value is relevant. Should that happen, the leases are pure liabilities to common shareholders.

@Rodney Beasley  The form 4 does show ownership of 904k shares and this was his first open market buy. Meaning he has restricted shares of some 864k shares.Probably vested over a few years and perhaps performance based. So it's not like he was given all those shares the day he signed. Hopefully the upcoming rate cuts will help consumers to spend at SPWH. One tomorrow or wed and another inNov.,2024-09-16
