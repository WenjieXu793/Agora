"@Gary J. Gordon You are right on some of your longs, and I follow you. You were right on MTG.",2024-10-04
"@deadandburied I have stopped writing for SA because I got so little interest in my long ideas (but thanks for your interest and I'm glad you made money!).  You are right that it hit my price target, and I can't argue for a big upside from here.  But I'm holding on personally because I don't see a material downside unless the US hits a material recession.  In the meantime, MTG will keep aggressively buying back stock, and at some point national mortgage debt will start actively growing again.Best of luck.",2024-10-02
"Time for an update now that the Fed is lowering rates? Bought this after reading your Nov'23 analysis @18, and at that time you were looking for 25, which is generally where it's trading now (Sep'24). Thanks for that!",2024-10-01
