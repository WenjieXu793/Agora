"@kata I believe it is the patent rules. There were comments that if pharma tried to collect on new drugs sent to  other countries as they do in the US, then those other countries would just replicate the drug.",2024-10-03
@kata I understand completely why and would agree that research costs a lot but why are other countries paying far less ...even out of the gate on new drugs? We know these high priced drugs medicare keeps buying comes straight from taxes on Americans. Completely unfair,2024-10-02
@blenkep Wrong again. Forced government price controls absolutely do increase investor risk. Lower earnings places the dividend in jeopardy which is often the reason why investors buy the stock. When a company cuts or eliminates its dividend the stock price often tanks as well so it is a double whammy.,2024-10-02
"@GETRICHSLOW2 since England, Canada,China and the EU all negotiate prices already and pharma has no problem attracting capital speaks volumes. Reducing prices on several drugs will not increase investor risk.",2024-10-02
"@secorewb Isn't it wonderful to not need insulin injections? That's what innovation does to make life better. Unfortunately, innovation will be going away with government price controls.",2024-10-02
"@BeaBaggage The $2000 out-of-pocket cost cap is absolute. There is no donut hole. Sounds wonderful on the surface but have you seen your mom's new part D insurance premium yet? You might want to sit down before opening that envelope. Also, have you given any thought at all as to who is going to pay for all the yearly costs above $2000? They don't just vanish into thin air as democrats would like for us to believe.",2024-10-02
"@CMPMD What other healthcare companies often have to do to stay alive is the result of Medicare. Not the other way around. For example, the new $2000 per year cap on Part D out-of-pocket costs is forcing insurance companies to raise their premiums in a big way.",2024-10-02
"@D_DAYTRADER For whatever reason, investors like the stock. That is what drives market capitalization. Doesn't always correlate to revenue.",2024-10-02
@blenkep Without investor capital there would be no highly technical drug invention companies. Without a fair return for risking their capital there would be no investor capital. Most big pharma dividend yields are <5%. Do you loan/risk your money for free?,2024-10-02
@Callitlikeitis name a big pharma that invested more in R&D than they paid out in dividends and share repurchases.,2024-10-01
"@GETRICHSLOW2 They ll just steal their patents, Kamala says “she has the will”",2024-10-01
"@kata I think R&D is the last thing they would cut. New drugs are tomorrow's profits. Every time a patent expires, they need something new to take its place and continue bringing in the big bucks.",2024-10-01
@GETRICHSLOW2 I am an actual lawyer. The government absolutely does have a case. The real question is whether this Supreme Court will rule based on politics rather than legal precedent.,2024-09-30
"@Dichristensen There you go. You didn't think you was getting anything for free, did you? Good luck finding another plan because they will all be raising premiums thanks to Harris' ignorance.",2024-09-30
@the dogman There will be many lawsuits to play out and the government has no case whatsoever.,2024-09-30
"@The Value Portfolio Did you read the article? Any company refusing the price controls will be extorted by facing a federal excise tax up to 1900% of ALL SALES of that drug. Not just Medicare sales. In other words, we will use the federal government tyranny to destroy your company. That is what Harris calls ""Negotiating'.",2024-09-30
"@Rhoda711 yes I read that, so you and other citizens will be paying more. No free govt money.",2024-09-29
@GETRICHSLOW2 Stealing private property != making Medicare negotiate. Any drug company is welcome not to submit to negotiations and not have their drugs be available for Medicare.,2024-09-29
@GETRICHSLOW2 by your standards then taxes would be included in constitutional violation.,2024-09-29
"@William Frey Glad to hear you got better and had a Medigap plan that would pay for it.  80 days!  (Surprised you didn't die of boredom...)  Sounds like you had a long journey, you must be so relieved.  Glad you're better.Sorry to hear about your pre-existings, Pmg 1959  It used to be a lot worse before the Affordable Care Act, ""Obama Care"".Unfortunately, Medicare Advantage plans are like having an HMO where the insurance co. tells you which doctors you can see, which hospitals you can use, and how long you can stay...if you want them to cover it.  Having a medigap plan is like having a PPO where you can go to any doctor or facility that accepts Medicare.  I recommend Medigap over an Advantage plan, if it's at all possible for you.",2024-09-29
