I sold my D investment earlier this year and bought ENB that has a higher and safe growing dividend (not frozen) and owns D's former most valuable money-making pipeline assets.   I'm in a much better investment position with ENB!,2024-10-01
@OnWi don't matter if you sold over $80 if you also bought over $80.,2024-09-30
Where were you when I was buying this in the $30s?,2024-09-30
@stupidguy2023 Glad I sold over $80!! It’s all a matter of timing with most stocks hey.,2024-09-30
Glad I was buying in the low $40s. Next i look shares are north of $55. Nice.,2024-09-30
"@Jamjack - lol, I never said otherwise. What a sophomoric response ... it's right up there with ""we need CO2 to live"" or ""climate is cyclical"". No one (certainly not me...) ever said otherwise.Meantime, the reality is that Florida homeowners can't afford home insurance (even if they are lucky enough to find it ..) and beach-houses in North Carolina continue to fall into the ocean:www.youtube.com/...So, you may agree with trump and his non-science backed assertion that global warming is a ""hoax"", but you are paying for it anyway - with your car and home insurance, and indirectly with Federal debt due to massive (off-budget ...) increases in natural disaster ""recovery"" fund:www.cbo.gov/...So you can look in the review mirror at Spanish treasury ships (seriously? lol), but I'm an engineer that prefers to look at modern day science, facts, and statistics. And I have no time for nonsense. MUTE!",2024-09-26
@Bulldog67 Thanks for sharing those comments.  It's also notable that Dominion sold about half the CVOW project to third party.  That generates significant cash flow and lays off a big chunk of the any risk associated with the project.,2024-09-16
"@user anita i did roughly the same trade/swap :)  DUK is now about 12% of my very concentrated portfolio...while Leo nicely points out some of D's upsides, i am going to hold my DUK and avoid D...",2024-09-14
"@jimoc Indeed, if an investor doesn't follow the business, nor understand the business and its changing backdrop, then insists upon a ""buy and forget"" strategy .... they are likely to experience poor returns.  You snooze, you lose.  You own your investment decisions.",2024-09-11
"@Ray Merola While many people will disagree with this statement, ET’s management team, including KW, is light years ahead of the management team at D.  I have a huge position in ET (owned a lot of ET and also CEPQ which they bought) because I believe in management.  I have $0 invested in D, because I do NOT believe management is running the company to maximize shareholder returns!ET is selling at a fraction of the price of D, has a much higher growth potential, and a higher tax deferred yield than that of D.",2024-09-11
"@Ray Merola The current management has gone woke and sold off the higher growth business of natural gas, as well as almost giving away the Cove Point LNG export plant to Warren Buffett (Buffett seems to understand ROIC much better than the senior management of D)!Management then made the decision to invest $billions in an offshore wind farm, that may or may not prove to be successful.  I believe some offshore wind farms have actually been shut down off the MA & NY coasts due to higher than expected costs and construction problems.  So IMHO, as well as the opinion of many other investors in D’s hometown on Richmond, current management has “bet the farm (company)” on clean offshore wind farms!  Given Blue’s background prior to joining D, I am not surprised he has ditched fossil fuels and bet on “green energy”.  In the long run, those decisions will have a negative impact on D shareholders!Also I find it very difficult to pay 17-19 times earnings for a slow growing utility stock.  There are too many better opportunities out there in which to invest my limited capital.",2024-09-11
"@jimoc That's generally false, at least in the utility sector.  Selling D stock above $80 and repurchasing in the low $40s provided total returns that haven't been exceeded by many other public utilities.Over the past year or so, Dominion stock has met or beat the XLU while providing investors with a superior dividend yield; between 5.5 percent and 6 percent depending upon when an investor accumulated the position.",2024-09-11
"@jimoc That news was from several years ago.  Management was unable to fulfill the expected 6% annual dividend increase and explained why.  However, certain retail investors were traumatized by that.  They missed out on the subsequent capital appreciation and high dividend yield.  Unfortunately, that happens; particularly to investors who do not follow the business and / or management commentary closely.I write about other equities that cut the dividend (distribution).  For example, Energy Transfer (ET) cut the cash distribution four years ago.  The stock tripled since then and the distribution is higher than before the cut.  Yet, there are still investors out there that continue to argue the company is no good and management cannot be trusted because of a 2020 distribution cut.  Same old story.",2024-09-11
@Ray Merola and raise their dividend 6% a year. Which they haven’t done.,2024-09-11
"@jimoc That's a poor characterization of what happened.  The VA legislature passed legislation that requires regulated utilities to make a move towards alternative energy generation. Dominion management elected to follow the ball.  As a regulated utility, such projects do not take on undue risk.  As with all regulated projects, there are stipulated returns and construction sideboards; reviewed and approved by the SCC regulators.If a large, regulated utility thumbs their nose at the State (who appoints the regulators) I bet you're smart enough to know how that's likely to turn out.Apparently, certain investors mixed their politics with their investments and may have missed out on an excellent opportunity for capital appreciation and locking in a high dividend yield by accumulating D stock.  Remarks in the comment section of several articles I wrote indicated some investors confused CVOW politics and their real objective: generate alpha.As noted in my articles, I don't care if a regulated utility generates power using hamsters in treadmills.  If the project returns and terms are stipulated by the state, largely laying off the risk upon the ratepayers, the underlying investment premise remains sound.  Dominion offered investors an opportunity to make good money on a stock that was in part shunned due to some retail investors personal politics.",2024-09-11
"@user anita If you sold upon the late CEO Farrell's departure and dividend cut announcement, the price was in the low $80s.  Selling shares around that price range went on through most of 2021.  D shares could have been repurchased below $45 between October 2023 and April 2024 during a period of peak pessimism.  The poor sentiment was largely due to retail investors feeling burned by the previous dividend cut, major asset sales, and CVOW project.  However, all of these moves were telegraphed by new management in conjunction with their plans to restore the balance sheet, focus the business upon the regulated electric business in VA / SC, reduce costs, and announce CVOW as aligned with the regulatory legislation passed by the Commonwealth.    It was true utilities used to be for ""widows and orphans.""  However, over the last couple of decades, many ute management teams elected to get into unregulated power generation and transmission projects.  Some got in over their heads.  Dominion was among these companies; however, current management reversed course and returned to Dominion's regulated electric roots.Over the past ~25 years, the only utility stocks I purchased were those that stuck to or were transitioning back to regulated utility distribution.",2024-09-11
"@Ray Merola essentially, if your timing was perfect, D was a somewhat better performer.  However, if you already owned D, as I did, and didn’t sell,as I did, it was a horrible performer.  They used to say utilities were for widows and orphans (safe). That doesn’t seem to be the case any more.",2024-09-11
@Mike-SC but they plan to raise the slashed dividend 6% a year and they’ve done it once in four.80 to where it is now and failure to raise as stated.,2024-09-10
"SO is the only individual utility I own .. which is in my dividend tranche. After verifying that D was NOT in the top ten holdings of UTG, I recently opened a starting position in UTG. Having a statement like ""management affirms"" in the same article as Dominion is meaningless to me, as they have about as much credibility as Richard Kinder or WPCs management in my eyes. Others will beg to differ.",2024-09-10
