"@Stephen Simpson Yeah, makes sense. Your work is top notch but it is often not on the usual tickers that others may follow so can see it not being fruitful for you.",2024-08-28
"@Guraaf I track PCAR, WSO, APD, and DE but only write on them occasionally (the economics rarely work).",2024-08-28
"@Stephen Simpson Doing good. In watch mode. My favorite stock has always been $PH. I sold my $ETN too early and not ready to buy again at current price. I have held $ATKCY now for more than 7 years, I think. And $LECO, I like them too.I don't own other industrials (do have $LMT but more defense and $UNP which is railroads). Monitoring $IEX $ITT $IR #ALLE.Do you track $PCAR $UFPI $WSO $APD $DE? They appear to be less over-priced. I will look at $CMCO tonight. Thanks.",2024-08-28
@Guraaf Take a look at CMCO. Valuation isn't ridiculous. RRX and EMR worth a look here too. And good to hear from you again! Hope you're well.,2024-08-28
