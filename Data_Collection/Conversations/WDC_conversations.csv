"I owned WDC for more than 10 yrs and i think you are spot on. My plan is also to hold at this level and sell opportunistically at much higher price. And in the meantime, dabble into Micron which i hv never owned before.",2024-10-03
"Afaik HDD's are at a technological bottleneck. They cant increase bit-density any further unless they finally get that heat/microwave based write/read tech going and even then, the uplift will only keep them around for 2 more generations or so due to physically running out of space on the platters.Meanwhile ssd's do not have this issue and will continue to cheapen in $/tb. The performance difference stopped being even remotely comparable a decade ago as well.Call me crazy but imo Seagate and now WD are digging their own grave not participating in the clearly vastly superior technology.And the superior technology will be the superior market as well. It is inevitable.HDD's may have a use now, but thats solely based on being cheaper. Not exactly a high margin buisness you wanna be in when your products only reason for existing is that the better version is more expensive and thats on a timer.All of the above is why I invested in Micron when considering the constantly growing storage demand due to AI and other technological trends and it has done very well for me.I intend to continue sticking with them for my storage needs, altough I may build a NAS with WD Red's in the future but even that'll have some crucial ssd's for cache, so 50/50 hdd/ssd I guess.",2024-09-28
"@Chris Lau APP, PEGA, and GPN, in that order, seem really interesting.  TY!",2024-09-13

"I think huge increase in electricity consumption because of AI is flat out wrong with instead the exact opposite be true. No one actually knows what The AI even is so crazy capable and powerful handsets starting with from Apple being rolled out which actually is adding to generating capacity in the United States where said battery improvements will presumably continue to spread into solar powered remote off grid systems and of course battery electric cars further *""distributing""* power adding to an already massive ""electron glut"" into upon the USA that like oil is also materially building going into Year end 2024.

"@Pingili I'm not saying but today. in fact, I'm adding to bonds at this moment. but I have 4 off this list and will add as I deem appropriate. ddog I got for $80 and will add more shares at some point.",2024-09-10
"Good ideas and theory on this press release, but way too much research for this ancient investor. Anyone have recommendations if there is/are mid-cap tech ETFs or CEFs to look at? I'd be happy to get decent performance with diversified tech risk from a mid cap fund.",2024-09-10
"I actually see quite a few solid companies here with share prices that should appreciate considerably, if not immediately. Some names I don't recognize and a few I find questionable but overall not a bad list to generate some ideas for further research.Mid-caps are something my portfolio needs desparately and I would like to open ~5 positions in a few new stocks over the coming weeks (usually 1/4th to 1/3rd the size of what I consider a full position). I'd like at least 3 to be mid-caps. I'm really eyeing TER, but my portfolio is already considerably overweight in the semiconductor industry.",2024-09-10
