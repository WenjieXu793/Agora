"Having read the company's SEC filing on this matter, it seems to be a case of ""pushing the spinach around the plate,"" rather than a significant financial issue. The amount of revenue recognized under the contract modification ($17.3 million) did not change; it was just recognized in multiple quarters, rather than upon receipt. Cash flow obviously did not change....the company received $17.3 million regardless of when the revenue was recognized. The amount involved was less than 5% of total revenues for the fiscal years involved (2023 and 2024).DISCLOSURE: I have no position in RGEN.",2024-09-18
