"@QElonKingTwit It's the same in Germany. A lot of different brands, one national internet star released a product in the category at the same price point at which Monster sits. Monster still has by far the most shelf space.",2024-09-30
@Seattle_Engineer  As I suspected.  SA can't be bothered to provide the actual three decimal amounts involved.  Very misleading not to mention ridiculous.  RSR,2024-09-12
Check your math SA. I get a .02 increase from .21 coming out to 9.5%.  Is there some rounding of the dividend amounts going on that's not shown here? How do you get only 7%?  RSR,2024-09-12
