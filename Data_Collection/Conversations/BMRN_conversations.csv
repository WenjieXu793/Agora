Sounds close to a generic Kuvan - what's different about RLFTF's drug if they both have the same active ingredient and  peak/total exposure levels are the same?,2024-10-04

I wonder what is ASND's plan to obtain freedom to operate over biomarin's patent RE48267 (www.freepatentsonline.com/...)? This patent expressly claims the protein sequence of CNP-38 linked to a synthetic polymeric group such as polyethylene glycol.  ASND's  Transcon CNP is CNP-38 linked to polyethylene glycol.  I doubt Biomarin  will let them market this drug without a hefty license.,2024-09-18
thanks for such a neat article. I agree that BMRN is undervalued right now and it is a good buying opportunity.,2024-09-18
"I  see that Biomarin’s reissue patent (RE48267) expressly claims “a synthetic polymeric group"" coupled to a CNP, wherein the CNP is “CNP-38”, “SEQ ID NO 160” (claim 15), “wherein the synthetic polymeric group comprises a hydrophilic polymeric moiety” (claim 16), “wherein the hydrophilic polymeric moiety comprises polyethylene glycol (PEG) (claim 17).  Claims 18, 21, 22, 23, 27, 32 also specifically claim “CNP-38”, “SEQ ID NO 160”. Ascendis’s drug (TransCon CNP) is CNP-38 coupled to PEG (polyethylene glycol) .This was a reissue patent in which biomarin specifically amended the already-issued patent to claim CNP-38.  During the examination, Ascendis filed a third party protest asserting that biomarin should not be able to recapture non-elected subject matter  but biomarin still ended up getting the an issuance.Right now, Ascendis use of cnp-38 falls under the research exemption, so there is not yet patent infringement. I'll be interested to see how biomarin and ascendis handle this",2024-09-18
"@presikakid yes, it does not look good to me. The results were better from the Danish company. I am not an expert, just if this is the main thing, I am not rushing buying Biomarin",2024-09-17
"@Zelenka fear of competitive pressure on Voxzogo from a new drug.   If true, what’s left given Roctavian sad launch?   Lots of brokers rushed ratings downgrades.",2024-09-17
I have read also somewhere that bmrn has filed a claim against asnd regarding patent infringement about this drug. Not sure if the details of this is true,2024-09-17
@HOBcastle Ascendis rises on positive trial data for dwarfism therapy. Competition. Not sure if the reaction is an opportunity,2024-09-16
@heshar competitor to voxzogo had promising results also it would be a once a week treatment vs daily treatment. Kind of a big deal especially since BMRN management stated during their investor day that they want to make voxzogo the centerpiece of its growth strategy.,2024-09-16
