Take a look at CAPR….this will make this discussion much easier …..,2024-09-27
"Thank you for sharing, I would also consider  WAVE Life science (WVE) as a potential emerging competitor. They just announced best in class results in DMD and intend to pivot to other EXON Skipping indications. While their drug is earlier in development, and the company is a micro company, their data is  compelling in the DMD space.",2024-09-27
"@1980bklyn Why I am playing it via covered calls, as I can make money even if the stock trades sideways.  Best",2024-09-27
"@1980bklyn Price you mention isn't the stock's, but the drug's. Of course, it is an issue. Especially that there isn't any warranty regarding how long it works.",2024-09-26
"Thanks for the write up Bret.  Am long this for several years but frustrated by the price action given the $3 to $4 B in revenue projection for next year .  Stock is trading where it was before approval.  Last ER had multiple question on ""bottleneck"" issues for administrating the drug.  Also I wonder if it's the $3.2 mm price tag on the stock that makes it a target for DC or the insurance companies push back.  Any thoughts?",2024-09-26
@Flash9875 I don't need to update the FDA. It knows. Why do you think it didn't let the company file the BLA?,2024-09-25
@Out_on_a_limb plenty of believers….see todays 10 million shares traded and 50% gain. Mr broken limb capr is being mentioned here for the same reasons SRpt is mentioned ina capr article …. seekingalpha.com/...      An educated person would want a full lay of the land….,2024-09-24
"@Biotech Pharma Investor HOPE uses natural history as a comparator arm. We don't know precisely what data is extracted, but it is clearly skewed. We know because the PR says: ""there are currently no approved therapies for DMD cardiomyopathy"", which is incorrect to say the least.SOC is ACE Inhibitors, plus Beta-Blockers at a later stage. These drugs are even more efficient when used as prophylaxis (before imaging reveals heart damage). So deramiocel is simply not compared to the latter drugs.",2024-09-24
"@Biotech Pharma Investor SOC is NOT steroids alone vs. dilated cardiomyopathy. One must include ACE Inhibitors and Beta-Blockers to be SOC. This study is bunk, but will deliver positive results. Because deramiocel is better than nothing for the heart. This is a shame for DMD patients, they deserve better.",2024-09-24
@Biotech Pharma Investor New deflazacort  CEO can't write down the name: vamorolone or Agamree. Not going to change the results.Not potency asset but potency assay. All these years to understand this basic concept? Exosome is an important technology. It can replace the viral capsid which triggers immune response. And capsid is too small for DMD gene therapy.,2024-09-24
Jeepers…you missed the most obvious ….CAPR …..the stuff actually works and is about 1/3 the price of SRpt. Spend a few mins to research. Capr is the sleeper coming to life in the dmd space. And while one could look at it as a competitor….it actually complements SRpt. SRpt could save their bacon by acquiring capr. Would appreciate your thoughts on this.,2024-09-19
"I have mixed feelings about Elevydis data, so am a little cautious about the commercial rollout. Looking forward to seeing data from RGX-202. (Long RGNX.)",2024-09-11
