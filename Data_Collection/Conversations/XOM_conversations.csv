"@ndardick Thanks for highlighting the opportunities across the energy sector, and the midstream companies exposure make good financial sense! Hopefully XOM does get some solid pullback to improve its valuation!",2024-10-06
@Orion1963 Thanks for the added insights and commentary! Great company to buy on dips!,2024-10-06
@Valuestocks007 Staying the course on energy stocks make sense as they gush cash flow.,2024-10-06
XOM is my personal dividend aristocrat for holding the dividend through the neg front month oil/covid hysteria era.,2024-10-06
@Transformation64 You are correct about the dividend increase as they are due the next time they announce as the last one was the 4th payment.Hopefully they will do so.  As far as guessing the amount I never guess as I have no control and if I miss than I could be disappointed.,2024-10-06
"@G1949 The current buy back per year is 20 billion.  That is great, but, as always, relative.  I think the Pioneer acquisition added 550 million shares.  So, it will take a while.  But, we have not seen the full effect of the integrated Pioneer acquisition.  We saw some of it last quarter and will get a better view this quarter and then in ? December ? their annual report.  Right now all is strong, except for natural gas.  Hopefully that becomes more profitable and they can bump the buyback rate to 25 billion shares.At that rate, we d get down to 4 billion even in 2 years, or so.  I think the dividend really gets interesting in about 2 years, assuming LNG is better and we have a clearer picture on Pioneer and if the world econmy gets moving",2024-10-06
@Orion1963 Excellent points on oil demand in China.  Will demand slow and plateau or actually decline in the near future?  The rest of the developing world will replace the slow growth in China.,2024-10-06
@jonesdl261 KMI is on a tear lately. I may sell my limited exposure in advance of its earnings report later this month.,2024-10-06
"@Zvi Bar I have also looked at ET, but years ago I was burned when KMI converted to a c-corp.  from a tax perspective and decided too never again own an MLP and of course since KMI caused it I decided never to again own KMI. Some people call that episode KINDERED so I sort of feel that way.All that being said I never tell other where or how to invest, but will always share what I do Wishing you the best.",2024-10-06
Unbelievable. Just about every other stock in the oil and gas sector has been hammered.,2024-10-06
dividend safe and may increase?  the dividend is the one area that capex; permian purchase; share increases; causing a laggard and severe compared to CVX dividend increases.  $4.00 needs to be bare minimum,2024-10-06
@Jlexus1953 xom has been doing buybacks to reduce float after Pxd acquisition. Once they buy back enough shares they’ll start to hike the dividend substantially. Guyana is just getting started. Production will keep increasing every quarter over there.,2024-10-06
XOM is at the top of its range. No reason to buy at this point. A better buy would be BP. Since 2019 its enterprise value has dropped 40% despite earnings being approximately the same. PBR.A. would also be a better buy since the dividend yield is much higher and its PE is about a third of Exxons.,2024-10-06
"I’m not smart enough or dumb enough to try to time the market, especially individual stocks. Find companies that I feel are well managed, needed, high quality and that I can feel comfortable and confident about holding long term. XOM easily fits that description for me.",2024-10-06
@ndardick I agree long DVN EQT EPD KMI ET I am only down on DVN but with Matterhorn pipelines opening up that will help profitability,2024-10-06
"Maintaining overweight status in energy, long XOM AM KMI OKE FANG, all bought post-Covid at very attractive prices.",2024-10-06
Own Exxon for 10++ years with reinvested dividends. It is one of the mega giant oil companies and has exceptional management.The balance sheet is in excellent position and the concentrations on Guyana and the Permian Basin will provide growing amounts of low cost oil for many years to come.The Pioneer acquisition was fortunate adding to reserves and increasing output immediately making it accretive to earnings despite adding 550 million shares to the tally.Dividend is a bit disappointing and I do not expect more than 3 cents per share per quarter increase as management continues to concentrate on buybacks to offset the financial burden of the dividend.That said oil is cyclical and breached $100 when oil was over $100 which I don’t foresee repeating barring a catastrophic escalation of massive proportion in the Middle East or in Russia.Earnings forecast of just under $2.00 puts next years earnings around $8 so $140 stock price equates to 17.5x earnings which is unusually high for oil.If price did hit $140 I would explore cash out and wait until prices redeemed,2024-10-06
Remember everyone saying sell this one during covid!! Thank god I just stayed the course and keep collecting my dividends! Thanks XOM!,2024-10-06
"As you mentioned, XOM is the only oil company that held up well given the record net shorts on the oil futures contract these last few months. The record short position of this last month (by the big boys) never made any sense to me:1. Oil in storage was at near record lows.2. U.S. fracking oil production since 2014, is the source of over 80% of all new oil brought to the world market. All tight-rock basins except the 11 counties in the Permian have plateaued or declined. And, U.S. production has been stuck at 13.3 for many months. I.e. the big increase in U.S. oil production predicted by the EIA has not, and will not, materialize.3. Global consumption continues to rise.Thus, the record paper short on oil was 'odd' to say the least. And, as I've mentioned often, oil price was a coiled spring due to unwind; thus causing massive short covering by the traders. This had to happen with or without the Middle East excitement. Personally, given simple supply/demand dynamics, I would not expect much/if any pull back to oil price. Given the tension in the M.E., there is obvious upside to oil price. XOM is, I.M.H.O., the best run oil company with the best management team on the planet. Mr. Woods, for my money, is the best C.E.O. of any global corporation, not limited to oil equities. Long: XOM, WES, AM, EPD, ET.",2024-10-06
"Thanks for this excellent, well-balanced article on XOM. I am on the sidelines on XOM now, after selling it previously for $119. I redeployed the proceeds into other energy names that I believed had higher dividend yields and superior appreciation potential. At the moment, I have full positions in CVX and DVN, with a half position in PR for exposure to the Permian Basin. Admittedly, XOM has out-performed all of them over a one month, 3 month, 6 month, or year to date time period.Obviously all of these stocks are highly positively correlated in price with each other, and also highly positively correlated with the price of the underlying commodities that they produce and sell.One of the most important financial metrics that I look at to make investment decisions is the Price/Cash Flow ratio, which is currently 9.57 for XOM, 7.12 for CVX, 6.25 for PR, and 4.41 for DVN. Also, XOM sports the lowest dividend yield in the group.Another reason that I essentially flipped out of XOM and into CVX is because XOM has announced major initiatives to go green by developing, separately, both hydrogen and lithium programs that are going to be expensive and unlikely to produce meaningful revenues for years to come.Finally, I believe that energy is one of the last remaining sectors in which you can find stocks worthy of being purchased at their current prices for income, value and even growth. A wide variety of energy picks comprise more than 25% of the total portfolio of 29 stocks. Midstream pipeline MLPs EPD, ET and MPLX that anchor the energy holdings represent over 10% of total portfolio value. We also have a high conviction regarding the future of natural gas companies, with major bets on EXE (created last week when Chesapeake Energy merged with Southwestern Energy to create Expand Energy) and EOG.",2024-10-06
