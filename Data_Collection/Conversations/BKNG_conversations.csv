I missed the last dip. Now need to decide to wait for next next dip or pick up a few extra shares now,2024-09-25
"@ABC2030 Historically, recessions tend to follow about three months after the first rate cut, so the Eurozone should be nearing a recession by now. However, that's not the case at the moment. While growth is flat and minimal, I don't believe we're facing a recession just yet. In fact, I just doubled down today on LVMH, which has been hit hardby the poor sentiment.",2024-09-13
"@ABC2030 Waiting for recessions to buy stocks is a bad idea. Only my 2 cents of course. Nothing wrong in having some dry powder on the sidelines, but if it's too much, you will simply end up underperforming. The opportunity to buy this stock on the cheap was one month ago. I doubt we'll get another one anytime soon.",2024-09-13
"@Campounder Thank you for your update. That leaves for me to see the impact of the upcoming recession in the EU how that will impact booking and peers. I am pretty convinced we will get one of next order and will wait, booking simply at this valuation is not a no brainer swing for me as it lack enough margin of safety. Perhaps never as I doubt the long term strength of the moat. Will see.",2024-09-12
"@ABC2030 As I already pointed out in the comments section on another article, the impact is zero. How do I know it? The parity clauses have already been banned ages ago in most european countries. The new regulation makes zero difference in most countries. France and Sweden banned them in 2015, Germany and the UK in 2016, Italy in 2017. In my country, Switzerland, the parity clauses were banned in 2022.",2024-09-11
@Guraaf Sure the shareholders in Berkshire Hathaway are happy the stock never split look at the price,2024-09-10
"@ABC2030 Fair enough, thanks for reading! What valuation would be attractive for you?",2024-09-09
"@Millennial Dividends That is the whole point, Google AI or any small town or region ( collecting data) could do the same thing perhaps even better. Myrtle Beach will not need BKNG for golf trip whatsoever or Antalya in Turkey... At least that is what I am thinking...We will see the future very shortly.Good investing",2024-09-09
@Millennial Dividends Berkshire was also pure insanity. Warren Buffet caught up in old days when things were on paper and involved lot of logistics nightmare. Not with digital share holdings.,2024-09-09
