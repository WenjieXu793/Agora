"Is FCF really that bad?  When normalized to Enterprise Value (using Seeking Alpha info), it is 4.9%, which is similar to the 5.5% of Chevron and the 5.3% of Exxon Mobil, and is better than the 3.9% of Occidental Petroleum.",2024-09-25
"IMO, once we realize how broke the US is, NG will be accepted for the godsend it is.",2024-09-19
"My only concern with COP is that outside of their shale permian assets, the rest of their production is not so fast to start and stop and has higher capex , and this may be a detriment in a case where they have to start or stop oil production rapidly due to rapid geopolitical or oil price changes.",2024-09-17
"hey, I'm new!! now is the dip cause it dropped from 130+?",2024-09-17
Agreed.  I've been reinvesting my tbil divs here this summer.,2024-09-17
@Boomer11 they have a commercial trade desk. But yes they don’t hedge.,2024-09-13
@ding dong do you see oil stocks as a place to park cash other than money market? Problem is the volatility does not look very cash-like.,2024-09-12
""" The stocks do well after the capex announcements""That might have been true in a world where the demand for oil kept growing and supply tried to keep up. Now the demand is not growing as much and one day may start declining. I do not mind M&A in a declining industry as long it is not dilutive. Maintenance Capex is ok, but there is a point where more exploration Capex is detrimental (the only exception being new production that will reduce the cost/BOE.) COP needs to be very careful about it.",2024-09-12
"COP is better in a tough market than any other E&P peer. I am not even sure CVX is better. Probably not. I think COP is not expensive and capex is a good thing to expand. In fact, without capex spending in E&P, you will not outperform over time. COP also has virtually no leverage and quite good inventory. rrr ratio is respectable especially with the marathon deal.",2024-09-11
"@ding dong no no. if you look at long term history of E&P stocks, capital expenditures are what increases value over time. The stocks do well after the capex announcements - down the line. In fact, those that do not spend and grow are going to be left behind.",2024-09-11
"""The company is in the midst of an expensive acquisition that it's going through, and a decline in FCF could hurt its share buyback plans.""This does seem like a risk. They won't be able to buy back as much stock to remove the dilution.",2024-09-11
"At about a dollar upside to Marathon stock, this deal is sad indeed.",2024-09-10
"ConocoPhillips’ acquisition of Marathon Oil is expected to add over 2 billion barrels of resources to their portfolio  2 billion barrels of oil at the current price, we need the latest price per barrel. As of now, the price of crude oil is approximately $90 per barrel.This means the 2 billion barrels of oil would be worth around $180 billion . if half is cost to extract that leaves 90 billion.   ConocoPhillips is acquiring Marathon Oil in an all-stock transaction valued at $22.5 billion, which includes $5.4 billion in net debt/ total cost 27.9 billion And they get  90 billion dollars of oil and for every dollar on acquisition conocophillips  gets 3 dollars. source of info from copilot  sound good to meT",2024-09-10
Not a particular good read for a guy who owns MRO.,2024-09-09
"Speculative Africa Oil Co. is a strong buy... but, ConocoPhillips is a sell.  Alrighty then.  LOL.",2024-09-09
"I agree with you on COP not being a good long term holding. Personally, I like CNQ and EOG. Both are well-managed and have no problems with cash flow.",2024-09-09
