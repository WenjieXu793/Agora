"@Stone Fox Capital I agree.  People are not reading past the sensational headlines and so not understand how debt is restructured outside bankruptcy.  For sure, Spirit bit off too much debt with maturities way too far in to get the money to pay it off, but a lot of that debt goes into planes which it needs to put in service to make new money.",2024-10-04
"@markcc Right now, the BK threat appears a move to get the debtholders to make a deal, or else face years of time in court. As you say, Spirit has $1B in cash and tons of assets. The airline has no need to file for BK, other than not getting the debtholders to make an exchange for the $1.1B loan due in 2025.",2024-10-04
@jesjessie $JBLU is now up 16%. A $SAVE BK filing would only benefit the airline at the margin. Spirit Airlines isn't in such a dire situation to go out of business. Any move would just restructure the debt and might even make the airline stronger down the road with less debt.JetBlue seems to have run into strong resistance at $7.50.,2024-10-04
$8 is next for $JBLU. New 52 week high just got inked and shorts are feeling the mother of all short squeezes,2024-10-04
"@jesjessie Please read he whole WSJ article as it does not jump to any immediate filing for bankruptcy and focuses on negotiations with lenders under the possibility of BK that have to be completed in late October to meet credit card requirements.In the WSJ article, ""The timing of such a filing, should it happen, wouldn’t be imminent, they said.""   Remember that Spirit still has a billion in cash (end of Q2) and the big ""threat"" is that the credit card provider has to assure that Spirit is not going bankrupt as it would stick the credit card processors with giant claims if flights were not delivered.Using BK as a format for out of court negotiations, avoids an actual court filing that can take years.Of course, the stock moves in headlines, not details.I still am not in this turkey as my other non-airline positions are doing far superior.  I see the industry in an increasing margin squeeze that keeps getting worse.",2024-10-04
"@Mark Krieger i'm with u , so tired of seeing the stock chop around , its time for some serious new highs !",2024-10-04
rocketing up in premarket due to chapter 11 possible filing by $SAVE ...implies reduced competition. $7 by the bell?,2024-10-04
And there you have it.  Headed towards a probable bankruptcy.,2024-10-04
"@jesjessie selling off again into the open, i'm wondering if it might be time to step out as i'm seeing some better opportunities elsewhere , i had hoped we would see JBLU a lot higher by now testing the $9 to $12 range but it just keeps dragging its feet and sells off on every upward move , frustrating but a profit is a profit and sometimes ones better off just locking these in and walking while u're ahead !",2024-10-04
"@Mark Krieger the stock has favored neither bulls or bears for a long time now , both have been chopped up real good ..... u need a strong stomach to sit this one through",2024-09-30
"@Mark Krieger i figure from my calculations if a company came and made an offer to buy JBLU it would come in around $19 a share ; and admittedly my math could be wrong but i think i got it right ; however i agree with you we should see it test $7 and then around $8 this winter ; also all the technicals are screaming buy, all it needs is a bullish catalyst and JBLU will  see some serious upside.",2024-09-30
"@jesjessie not worth $19, but $8 is certainly possible by Christmas.",2024-09-30
"so fAR, THE LAST TWO WEEKS of trading has been a nightmare for shorts and a honeymoon for longs. One thing for sure, is you have to go with the trend and that has certainly been up recently. The stock has definitely found its mojo, whether it will continue is anyone's guess.",2024-09-30
"the FED just cut interest rates , this means Bull Market as rates are brought down to a 2% target level, Bull Market means companies get back on their feet and spend money which means everybody starts flying again ..... the entire airline sector has been beaten to a pulp and thats why the airline stocks are selling at a huge discount, JBLU will make money and run a profit as this is their publicly stated goal also the company is worth about $19 a share so there is lots of room for the bulls to run to the upside. Also most of the technical indicators are screaming buy the Bull run up.",2024-09-24
"heard Jim Crammer gave his 2 cents worth on the airlines , well thank the good Lord he did not endorse the airlines and Jetblue cause i'd for sure be selling my bullish position  lol  :P",2024-09-16
Regarding the Panama exchange rate : Panama uses the USD !,2024-09-15
"What about Copa airlines?  Symbol is CPA.  Excellent profits, supper low p/e, great yield and somewhat dominant positioin in the central S. American market",2024-09-14
@numbers girl I have to believe that Ryanair is the model for the future. More planes linking smaller airports with pay for amenity bare bones service. I fly Ryanair a few times a year and I consider it superior to Southwests overall package.,2024-09-11
"@wave-rider What you miss is that the CEO's, especially Kirby at United have touted the continued growth of basic economy as the big win against the low cost airlines, but instead, doing so sacrifices  total revenue. The problem in your model is (using  your example): 1 - your example indicates a margin of 20% while real life margins are half that.2 - load factors are around 85%, so it is likely that on some flights one of those seats are going empty, and it might be a first class seat that is given to a high status passenger flying a discounted coach fare (not basic economy which is not eligible for upgrades). The fallacy of basic economy fares is that they pull demand from the low cost airlines, when in fact, a big portion of the people that buy those fares would have paid for one of the regular economy classes on the same airline, but are being offered discounted economy and basic economy fares which they buy.  The more basic economy seats an airline offers, the more they are likely to convert regular economy customers to basic economy.There is no ability for the big-3, faced with rapidly escalating prices, to continually increase this strategy and maintain their profitability.  Increasing just lowers profitability.CASM is an industry standard measure which counts seats, not square footage.  If you want to adjust for square footage, I would like to see your worksheet, but, since basic economy is 6-8 cents per mile, you have a very long way to go to close a ~10-13 cent gap.  I dont think you could ever come up with that big a difference planewide.Your statement that  ""isn’t effecting the bottom line"" is not correct.  My comment that ""The story line that the big-3 will compete with basic economy and destroy the Low Cost Airlines is coming to an end as costs ratchet for the big-3."" continues to be correct.",2024-09-11
"@markcc indeed, I’m really interested to see the plans Elliot has for southwest- maybe we will have the big 4 sometime",2024-09-11
