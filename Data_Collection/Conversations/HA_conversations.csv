"@OverTheHorizon ""In play"" means it is possible.Definitely, but don't expect any real premium over market cap. While no bankruptcy in near term, management has to consider that  best action on behalf of the shareholders which is preservation of their capital in a merger. Of course, Spirit management knows more about passenger trends than we know here.If true, JBLU or ULCC likelies, but ALGT or Breeze possible..",2024-09-19 16:24:36.344997
"@astute pathways Assets need to be supported with other infrastructure. Merely buying the planes in bankruptcy, loses the rest of the infrastructure costs like offices, gates, employees and maintenance facilities, call centers, etc.  Then you would lose the frequent flyer program, with an off balance sheet value in the billions.Buying a running entity has greater value than buying the pieces separately.  Mergers are based on synergies. Cost savings from consolidation and duplication typically drive mergers.  I am sure Alaska has calculated all that before proposing the merger.",2024-09-19 16:24:36.344997
@AirJer33 That merger was shut down in its current form where jetBlue was to convert Spirit planes to higher cost JetBlue configuration. But a refiling may have different outcomes.,2024-09-17 00:00:00.000000
So they let this go through but not the JBLU and SAVE merger? Someone must have done some (good) hand greasing...,2024-09-17 00:00:00.000000
"@astute pathways Assets, like planes, are impossible to get and would have sold at a giant premium in a plane market with strikes and supplier issues.",2024-09-17 00:00:00.000000
"HA was near BK...It would have been cheaper to let them go out of business,and bid on their assets. All this without adding HA huge debt.",2024-09-17 00:00:00.000000
@ToadMuffin Plus Hawaiian Airlines already made the investments to absorb the Dreamliner into the fleet.,2024-08-30 00:00:00.000000
"it is not at all surprising that UAL is expressing the concern that other airlines also feel - HA has played a role as being the sole carrier with which other US carriers - and many foreign carriers - can ticket intra-Hawaii segments.  While there are far fewer mainline passengers that are visiting multiple islands in the same trip that originates outside of Hawaii, there is still a market and ALK/HA could easily shut down that market.The DOT is likely to require some sort of requirement that codesharing w/ all carriers continue as they currently exist and potentially require ALK to allow new airlines operating flights into Hawaii to be able to codeshare w/ ALK/HA into the future.",2024-08-29 00:00:00.000000
"Other airlines have code-share with Hawaiian; the DOT should get that United may also be worried about stronger competition for west coast flights to the islands, not really a problem....",2024-08-29 00:00:00.000000
"The only solution to mitigate overlapping routes is divestitures which bring in new carriers to maintain the same level of competition for the mainland-Hawaii city-pairs..LUV is losing $ already in HI, SAVE/JBLU having their own issues and will not be able to justify an expansion which doesn't have a short term payoff. The proposed combination will no doubt result in higher fares/fewer choices for consumers and there is no way to change the narrative otherwise...",2024-08-28 00:00:00.000000
"Routes are compatible, aggressive competitors make it imperative that Hawaiian merge with stronger partner.   Culture is closest with ALK.  Knowing that fact is number one in eyes of native Hawaiian.  Routes to Asia maybe as important to survival.",2024-08-28 00:00:00.000000
"@astute pathways Alaska Airlines wants the 787 options that HA has with Boeing.  If Alaska put in an order for 787's now, the wait time would be 8-10 years before delivery.  HA can exercise their options now if they choose and the aircraft would be delivered in 1-2 years.If HA got to the place where they had to declare bankruptcy and liquidate their assets, those 787 options would be returned to Boeing.  Most airline bankruptcy cases end up in restructuring anyway, not liquidation, so hoping that HA liquidates is a long shot. This deal has nothing to do with cheaper....it has everything to do with the quick and agressive growth of Alaska Airlines.",2024-08-28 00:00:00.000000
"Hawaiian has already stated that they have concerns about continuing business operations beyond 3 years or so.  If the shareholders voted yes, and there is no real anti-trust issue, it seems strange for the DoT to quibble about reductions in overlapping routes.  If those routes were profitable, they would be retained.",2024-08-23 00:00:00.000000
@Skagit there have not been many airline mergers approved without conditions so the process may not be over yet,2024-08-22 00:00:00.000000
"@Tim Dunn There was also that odd note about a DOJ or FTC attorney who had handled cases filing to practice in Hawaii.  Now, did he do that as subterfuge for an approval or is there more... um, paperwork to hit the fan?  I was not/am not long, but that news item added several feet to my not touching pole.",2024-08-22 00:00:00.000000
"SAVE and HA were close to BK...Its always cheaper to buy the BK assets at Auction , and not get saddled with debt buying the whole company",2024-08-22 00:00:00.000000
The DOT said shortly after the merger was announced that it would object.  The DOJ might not be filing suit but the DOT will be the bad guy,2024-08-22 00:00:00.000000
