This company is a financial disaster.  It overpaid for Spitit's low quality-junk properties,2024-10-08 10:44:08.641185
"@ChristopherSmith This is comparing apples and oranges.  I divide my holdings into 3 buckets: growth, income and value.  The primary, pretty much passive vehicle for growth and income are index funds and CDs/Money Markets respectively.I consider value to be a hybrid of the first two.  It should give me at least as much income as CDs/Money Markets, but also grow.  I like 5% divi growth but I have to think (ie. research) hard about what to include and limit how much I invest .  O gives a bit less than that but is very safe, returns should more resemble income than growth.  I can feel comfortable putting almost as much in it as I would owning a commercial property myself.",2024-10-08 10:44:08.641185
@VoiceofSanitySometimes agreed . Buffet's going to cash for the 5% yield also,2024-10-08 10:44:08.641185
"The chart of the top 20 clients should create some concern.  Walgreens is closing 25% of their stores and has serious financial issues.  Dollar General is not doing well.  Red Lobster is a shell of what it was (pun intended).  CVS, while the strongest of the pharmacies, is still closing some stores.Personally, not a fan of O at 5% yield when I can make about the same amount with cash.  And while the stock price has had lots of ups and downs over the past few years (great opportunities for short-term traders), it is now sitting at about the average over that period which isn't a time to buy.",2024-10-08 10:44:08.641185
"I agree with previous comments that O doesn't appear to have a strong upside based on its current valuation (potentially gaining 9% by end of 2025 using the FastGraphs tool), but it does have a very S&P strong credit rating of A- and its price should benefit if the Fed interest rate continues to drop.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
Thanks for another great article.  I always look forward to reading them.I have no regrets buying Realty Income over a year ago when it fell below $60.  Also no regrets adding to it when it fell to $53.  And no regrets getting monthly dividend payments from another dividend aristocrat either.,2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@Leo Nelissen SOBO doesn't start trading in America until 10/7, tomorrow.  I have about $2k in SOBO stock as far as I can tell.  I'll hold until I can learn more, but I will potentially add to it.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@Leo Nelissen  Thanks for the breakdown of 'O' from start to finish.  It is definitely a safe, steady income producer that retirees like me can count on for income that continues to grow, at an albeit slow rate, but growing none the less and is currently fair-valued to very slightly undervalued.  It's a core position for me but unfortunately I was adding when its price was a good bit higher.  My avg cost is $60.59/sh but I have full confidence it will in the future return near to or above the top of its trading range!  Still dripping and I don't mind the more than $1,100 monthly dividend dropping into my IRA one bit.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@Leo Nelissen,From $PR, $LB, $VNOM, $VRN, etc., and soon to be issued $SOBO on the NYSE my laser focus has been energy recently- and still is. I rearranged my daughter’s portfolio a few months back with $O, $VICI, $ADC, $NNN, etc. Arguably the ship has left to dock and for some the port for open seas. But for me it was energy Leo!It is still an undervalued frontier but the valuation gap like with $O or $ADC it is closing daily.Hope you have a great Sunday evening!PS Can I join the “Me2’’ chorus about your energy exposés too! They are great!",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"Realty Income is considered a typical autopilot investment due to its consistent and reliable dividend payments, which have been maintained for over 30 years without a single year of negative operational return. The company’s diversified portfolio, consisting of over 15,000 properties across 1,500 clients and 8 countries, provides stability and reduces risks. Additionally, Realty Income’s strong balance sheet, with low leverage and high credit ratings, ensures financial resilience. The company’s investments strategic and disciplined growth approach further support its long-term success.Long $OAutopilot investments like Realty Income fit perfectly into autopilot portfolios like mine, I would be inclined to say.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@Sam_12 Interesting! Btw, what did you do with your SOBO shares (TRP spin off) - if you don't mind me asking?",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"I own O, VICI, WPC, AM, ENB, TRP, CTO, VZ and PFE for income.  I expect all of these companies to appreciate somewhat over time. Of the foregoing companies mentioned, I overweight O, VICI, AM, ENB and TRP at a 2:1 ratio compared to WPC, CTO, VZ and PFE.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@ChristopherSmith If you are looking for ""growth"" then I am not sure why you hold O. It's a great retiree or high dividend stock in a portfolio",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"To say that that Realty Income is much better than its stock price suggests is hardly reassuring to the investor who bought it 8 years ago, the price being the same as it is today.  SPY and VOO have more than doubled in that same time period. Yes, it does hand out a minuscule regular dividend increase to preserve its “aristocrat” status, but this has hardly been enough to stimulate price growth. If you have a ton of money and want safety, this a good one.  If you’re a young investor trying to build a sold growth portfolio and build for your future, in my opinion, O is a dud.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"As you know, Leo, I sold all of my REITs (PLD, CCI and O) and redeployed all of the proceeds (and more) into a multitude of energy names, including PR that you highlighted in an article last week. Obviously, I would much rather be in energy stocks now, and I dove in head first as energy stocks now represent over 25% of the total portfolio value in our family's main account.I respect your work immensely, so how in the world can I disagree with you when you say the following about Realty Income (O):""Hence, even after its recent rally, I believe this company remains a total no-brainer for everyone looking for high-quality income, supported by a multi-trillion tailwind from a potential cash rotation.""Your analysis is thorough and balanced, and you articulate solid reasons why Realty Income (O) is a great investment suggestion.I admit that if we were engaged in a debate on the topic, you would definitely win. You present real facts to support your thesis, while my concerns are based more upon fear than upon facts.Notwithstanding my admission, I remain far more concerned about the adverse impacts of potential interest rate moves and about vacancies than everyone else on the planet. As I have disclosed previously, my emotions are tainted by my stint as CEO of a publicly held REIT in the 1980s when higher interest rates and much higher vacancy rates adversely impacted our portfolio of commercial and residential properties.Once again demonstrating how investor sentiment (in my case, meaning bad memories and fear) can supersede investment decisions that might be different if one were to look only at the financial metrics. The signal and the noise? [with a nod to the book by the well-renowned statistician Nate Silver]One final comment on interest rates. We all noticed how the 10 year Treasury yield moved up toward 4% Friday afternoon in the wake of the stronger than expected September jobs report, constraining us to ponder whether the 50 bps cut by the Fed was so excessive as to reignite inflationary forces. I recognize your disdain for the report itself, but the bond market was definitely sending a signal that was different than the stock market, and it was unusual for the stock market to move up so much in contrast to the 40 bps rise in interest rates. Aren't they supposed to move inversely to each other?And did you notice that the 2/10 year Treasury spread dipped from about 30 bps to only 3 bps last week? Is the spread trying to re-invert? If so, what are the implications of this for the stock market?How is the foregoing discussion relevant to O? Because, if interest rates are not going to be cut by the Fed as soon or as often as predicted, and inflation does rear its ugly head again, then my energy stocks are going to far out-perform O and the other REITs out there. I'm trying to keep my eyes laser focused on the big picture as I make individual stock picks in light of my macro thesis. Just like you, Leo!! You're the best!!After all, Sunday is not just about football. It's also Big Paper Day, and Big Picture Day too!",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
Can't we move on ? I look at SA and there is yet another analyst boosting O and writing at great length to make exactly the same pitch for it.,2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
Not enough capital appreciation potential.  Author should check out SOHO.  Just bought yesterday.  It's a small REIT that has been driven to almost nothing.  Easy double.,2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
