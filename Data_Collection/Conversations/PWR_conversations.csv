"@kalu0003 It depends on your investment objectives. PWR is up 15% since I made that comment, nice for only 3 months but we'll see where it goes from here. I invested in POWL and UAL around that time. POWL and UAL are up 36% and 27% respectively so far, we'll see from here. In the energy portion of my portfolio I have POWL, EMR, HESM- looking to see if I want to stay thru the CVX acquisition, recently added SEDG as a value position, and have a small position in ENPH bought on the dip in July. I also exited ET and DVN earlier this year. I would like to add something else but not sure if it will be something like PWR, ED, or nuclear which is seeing not only improving sentiment but actual deals being closed which is new in that space. When deciding where to allocate capital, I don't take every opportunity where I think I will get ANY return. In the current bull market, it is hard not to get some positive return, the S&P 500 is up 6% since late July when I made the comment about PWR. PWR should continue growing and might ultimately do better than POWL and EMR which are the 2 companies most comparable in my portfolio, I just thought more of that future growth was already priced into PWR so the risk/return was not as good over the next year.",2024-09-25

"@Gytis Zizys This article is of Aug 13, 2024 with fair value estimate of $194 for PWR. Today is Sept 25, 2024 with PWR trading at $298.24.  Would you please help us understand what a heck is going on with PWR? Is there something wrong with PWR as it does not seem to follow what you are preaching in your article? Thanks in advance.",2024-09-25
