"@Pedro Goulart the reason I went long into these names is because I can take my family of 6 to them and spend the same amount as if I took them to mcdonalds or subway.  Litterally.  They are better food, and better service, for the same or less price.  That is a competitive advantage.  Mcdonalds has cut their prices (I've heard) but I swore off fast food after the ridiculous price increases, terrible service, and asking for tips at the counter before service is rendered (subway). So i don't know if that is still true.  We will see but I appreciate your feedback and I enjoy your detailed articles.",2024-09-30
Dominoes was one of the best stocks to own as it went from $3 to $300 over a 10 year period.  There are a lot of names that are feeling the pinch and their stock is down.  Great opportunity to own household names at a historically low price.  Or you could wait for the turnaround to have already happened and buy them at twice the price.,2024-09-30
I think y'all missed the bottom on this.  They are rebounding and will continue to rebound.  See you at $70.,2024-09-27
30 PT doesn't seem possible 39 gets bought like crazy and I would buy more myself  at 39 but it's cheap at 46.I'm long and holding looking for 70 dollars in two years or less.,2024-09-27
"@Martin Chuzzlewhit Hi Martin, how are you? In my last analysis of Cracker I focused more on the valuation side. I came to the conclusion that yes, Cracker is discounted. But, as the fundamentals are still cloudy, I prefer to keep the 'Hold'. As little has changed in relation to future cash flow expectations, I preferred to keep my PT.",2024-09-23
@Martin Chuzzlewhit  I agree new CEO vet is Taco Bell I believe turns this company around I am very long at $46,2024-09-23
"You've obviously got an encyclopaedic knowledge of the restaurant industry, and CBRL in particular. My only quibble is the lack of earnings information. My WSJ subscription gives me access to their deeply flawed estimate(s) page. From there, I learn that for the year just ended, Cracker reported eps of $1.83 for a P/E of 22.3. For FY 25 they report an estimate of $2.87 for a forward P/E of 14.3.In comparison, Chipoltle is expected to report $1.07 this calendar year, up from $0.89 in 2023. So a P/E of 54.5. Unfortunately they don't give me a 2025 estimate, but let's imagine that the forward P/E is about 46.5 if Chipoltle is able to report eps of $1.25 next year. I don't know your opinion of CMG but obviously the rest of the investment world loves it. Myself, I'd rather have a plate of warts at 14 X and a dollar dividend than what's popular (and expensive). Hope your future write-ups give us a little flavour of valuation.",2024-09-23
"@CWall65 Restaurant companies and retailers make a very big mistake when they rely excessively on debt, they lose the flexibility to make necessary changes.",2024-09-22
"@diroha fair enough, but that is looking backwards. The new CEO was a vice president with Taco Bell and it's lots of experience growing and changing restaurant operations. Yes there is some risk. However, the stock is down a tremendous amount and is also a lot of upside potentially that I am willing to and have put some money to work in the mid 40s.",2024-09-21
Once a big fan of this restaurant but they are failing miserably since the pandemic. I donâ€™t see a clear path. The best plan is to sell it to Darden who knows how to profitably run these chains,2024-09-20
"Those are non-GAAP earnings, traffic is down 4%  their demographic skews older and they are close to being financially constrained. I agree with the ""thanks but no thanks"" recommendation .",2024-09-19
The balance sheet is at risk of getting them into a financial jam if sales do not turn soon.,2024-09-19
"With good food and service, as all mention, opportunity exists to right the financial ship. They have room to raise prices, as they are considerably cheaper then most sit down service restaurants.One more leg down without bankruptcy protection is my thesis to buy.",2024-09-17
