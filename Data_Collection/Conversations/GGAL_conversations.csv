"The government gave a sign of its economic muscle on Friday and, three months in advance, transferred the funds to pay debt maturities due next January in global bonds. The money is already in the Bank of New York. An unprecedented advance for an Argentina accustomed to almost always arriving with its tongue hanging out to meet its obligations.The Government's planets are aligning to win the fight against the dollarAnalysts expect the calm of the exchange rate to continue during October. What other factors would favor the Government to get closer to lifting the restrictions?The parallel dollars can continue to fall: are the planets aligning to get out of the restrictions?The Government is seeking to capitalize on the second indicator that society is always looking at, along with inflation. The dollar rate is a key variable for millions of Argentines, whether or not they buy foreign currency.The behavior of the North American currency influences many goods and services in the economy, and reflects the mood of many people. Governments that kept the dollar at bay were always successful at the polls. That is why Milei celebrates this moment when the North American currency is falling in all its forms, especially the blue, which was below $1,200, and the financial MEP and CCL.Dollar down: are the ""planets aligning"" to lift the restrictions?Specialists believe that this phenomenon will continue during October, since the Government decided to extend phase 1 of the money laundering, which will provide the most liquidity to the banks.The summer exchange rate deepened this week with strong falls in the blue dollar and the financial markets. This Friday, in the marginal market, the blue dollar broke the floor of $1,200, and the trend will deepen in the coming weeks.The strong inflow of dollars to the money laundering surprised the market, which did not expect such a large adhesion, especially having the very good result obtained by the regularization of capitals launched by the government of Mauricio Macri.Some operators became enthusiastic and began to talk about an ""alignment of planets"" that brings the lifting of the exchange rate restriction a few steps closer, a measure increasingly mentioned by reports from investment banks and consulting firms as a condition for the release of investments to Argentina.In the market, they point out that this ""alignment of planets"" could include a dollar falling towards the $1,100 zone, rising reserves, fiscal and trade surpluses and a falling country risk to lift the restrictions. The country risk prepared by JP Morgan fell sharply this week and is approaching the 1,200 point zone.Financial consultant Federico Domínguez also highlighted that the fall in parallel dollars is due to the Government's decision to cut monetary emission. There are fewer pesos to demand foreign currency.In addition, the BCRA's signal that it buys in the MULC and sells in financial institutions helped close the exchange gap, which is at one of the lowest levels of the year.The drop in rates in the United States also had an influence, which strengthens the currencies of emerging countries and boosted the price of commodities a little.At a local level, better data on the economy and some signs of growth reinforce confidence in Milei's program, according to Domínguez.According to this specialist, financial dollars can continue to fall until they converge with the crawling peg.The effect of money laundering on the price of parallel dollarsThis is what the Government is looking for. With a fiscal surplus, zero emission and income of dollars due to trade surplus and investments, it is an achievable and central objective in the anti-inflationary program, according to those close to the Minister of Economy, Luis Caputo.The most determining factor in the dynamics of parallel dollars is money laundering, with deposits that reached their highest level since the PASO of 2019, explains economist Gabriel Caamaño.The fact that the dollars that entered the money laundering are being invested in local assets gives more support to the dollar prices of the bonds and that causes the implicit exchange rates that form the cash settlement and the MEP dollar to fall.""The decline is there, the blue dollar is a small market that is dragged down by financial dollars,"" says Caamaño.Experts also point out that the Government began to intervene in financial dollars from July onwards with the currencies purchased by the BCRA. They explain that with this strategy, Milei's administration sent a very clear message that it will not allow the gap to go too high. This caused the market to turn to peso rates.At an international level, the context also helps, since last week the dollar index hit its lowest level of the year, and details such as the fact that the Central Bank is buying reserves again add more downward momentum for parallel dollars.According to the operator of PR Corredores de Cambio, Gustavo Quintana, the prices are adjusting to a scenario in which the monetary restriction impacts, because the lack of pesos is noticeable in the marginal market.He indicated that ""there is little demand and greater supply."" ""The prices respond to this reality with falls that place them at levels not anticipated by analysts,"" he said.And he said that the financial dollars are also adjusting to a scenario in which several factors converge, since the exporters maintain a good level of income, not usual for this part of the year, and due to the effect of the blend, they feed the supply in those segments.""The dollars that entered the system as a consequence of the money laundering are also doing their thing and finally, at least for now, the exchange rate tension that fueled increases in previous months has disappeared,"" said Quintana.The behavior of inflation is also contributing. According to Juan Pedro Mazza, a fixed-income strategist at Cohen, the prices of market assets reflect that inflation would continue to fall gradually, while the interest rate would rise slightly.He said that with a more orderly economy but with a currency exchange rate restriction, ""the exchange rate gap would persist, although at lower levels than the current ones.""The market also points to the possible arrival of foreign currency as a factor that depresses dollar quotes. For Gustavo Neffa, a specialist at Research for Traders, the accumulation of reserves and the expectation of a REPO of between US$4,000 and US$5,000 million that would strengthen debt maturities in January, are elements that are sustaining this calm in the exchange market.To capitalize on this scenario, the Government gave a signal of its economic muscle on Friday and turned over, three months in advance, the funds to pay debt maturities next January for global bonds. The money is already in the Bank of New York. An unprecedented anticipation for an Argentina accustomed to almost always arriving with its tongue hanging out to fulfill its obligations.",2024-10-06
@Ra's al Ghul new loan demand will certainly challenge credit judgement given the range of outcomes at the macro level and political dynamics  .If Caputo can’t do it nobody can.

"In these values, it is leaving a nice candle in weekly compression that should be the prelude to a bullish movement next week. Ideally, it should close like this but with the body in green. For that it would have to close at 43.75 or higher. The bearish projection of a HcH, with a target that would imply a correction of 25%. Well, nothing. A priori, it seems strange that in a macro context with indicators that show a good evolution, we can see a correction of such magnitude. The country risk will probably be at 1,100 next week, strong accumulation of reserves for several weeks. Strong fall in inflation. Money laundering contributing its part. In fact, the blue has just broken 1,200 and is now at 1,195.-. Obviously, those who stayed in dollars lost badly in recent months, so it seems that the tubes are coming undone… circumstances all pointing to an opening, at least gradual, of the cepo… For that reason, a priori it seems strange that it executes a bearish resolution figure, which implies a 25% setback, but as they say in certain jargons, no hypothesis is ruled out, especially because the rise of the GGAL was vertical, etc… we will have to see what position is imposed, and where it defines in this area… We will see if the 45.- is going to be tested, and how the candle ends in weekly compression… finally, add that there is a boom in personal loans, both in pesos and in dollars  .  www.iprofesional.com/...   … The greatest asset of the banks is the granting of credits, showing a good performance… Something that will later be reflected in their balance sheets… banks that also have their vaults quite full of dollars in recent weeks due to money laundering…",2024-10-04
"Yesterday almost double the volume of today's rise was traded. The volume seems strangled in that area, leaving a double bottom, a reversal doji, respecting a 38.2 fibonacci, which has been testing for three days of trading, and the MACd which is at caramel point. I don't know, but in theory it has a tail, four legs, and it barks, and I don't know, we'll see. A priori, a possible wedge, target 45.5. We'll see if later the trend consolidates and this continues. The BCRA buys again, this time it was 106 million. It is the third day that it has accumulated reserves above 100 million. And the Government wants to bring inflation to 2%, so it would suspend tax increases and other milestones. www.iprofesional.com/... . 47.55.- is the magic number here, in the GGAL ADR, but the Merval and the volume have to follow the trend, if the momentum is to be recovered. Measured in dollars, the Merval, if it reaches historical highs, from this area would imply an advance of 31%. The incredible thing is that in dollars the Merval does not give up its advance. It has been appreciating in hard currency since August 2022. . GGAL / WEDGE. .www.tradingview.com/...",2024-10-02
"Great data, core inflation in September 2.6% according to some consulting firms... the parallel dollar also falls, 1.215... we will see if next week it breaks through 1.200... The official dollar today stands at 1.005.-... ever closer to convergence, and to the possibility of an opening of the cepo... Milei said last week that he will lift the cepo when inflation reaches 2.5%, we will see how far we are from removing capital controls.",2024-10-02
"In hourly compression, the MACd has a lot of room to rise, when this comes out... in daily compression, it is gradually looking good... for now leaving two candles between today and yesterday that where they are located, are usually a change of trend... the EMA20 for now acting as resistance, at 42.55.- dollars... Will the gap close at 37/38, in the short term, or will it resume the bullish momentum?, and perhaps we will close it after the mid-term legislative elections... Gaps sometimes force us to sell badly, waiting for a possible closure that finally, sometimes, ends up not happening... It can close today, as it can do in 20 years... and I understand that the statistics say that 80% of the GAPS close... I don't know how reliable those statistics are... but anyway, there we are. For now decompressing oscillators in daily compression, and this at the moment, quite far from going to look for that gap. To start with, it should lose 40.- dollars, so that this scenario can be considered. . The equation does not change for us if it closes or not, those who try to surf, entering and leaving corrections, will be left ""hanging from the brush"", in case it does not do so. . That is why, leaving many times ends up being very expensive. . And upwards it has the great resistance at 47.55.- (a 61.8 fibonacci retracement), if it breaks that milestone, or when it breaks it better said, it will have another bullish sprint, ""big mac size"". . It will probably look for the highs of 2018. . GGAL today has a PER of 7 years and something. . The PER of banks in emerging markets averages 13 years... Without a doubt, this still has a good upward path left, even . .",2024-10-02

"The market is assuming and discounting that the GGAL ADR will close the gap at 37.-, but perhaps the action will continue to rise without closing it yet. . I understand that it is an optimal moment for it to close it, and thus it will not remain open for us. . but, if it is not the moment to close it, as they say in the jargon, ""they can leave you hanging by the brush"" waiting for it to happen. . the country risk has been falling at a good pace, today it closed at 1,288 basic pts. . the Central Bank has been strengthening the reserves for many weeks. . today October starts adding another 122 million. . The gap with the different exchange rates is narrowing, with the official (CCL dollar, blue dollar), and the other thing is the drop in inflation. . Translation, two variables that bring us closer to the release of exchange control. . In reality there would be three variables... and I would include a fourth... strengthening of reserves, convergence of the different dollars with the official one, lower inflation, which this month for the first time would break 4%... Today the ""blue"" or parallel dollar was trading in the range of 1,200/1,220... Add to all this that we are in the stage of money laundering... Banks are giving credits, even in dollars... and the 4th variable would be to see a little economic recovery... it happens that as they are balancing the strong fiscal imbalances that there were, and sterilizing the surplus of pesos in the market... the economic recovery is slower... It happens that Argentina comes from three millennia of financing itself with inflation... But well, let's go back a little further... all those variables... increase in reserves, lower inflation, lower exchange rates, narrowing the gap with the official one... All of this brings us closer to the opening of exchange controls... I'm not saying that it's just around the corner... It's likely to be sometime in 2025, and it's not ruled out that it will be after the legislative elections... let's hope it doesn't take too long, but for that to happen, we have to continue strengthening the Central Bank's reserves, and continue to suffocate inflation... Imagine next year, without exchange controls, with a good cushion of reserves in the Central Bank, with inflation of 2%, perhaps 1%... and growth in economic activity... Leaving aside political sympathies, all of this that I mention, of course, will result in a good performance of our capital market, seeking those 3,400 dollars that we were proposing. . the possible WAVE 3 of that possible Elliott would be at 2,800 dollars... That is, x2 of what the Merval is worth today in hard currency... We'll see...#GGAL #ELLIOTT #www.tradingview.com/...",2024-10-01

"@Ra's al Ghul as you say..."" we'll see"".   I see Vaca Muerta as the straw that will stir the most viable sectors for the next five years (if lithium ever improves I'd add that to the list).   For the banks, its a normalization of Import/export business and importantly the FDI impact of privatization and VM that will be a huge tail wind.  In that regard, I don't pay as much attention to the bank metrics we focus on in a more stable US banking environment...say the BV  that seems high at GAAL today.  The legacy banks like Nacion and Provincia (who I lent to hand over first in the early 80s are from a era of political ties which under Macri are obsolete to a good extent.

"@Ra's al Ghul Great looking chart.So it will take till 2035 to get to point 5 of the Elliot wave at Merval 3600.I'm 73 years old and I'm not sure I have enough gas in the tank to make it to age 85.My mother is 100 and still around and doing well. So there is hope. hahahaSo the Point 4 is still higher than today or the high of Macri in 2018.My question is how much will the Merval be influenced by the markets in the US, the Mag 7 correcting 80%, a recession in 2025 in the US with the general market going down 40% ala the dot.com bust of 2000???I have raised some cash and I only hold 5 shares each VIST, YPF, PAM, TGS.I just hope I can find the power to sit on my hands (actually TBIL for now), and not blow it (spend it) too early.Thanks for the great updates. 2035 puts it way past the 8 years of Milei ending in 2031 if he manages to hang around for 8 years.
