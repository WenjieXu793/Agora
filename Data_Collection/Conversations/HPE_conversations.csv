"@Jlagreen isn't using nvidia gpu for inference is like using a cannon to kill a fly ? During the training, you load a mini-batch of data into the GPU ram, and perform both forward and backpropagation.For inference, rather, you have much more inference requests at same time (thinking about millions of people making query on GPT). That is to say, you need load a much much larger batch of input data into the ram and perform forward only. This changes the architecture, and GPU isn't optimized for inference.",2024-10-04
@Henrich0807 Nvidia!Why? Because all the training data center can be used for inferencing as well.That's why competition has such a problem. Nobody buys 2 data centers. It's like you would get several cars for different purposes and switch when you need it while you could also look for 1 car being able to do good in several tasks.,2024-10-04
"As an investor in and advisor of industrial-scale data center developments, Bernstein's research seems directionally correct...including the prospect of a boom-bust cycle.",2024-10-02
"Interesting, watching HPE/HPQ since BDJ opened positions in those earlier in the year. We'll see how that value play pays off.",2024-09-25
Buy the convertible shares here. They offer the best risk/reward profile.,2024-09-24
"This one weirdly dropped after their preferred share offering. My only explanation were people believing that to be a dilutive offering or somehow conflating that with SMCI's stock offerings. Now, it is weirdly up a good amount based on this report.",2024-09-17
@Benjamin Graham Cracker it’s not the products they sell that’s woke it’s the management team that runs the company that makes the network equipment that is woke.  The company use to be focused on delivering the best customer experience and outcomes and now they shifted that focus towards everything but this.  Deliver the best services and solutions with high profit and run the business like a business vs focusing too much on now business issues coming from all this wasted time on DEI.,2024-09-16
"Investors just don't understand the As a Service piece of HPE's revenue recognition and how that affects long term value. Heck, analysts barely understand it themselves. From GAAP, we see no to barely any growth this year but that understates the biz momentum. Simply HPE needs to do better educating what Greenlake means and disclose the service backlog. Breaking out product vs service orders is only a first step.",2024-09-12
"@qwerty11 This is more like debt but in pfd form so it does not hurt their credit rating. The mandatory convert aspect of that would align with the credit rating comment. I do not think anyone is buying this to convert to shares as the conversion mechanism ranges depending on the stock price. Hence, this is not truly dilutive if taking into account the disincentive of converting to shares.",2024-09-12
"Worked there for over 20 years.  HPE has a terrible batting average when it comes to large acquisitions.  Aruba has been the only meaningful acquisition and that’s because HPE bought them and left them alone.  Others like the 12B acquisition of Autonomy, EDS and I’m sure with Juniper have all been a waste of shareholder money.  They can handle small takeovers but unfortunately they’re not able to find the unicorns early enough to buy.  Anyway, I have zero confidence that they can pull this one off.  I’d stay clear of this stock until they get thru this acquisition.",2024-09-11
BUY backs upon a $14B acq is a GD gimmick...stop the baffonery,2024-09-11
Why diluting while wildly profitable? Answer: the management wants to make sure their salaries are guaranteed for the next 5 years. Not a good sign fo r the (few remaining) shareholders!,2024-09-11
@Hunter Wolf Research what’s your take with the news that came out yesterday on HPE issuing more stock.  Thanks,2024-09-10
Juniper is a $14b acq this isnt a suprise since its all.cash and hpe.has only $3b of cash plus $2b from recent stk sale.  So thats $6b and i assume they are selling rest of china stake for another $4b to make $10b with rest bank financing.,2024-09-10
