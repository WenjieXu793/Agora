"As the DOJs case against Google's ad tech gets wrapped up this week, an outcome that implicates Google could mean a windfall for GCI, wiping out a significant portion of the debt. And the recent restructuring of the debt, which occurred in August, was not mentioned in your article. In addition, the recent restructuring of the debt also took off the table any dilution for investors. Going forward, If GCI meets the current guidance and a ev/ebidta multiple is applied to the company that is in line with direct competitors, the stock is a $12-$15, regardless of the outcome of the Google lawsuit. Too many tailwinds for a Hold rating in my opinion.",2024-09-26
