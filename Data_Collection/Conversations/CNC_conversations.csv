"@golfcat1 we ought to control the border, but, we ought to be issuing enough work visas and green cards to offset Boomer retirements. That requires millions of immigrants per year.",2024-10-01
@santlo It won't. Markets will tank if the weird guys take over. They are a threat to democracy and capitalism.,2024-09-30
"@erbrown Don’t bet the farm on that. I don’t see cap gain tax on unrealized gains. For openers, evaluations are impossible, not only for the likes of farm land but also for 1000 shares of a publicly-traded stock, liquidity is a big deal. Then there’s the velue of the local family business. Not so fast.",2024-09-29

@slodon28 of course it will - just ask Milton Friedman. Spending leads to inflation (Why I sold any bond holding/ blended fund before 2022). Don't make this so hard.,2024-09-16
@TJ Burke Wont all of that NEW that government spending increase inflation?,2024-09-16

"Everyone in Centene's line of business knows their estimates will be wrong, so then it becomes a matter of by how much. No company in the Medicaid space is better than Centene.  What are CNC market participants so jittery about?  Ignore the noise.   There are about 10 million new US  migrants and many  will need healthcare.  Medicaid is the social safety net until they can get jobs and survive on their own. Medicaid is 1/2 Federal and 1/2 state funded.  States who get a lot of the migrants will have to expand their state programs, or they will be faced with third-world disease outbreaks.",2024-09-10

"@Brucejfern Having owned $MAIN, $ARCC, $OBDC, etc., in the past, I now think $PBDC or $BIZD (the ETFs with nice dividends) is the best way to participate in this sector. Spread the risk.
