Thanks for your article.. this is one of my longest largest holdings.. back to 1999.. so happy I held thru the ups and the downs.. its been ok.. not the best stock I own but happy to hold it and collect rising dividends. I was worried a couple years ago they might not continue to increase them annually.. but the CEO a call addressed it and said they expect it to continue. The rising margins will help us continue the streak.. hoping for another 25 years of ownership and rising dividends!,2024-09-26
@EliasMouawad I recently bought DVN in March at $47.91. It keeps going down. You will have a much better entry point.,2024-09-17
Interesting article. I am rotating out of REITs and buying DVN near the 52 week low. Share buyback program plus a decent div yield makes it one of the most attractive stocks now.,2024-09-17
"@jack kreg great minds think like, I bought both EMR (initial stake) and HON (added to long-term stake) last month.  I don't expect either of these to be really high flyers, but instead, companies that continue to generate solid cash flows and safe dividends.  I view them as relatively safer ways to play secular growth trends outside of the semiconductor industry (which I'm already very long as well).",2024-09-11
"NW, EMR does have the potential for the growth you describe, via automation that will likely become ingrained across industry. They do have to execute, their history is only average on that..12 years ago, I reviewed industrial companies; GE, UTX, EMR and HON. Luckily, I bought HON at about $50/share, while at $200 that is a solid gain, HON has kind of stalled. Luckily, i did not buy EMR then at $50, as we know it now trades at $100, so 2X against 4X for HON. Still, I think that you are onto something with industrial automation and I am buying some EMR under $100 today in my boys accounts. I am 74, so I need more current yield. I am also buying Rockwell Automation, ROK, as well at about $250, which seems like a low. I could break lower with continued market weakness. ROK trades at PE 25X forward earnings. If these companies execute, they should enjoy strong sales and earnings growth over years/decades. DD and invest in the future. All Best, JKActually, HON looks undervalued today at $203, PE(2025) 18X......Happily, I own a lot of HON, so will not be adding to that position, but EMR and ROK are buys.....",2024-09-11
