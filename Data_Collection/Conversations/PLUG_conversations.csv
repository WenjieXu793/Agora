"@Larry Ramer Again, this is nonsense.So far, none of Plug Power's advertised large-scale project wins have come to fruition and this latest project announcement is not likely to be any different.In case you haven't noticed: There is no funding for the $6.5 billion project in place so there's very little sense in ""finalizing the sales and purchase agreement"" at this time.Today's news is pure stock promotion, as usual.",2024-10-08 11:18:29.619749
"It looks like Plug's BEDP deals can lead to huge contracts.Plug "" has signed a binding framework agreement with Allied Green Ammonia (AGA), an Australian company focused on green ammonia production, to finalize a supply agreement for three gigawatts (GW) of electrolyzer capacity."" But big revenue likely won't flow until the end of '26 at the earliest so the Street doesn't care that much...yet. seekingalpha.com/...",2024-10-08 11:18:29.619749
"@Phil Dumfee UNfortunately (for H2), BEV development and ramp has ramped faster and further than Hydrogen production....Process isn't efficient enough on an industrial scale to produce the quantities at an affordable price.Shame, I still feel the concept is more usable and customer friendly than current BEV charging.",2024-10-08 11:18:29.619749
@Investor since ‘73 I saw the huge potential a few years ago bought it and then sold out. Traction isn't there. Maybe next decade some thing will change.,2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000

"Nikola still remains the only serious effort in this unique product segment one that needs serious outside investment to get off the mat so to speak. Nikola has both the trucks and the fueling infrastructure product with one of those apparently sold for the first time in the past quarter. ""Battery power for inside building logistics"" does matter and $plug plug power is the leading specialty manufacturer in this market segment so yes, great news not bankrupt but seems to have followed the Chinese stock market into the abyss as with Nikola and Ballard Power. Tesla is ramping up Tesla semi production for the first time this Year 2024 so demand for electricity clearly will be on the rise materially when adding the still very material sales in battery electric vehicles. The DoE not pushing hydrogen fuel infrastructure just as a grid stabilization measure is absolutely making a big mistake as this is a validated fuel product now but still wholly lacking in the fueling infrastructure not for lack of trying tho.  Long Honda Motor Corporation strong buy",2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
@waterlogger Equinor:www.reuters.com/...Shell:finance.yahoo.com/...Please note that these were blue hydrogen projects which do not require Plug Power's electrolyzers.,2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
@Henrik Alex didn't Equinor and Shell both cancel large H2 projects recently?,2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
"The author should have probably taken a look at recent statements made by competitor Ballard Power before submitting this underwhelming piece:""(...) we see a multi-year push-out of the availability of low-cost, low carbon hydrogen and hydrogen refueling infrastructure.  As this delay represents a significant headwind to our corporate growth plan, we are implementing a cost restructuring to moderate our investment intensity and pacing to better align with delayed market adoption.""seekingalpha.com/...",2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000

So many good points made here and i agree with all of them. Strong Buy that's gusty The author must be expecting a big blue wave. There's no way Plug gets any more money if Trump wins or a split congress imo,2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"While I'm very pro clean H2 and believe it will play a significant part in a clean energy future, I'm skeptical about the authors claim that H2 powered vehicles are about to surge.  There is just not the infrastructure (H2 fueling stations) to support it.  Also, the production of clean and/or green H2 is just getting started.  I think it is more likely clean H2 will first find a market in hard to decarbonize sectors, such as:Heavy industry (steel and cement)FertilizerOcean shippingCommercial air travelNew eVTOL air taxies like JOBYNote that while JOBY is starting with a BEV air taxi they plan to extend the range using H2:www.jobyaviation.com/...I do think H2 powered cars and trucks will be an option in the future once the cost of green H2 comes down and fueling stations are common.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000

"No. Just no. Check a 5 year chart of this abysmal disaster of a stock, down from nearly $70 to $2, now a penny stock (current definition is any stock trading for under $5). That’s important because most funds are prohibited from owning penny stocks. Hydrogen is not the solution for what will be the next generation of transportation. Toyota is being sued by the few buyers of its failed attempt to bring hydrogen powered vehicles to market. They want to force Toyota to take them back, see link:www.autobodynews.com/...EVs are already the established next generation of transport, electricity is already available almost everywhere vehicles are driven. Fuel cells have proven to be unprofitable and rarely have a service life that equals the warranty. Check the chart and you will see a few short lived euphoric bumps higher, followed immediately by the resumption of the sickening slide. Penny stocks, being cheap and thinly traded are perfect candidates for the good old ‘pump and dump’ schemes and it’s possible that could be the case here. My best advice, based on 51 years investing experience is to avoid this loser.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
