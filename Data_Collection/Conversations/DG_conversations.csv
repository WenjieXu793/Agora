"Wonderfully informative and clearly written explanation of your analysis of the DG business cycle, historical earnings and stock price, potential future earnings and valuation. I especially liked the buy price at recession P/E+%adjustment concept.",2024-09-25

"@JaraSadlon Fair enough. But a business that has a long history of good performance is more likely to right the ship than one that doesn't. And, if we aren't going to use past performance as a guide, then we get into a world of speculation and story-telling. Investing becomes a game of creating a great narrative about how management will address some of the things you mention. I've found that is a less reliable way to invest. And as the factors you rightly point out (hopefully) improve, the stock price will immediately rise. We have to invest before that evidence is there for the market to see if we want above average returns.I think the odds are probably with management addressing some of these issues as long as revenues continue to grow. So, revenues over the next few years are the main thing I will be watching to see if the business is truly in danger of faltering.",2024-09-23
"The way you look at the stock is like judging a car by the fact that it has been running for ten years so far, so it will probably continue to run, even if it squeaks a bit under the hood. It could just be a belt replacement, but it could also be a seized engine. DG has its own internal problems, not that it doesn't. If it's just weakness in the main customer, how do you explain that sales are still up, gross margin remains, but operating margin is down and capex is up? It's certainly not just the customer's fault, it's something in the opex. Internal issues are things like understaffing, merchandise theft, declining sales of non-consumables (this especially needs to be explained!), shifting 80% of sales to low-margin consumables, higher cost of new merchandise mix (it's harder to ship and stock ice cream, yogurt, etc.), higher labor and energy costs, higher cost of building new stores, the price war with Family Dollar last year, shifting certain types of customers to Wallmart. These are the points an investor needs to see and watch to be able to decide whether management is righting the ship from or into the abyss.",2024-09-23
"@justaguy11 over 80 percent of retail is brick and mortar in the US and about that same rate is consumables ONLY sales at dollar general. It's not where the margins are, but you aren't shopping on temu if you are walking through a dollar general.",2024-09-19
"I did post this else where, but was wondering if you were able to assess. Were you able to explore the Capex further, it has increased quite dramatically? To me it looks like it's more for maintenance rather than growth. Any thoughts?",2024-09-19
"@rnb2019 I don't think I know enough granularity to pinpoint their problems. If that was something I was really good at I would take larger weighted positions in fewer stocks.What I try to do is find stocks that fit certain profiles that have shown to have a high probability of producing above-average returns and weighting positions about 1% on average. Usually, about 80% of the time medium-term returns are positive, but I don't know ahead of time which 20% will perform poorly. And, honestly, I don't think most investors benefit a lot from spending more time and doing deeper research on fewer stocks. Some do, of course, but I think there are also pitfalls that go along with trying to figure out and assume too much as well. I'm more comfortable admitting what I don't know, and sizing my positions accordingly.",2024-09-19

I took a bite at $84 but would still like to see it go lower.,2024-09-17
I think your last line is crucial - DLTR did not take market share - this is not an issue over operations - per se - but a badly impacted consumer. I continue to accumulate!,2024-09-16
Panic? I did not panic. I quadrupled my small position. All good!,2024-09-16
"@NorthZorro For items people are willing to wait for I don't think they can compete on price, so it will probably take tariffs or government regulation which is likely coming soon.",2024-09-16
@Socrates9 - why are they sending you an invoice via email?  Haven't they heard of email?,2024-09-15
"Trees don't grow to the sky.  Dollar general can't compete in certain markets.  They need to stay in their lane.  Having said that, im averaging down.  This company is required in rural America and is a good buy at these prices, imo.",2024-09-15
"CEO, John Barry, has made massive insider purchases of PSEC stock and equally stated, he is making a sh_tload of money in not only the management fess he gets, by owning the external management company (PCM - Prospect Capital Management ) that manages PSEC but also in the dividend income he receives from his purchases of PSEC stock - just massive income here.",2024-09-15
@Cory Cramer DG needs wages to catch up with inflation and see if the expansion of stores across the country moves the profitability needle. Then pivot to paying down debt and cleaning up the balance sheet. Maybe investing in the business can expedite that process.,2024-09-14

"@KEEPYOURMONEY  At the conference call he was rude - he presented the facts but even insulted those who disagreed or didnt understand.   This was two weeks or so ago.  The next couple of days he started a buying spree that has lasted all two weeks.   I wondered if he thought being rude would discourage investors, and make it cheaper for him to buy the several million shares.",2024-09-14
"@Socrates9 they could send an email with the bill and then you can setup billpay with your bank. Or if the bill is the same amount every month, just setup the billpay to pay automatically.",2024-09-14
