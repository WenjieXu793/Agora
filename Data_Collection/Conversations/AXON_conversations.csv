@sgossett I too have been amazed by the run. It was an F on valuation from Schwab at $290,2024-10-03
"AXON is a trump trade. Over 150x P/EBITDA, I think around 100 P/E... worth 3 times Nividia? Give me a break. This is a total meme stock by now. It's actually quite frustrating. I bought puts on it with 12% of my portfolio and it has went up since the strike.. insanity. Just goes to show not to mess with meme stocks. At least I've made 40% on my portfolio with vix calls for the strike. I learned a serious lesson from this AXON trade and my past CVNA puts.",2024-10-01
"I’m so overweight on AXON, I can’t even write about it here ",2024-09-30
"@Kyle28 I don't think you will have the opportunity to do that, pal. I get what you mean, but I don't think it's happening.",2024-09-24
"Many thanks for the article.AXON has always looked expensive so I appreciate and share your strategic perspective: growing integrated product offerings, excellent execution, huge TAM and geographic expansion opportunity, and (most importantly in my opinion) the stickiness of the business/client relationship. Sometimes paying a little more than a fair price for a truly great growth company makes sense.I’ve been long AXON for 5 years and plan to hold for the foreseeable future.",2024-09-18
"I advised a friend some seven or eight years ago that AXON (then TASR) would be the next Apple (AAPL).  Buy the shares and forget them.The same advice holds true today.The stock is pricey right now, and it may correct a little.  However, the long-term trend remains a positive incline.",2024-09-16
Only what 100X FCF? It’s overvalued even with the growth. I’d scoop in low $300s,2024-09-16
"VERY high price  (""F"" valuation on seeking alpha) and some insider selling.  Not a great time to buy this one.",2024-09-16
AXON is one of my favorite holdings in my growth portfolio.  It does not get a lot of press here on SA for some reason.  They have a moat.,2024-09-16
"Good thesis. The share price seems quite overstretched here. The company will always look a bit expensive at this stage of its growth, but the current levels seem to signal that another sharp pullback will arrive at some point. The challenge will be to buy when it comes.",2024-09-15
"CEO, John Barry, has made massive insider purchases of PSEC stock and equally stated, he is making a sh_tload of money in not only the management fess he gets, by owning the external management company (PCM - Prospect Capital Management ) that manages PSEC but also in the dividend income he receives from his purchases of PSEC stock - just massive income here.",2024-09-15
"@KEEPYOURMONEY  At the conference call he was rude - he presented the facts but even insulted those who disagreed or didnt understand.   This was two weeks or so ago.  The next couple of days he started a buying spree that has lasted all two weeks.   I wondered if he thought being rude would discourage investors, and make it cheaper for him to buy the several million shares.",2024-09-14
A thousand shares of DG for the Director is a drop in the bucket.,2024-09-14
"John Barry is very smart when it comes to investments  and running PSEC.         I tend to follow follow his purchases and have always done well .  He nets about $4,300,000 a month in dividends from PSEC and whenever you see an insider purchase and hold this many shares  again it is where my funds are going .",2024-09-14
