"@ESP equity research Do you know if Fidelity participates in this program?www.prospectstreet.com/...We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan (also known as a “DRIP”) that provides for reinvestment of our distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. Effective May 21, 2020, we made a change to our long-standing DRIP started in 2004: stockholders may now receive a number of newly-issued shares based on 95% of the market price of our common stock (providing a 5% pricing discount), a benefit to shareholders enrolled in our DRIP (provided their brokers participate), as described in further detail in the 8-K filed April 17, 2020.",2024-10-06
@Bekster which is a great incentive to keep PIKing as much interest as possible.,2024-10-06
@efims The monthly drip is at 5% discount to share price.,2024-10-06
"@efims BDC’s that trade below NAV are permitted to issue new equity through their DRIP program at a discount to NAV without shareholder approval.PSEC has been using this loophole for years, issuing new equity at 20-30-35% discounts to NAV.PSEC is the only BDC I know of that does this.It’s kind of an under the radar equity raise.In the last fiscal year PSEC issued over $60mm of new equity this way.This is of course dilutive to exiting shareholders.Did I mention PSEC gets paid based on AUM?",2024-10-06
"You pay 95% of market price in the DRIP program.  A bit more detail to it.  Refer to the investor home page for more details.  Even that discount will not be worth it in the end, IMO.",2024-10-06
Several people mentioned their DRIP policy. Could someone please elaborate. I assumed that DRIP is at market because PSEC is always at discount to NAV,2024-10-06
"@Steve Richter CFA You're right.A good stock to trade or invest in is a good investment target.A bad stock to trade or invest in is a bad investment target.There are a gazillion issuances out there.  Why other than an exotic thesis would anyone play this one?Someone wants a BDC?  You can achieve almost the same yield with cap appreciation and much, much lower risk.You want a trading vehicle?  Lots of better stocks.If it were not for my bizarre thesis which even I question I would choose something else myself for this portion of my portfolio.",2024-10-04
"@StillRunning Your success or failure in addition to my success or failure and everyone else's success or failure - as it relates to investment performance - ""is all about the price of entry - what someone paid,"" and about how long (time) one held the investment.Your 4 years of holding period - as you say/intimate - have been good ($) for you, thus far.As I stated, PSEC's history demonstrates that the longer one holds this investment the less compelling it is as an investment.  PSEC has had capital depreciation - not capital appreciation.  It has produced good income, but not stable income (2 dividend cuts in it's history - so far), and Steve Richter opines that PSEC will eventually have to reduce the dividend again - we shall see.",2024-10-04
"@StillRunning congrats.  As we touched in previously, you are using more of a trading approach. My thesis is focused on the fact that the management has not done a good job and as a result, value has been destroyed and it now looks like they may need to cut the dividend again.  The publicly reported numbers support that thesis.  Clearly, people have been able to make money on this stock and that is great.  For me, the risk involved to get the return, is not worth it.  My risk tolerance is lower than yours.  And, as it stands today, I believe the risk has greatly increased and the downside outweighs the upside.",2024-10-04
"@koleffstephan If you consider four years long term, it hasn't been terrible for me.  Had I bought a position and held it, my total return would be positive.  Had I bought a position and DRIPed, my total return would be even better.  I bought a position and changed the size of it when I thought it was the right thing to do and my total return has been outstanding.  I always maintained a position over the four years, I only changed the size of that position while receiving steady income the entire time.  I agree with Steve's analysis, but because of it, you can't conclude that PSEC has always been bad, is bad and will continue to be bad as some will suggest.  As always, it depends on when you get in, when you get out and what happens along the way.     I am a long term buyer and investor in a high yield portfolio.  Income is most important to me but I can't imagine buying and holding something forever.  Adjustments must always be made.  These investments are tools to be used and if you use the wrong end of the hammer, the nails don't go very deep.",2024-10-04
"@Code Talker Market Analysis Aren’t they also collecting fees on cash that they hold?If so, talk about taking advantage of their shareholders.",2024-10-03
"@Code Talker Market Analysis “Have you been buying increasing dollars on the way down"", to potemtially actualize or potentially monetize on your thesis one day?",2024-10-03
"@Steve Richter CFA This worked well on $FSC, which was terribly mismanaged.This worked well on $ALD, which was managed well -- but during the Great Recession.Someone with enough intestinal fortitude continues to buy at increasing dollar values on the way down until the BDC's management team is reassigned.At some point the assets are truly undervalued, and you are buying at pennies on the dollar, and -- if you are doing it right -- buying a lot.This can in some cases be a while after the dividend is cut altogether.So not for the faint of heart.BDCs are like the undead.  They never really die.  And when they spring back to life they do so in multiples.",2024-10-03
"@Code Talker Market Analysis I thought it was interesting.  Great incentive to PIK interest and ""grow assets"".",2024-10-03
"@Steve Fischer I am objective.  I own a decent % of my portfolio in this company.  My thesis is exotic, however.",2024-10-03
"@Steve Richter CFA Besides continuing to issue preferred shares and issuing common stock at the market (ATM) at stock prices below their purportedly stated NAV -which they have NOT done so far,  but they have asked and been given permission by their shareholders to do so, if needed - what other options would they have?",2024-10-03
"@Steve Fischer I answered ""your point"" - but I also ""added"" my opinion on the ""good or bad investment part.""",2024-10-03
"@StillRunning No doubt money can be made on PSEC by trading the stock - no different than any other stock - money can be made trading any stock.Performance for holding PSEC stock for the long term have been terrible.  As Steve Richter stated in his excellent article on PSEC, that one of PSEC's stated goals in it's prospectus of ""long term capital appreciation,"" is/has not only not been achieved - instead - it's long term capital depreciation.",2024-10-03
"@koleffstephan I get his perspective that he is buying $1 for $0.95 but to your point, in the grand scheme of things, it is dilutive for the whole of the group of common shareholders.  The bigger impact in the past few years came from the issuance of the preferred.  It will be interesting to see if that continues.  I am not sure what other sources they have to continue to fund the cash flow shortfall.  I know I need to stop focusing on cash flow so much since it is not really that important...  just kidding. ",2024-10-03
"@Steve Richter CFA Plus, the statement by ESP that ""the 5% monthly discount drip is very accretive to long term investors"" is complete nonsense.  PSEC's stock price is trading way below it's purported Net Asset Value (NAV) - so additional shares that the company issues to shareholders is DILUTIVE and NOT ACCRETIVE to PSEC shareholders.But, maybe I am a troll - but at least I am a  correct and truthful troll for stating the obvious.",2024-10-03
