"@piano-memo not so sure about that. Tafamadis tamps down TTR to a greater extent than acoramadis and switch tafamadis patients had an increase in disease protein. Said another way, it’s not clear that acoramadis is even on par with current 1L",2024-09-06
$Bbio is a 1L therapy which can be 7-8B$ revenue. It needs to be at 50-60$,2024-08-30
"@Puche I consider the near-term to be a few quarters, and less than a year.They will submit the sNDA before the end of 2024 and will use a priority review voucher. That should mean a six-month review, so, it is reasonably likely Amvuttra gets approved in June 2025. The positive here is that it is already available for polyneuropathy in the same population and many of these patients also have cardiomyopathy, so it is possible that we see better sales growth even before the launch as physicians prescribe to more patients that have both. That's how I see the pre-launch and launch dynamics, so, it is possible that better-than-expected sales as soon as in Q4 of this year push the stock higher the first half of 2025. But that's not the ""real stuff"" - the ability to promote ATTR CM on label in 2H 2025 is. Regarding the rest of the pipeline, it's expanding but is a bit dry on important catalysts during this period. Nothing comes close to the importance of HELIOS-B. That's the other reason that I mentioned in my article.In the end, we are dealing with probabilities, not certainties. I am definitely not excluding the possibility of ALNY trading higher during this period, but think it's more likely that it doesn't given the circumstances.",2024-08-30
"“I believe HELIOS-B's success is priced in at current levels and that further upside is limited in the near term.I remain a long-term bull on Alnylam based on its expanding and maturing RNAi pipeline.”Not sure about what your definition of near term is but you seem to imply it’s through the launch in late 2025.  I think the stock could be range bound for a few months but ALNY’s existing revenue producing drugs should deliver strong results. IMO its more likely that the stock slowly trends higher with the pipeline holding lots of excitement. I happen to agree with these two comments on a macro basis (see above). Hence, why I sold covered calls a week or so ago at much higher prices and sold naked put this morning at lower prices on the sell off. ALNY had tremendous potential goal and I expect the stock to be materially higher over the next 3-5 years. All just my two cents. Slow and steady. Good luck to all!",2024-08-30
