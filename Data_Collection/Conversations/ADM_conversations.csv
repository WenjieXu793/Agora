Made some money on a swing trade with ADM just after the accounting issue arose in January. Has that been resolved or SEC still investigating?,2024-10-03
"@thirdcamper ,   Recent ""Macro"" econ News-Bit, China is stimulating their econ/QE.  . . ,  Pick your fav Commodity b/c there is likely new orders from China in the making; also heard a similar comment on CNBC.@Paul Franke",2024-09-26
"@Paul Franke My base case is in the same camp but it is concerning that out of 93 billion of revenue they only end up with 4 billion of operational income. I know it is more complex, but it takes a lot of money to make a little ( billions are not a little lol) but the caveat is, the product is a necessity and should give them pricing power if inflation returns, which seems probable. Thank you.",2024-09-26
"ADM is a fine company, but has never been a satisfying hold for me.  Just seems to be better opportunities.",2024-09-24
"@Paul Franke Yes, especially MMCC driven anti agri policy like limiting agri  fertilzer or water  use or curtailing lifestock / acre could spur agri pricing counterveiling the factor I listed.",2024-09-24
"@DrWTP Got it, it's a ""work in progress""Still, I believe the area where this issue occurred was in the flavoring dept., which is a small percentage of the business.I think bottom line is that ADM makes for a good dividend growth investment.",2024-09-24
"@dondougie Not always. The valuation should allow it to rise some, even with flat grain prices. The company reinvests its profits to compound assets and earnings per share over time.",2024-09-24

"Thanks for an excellent update on ADM and also the many peer comps, Mr. Franke.I concur on inflation risk all across Former Free West. Their macro policy is too far out of whack, they printed way to much money and the path of least resistance is to inflate the imbalances away (and maybey less bad vs outright defaults).  ADM may be a very good bet here because it controls a big and vital value chain. Volatility may well be less vs bets on energy or materials (just look at what happened to the"" metal of the future"" LithiumADM and BG are both on my watchlist (I sold ADM a few months ago on ∆ valuation, but it is very favorable again as you say).Now BG is smaller but similiar and even lower on EV / Ebitda for instance. It might also be easier to take over (long shot but if...). Also the pending  sale of the Brazil ethanol business to JV partner BP might improve margins. So I am curious:Do you have an opinion on the relative value of the two? Traditionally ADM had a slight edge on BG, if I recall correctly, but due to their recent (overblown?) accounting scandal(et) ADM was taken down a few notches.As for ADM clearly their infrastructure is almost impossible to replicate and they can earn lots and lots of margins across the agri value chain. Sleep well at night stock.If we can replicate the run of the 70s I am not so sure-- population growth is much lower, and ~ zero outside Africa-- ADM is heavy on carbs on those are the new nutrition bogey man-- they earn lots of margins all over the value chain, but those margins are not stellar and hence cyclicality can hurt themLikely still a good bet, but maybe  not quite a to the moon one with 28% CAGR for a decade.Thanks again for your work and greetingsNIcklaas",2024-09-24

"@airlarr Yes, I own NTR and SEB. Looking to repurchase MOS. Many of my stories of late have an underlying inflation-hedge theme... oil & gas, gold/silver/platinum, industrial metals, food related names, some REITs, etc. should be part of a diversified portfolio. I have been buying lithium miners also, a basket of them. ALB, SGML, LAC for starters.",2024-09-24
"Paul Franke, SA should make your big picture outlook as required reading. I keep looking for advice, how to adjust a portfolio for our country's run away national debt!! I like your ideas. I assume you also like NTR, fertilizer? What do you think of buying EWA,  EPOL, EIRL, developed countries with lower debt vs gdp?  Please give us more ideas! Larry",2024-09-24
