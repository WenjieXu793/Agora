Pay attention now—EV charging money starting to flow:“ChargePoint gets awards for charging ports along California highways”SA,2024-09-20
@GetRealHere Agreed mostly we just bought EV w/out home charger.  Taking some getting used to but wife is charging hers at work which seems to work.  Anything outside 75 mile radius we are taking the ICE,2024-09-20
The big test will be keeping the charging cables from getting whacked off once they're installed.  Vehicle based cables seem to be the obvious solution.,2024-09-20
"So why is chargepoint up almost 10% today, Tuesday, Sept. 17th ?",2024-09-17
"CHPT’s numbers didn’t come as a surprise. Finnish charging station manufacturer Kempower has been struggling as well. After IPO their sp surged from ~8€ all the way to ~51€ in less than two years. Everything seemed to be going fine until it didn’t. Downhill started about a year ago and the stock trades currently at ~10€, so quite a drop. Revenue has been declining, order backlog shrinking and the layoffs are coming.The CEO of the company said that the installed base is growing but the gear is not coming from them but from clients’ inventory instead. This whole EV thing has been facing headwinds recently but I believe it’s only temporary. There’s the early enthusiasm, slowdown fallows but in the end, it will take over and somebody needs to provide the charging stations.In that light CHPT’s situation doesn’t actually look that bad in my view. Gross margins are improving and what I like the most is the fact that the subscription revenue keeps growing. I also like what they say about the fleet opportunity and that there are customers coming back to them since the competitor couldn’t live up to expectations. Add OPEX cuts into that and who knows, maybe we have a winning recipe. Instead of “sell” I would give CHPT a “hold” rating.",2024-09-10
