MOS has Milton hurricane issues... They have significant operations outside of Tampa,2024-10-08 11:23:43.473138
@RJJ1 Most likely no. It is too large target for $NTR or $CF,2024-09-27 00:00:00.000000
"I hold MOS as part of my thesis of food security...essential products.A long term hold on climate change accentuating droughts that make crops more reliant on fertilizer to withstand the stresses of heat and poor rainfall.  It is also part of my ""broken clock"" portfolio of basic need products which can spike at any time due to geo political or other black swan events.  By example...there was a commodity supercyle in June 2008 when the major exporter ... Morocco... had a logistic failure and couldn't sell for six months.  The demand for phosphates for the growing season caused MOS to trade up over $150.  This type of broken clock timing is a factor waiting to happen again...when? As to the analyst review... suggesting the Balance Sheet improvements as a solid rationale to buy is not reflective of the lower cash and higher debt positions.  Complementing a minor adjustment in the current ratio may have been an AI generated complement?   What is missing is commentary on expected agricultural prices based on this summer's weather patterns and expectations from the Nov election.  Also China as a buyer looking to their BRIC friends for food imports and Mexico soon to stop GMO corn imports from the US are not inconsequential to the MOS story.  I am long MOS, CF, and IPI.",2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
Slowly accumulating and will accelerate accumulation if price declines further.,2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
I will collect the dividend for a while until I break even.,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
10 years ago I bought a small position in MOS under near identical metrics as today. Now down 40% on the 10yr. With dividends I am about break even. There has been some ups and downs but overall it has not been a great investment. Might be good for income investors but they did make a severe dividend cut in 2017. Still has not fully recovered to original level. I will continue to hold but would not be a buyer. Thanks for your work on the article.,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
Mosaic: A Value Investor's DreamThat's what I thought 10 years ago when I bought a small position in MOS under near identical metrics as today. Now down 40% on the 10yr. With dividends I am about break even. There has been some ups and downs but overall it has not been a great investment. Might be good for income investors but they did make a severe dividend cut in 2017. Still has not fully recovered to original level. I will continue to hold but would not be a buyer.

"@Sane Man Thanks for pointing out NTR. Yes, more diversified than MOS, it even seems to offer crop insurance, but it is still in the doldrums like MOS, though it has lost less than MOS YTD, whereas CF seems the best among the fertilized segment and it is about even YTD.DE and AGM are also about even YTD.  So DE, AGM, CF are all good for steady two-way trading, whereas MOS certainly and NTR to a lesser extent better for one-way bets.All the best!",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"The double edged sword aspect is key. I own UAN, a nitrogen producing MLP that pays a variable, and very large dividend, for the same reason. When commodity prices soar every so often, wow.The good news for all producers is that corn and nitrogen-dependent grain prices are moving up, as are nitrogen and other fertilizer prices. While we will probably not see a 2022-level mania, Iâ€™m happy with a continued slow and steady and increase in grain prices / fertilizer prices to drive profitability of these NPK firms.",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"I agree that, measured by debt ratios, pay-out ratio, and dividend growth, MOS looks attractive.  And while it does business in a strategic asset, it is only one asset and a very narrow one at that subject to even prolonged periods of one-way volatility.  So the market participant must either trade it aggressively or get lucky and time a one-way bet. In the agricultural and food sector, then, I prefer DE, AGCO, AGM, and maybe KR, because they feature more diversified assets than MOS (especially AGM and KR) and a two-way and narrower range of volatility, making them easier to trade without worrying too much about a lucky guess on timing.",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"@contrarian@coalmine Also, Mosaic has global warehouses of finished and bulk product. Perhaps they can make up their Q2 production deficit with surplus product in storage? The corporate press release wasn't detailed.",2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
"In Q2 Mosaic produced 2.3 million tonnes of potash...so, a reduction of 200-300 thousand isn't a horror. Phosphate sales volumes were 1.7 million in Q2, so a deficit of production in the amount of 80K-110K, is barely significant. All in all, the management should fire a couple of executives and hire a few more electricians...but, that's just my humble opinion.",2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
Can anybody quantify this re: total revenues and eps? Thanks.,2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000

@Tyler Durden 42 I'm always buying too early. But market is not rational. I need to learn this simple axiom and stop buying falling knifes.,2024-09-10 00:00:00.000000
@Druvaciam Aleh Agreed.  I think at some point it becomes a buy though.,2024-09-10 00:00:00.000000
