"@Avalentine17 - thanks and yes, I think some investors get used to large company stock buybacks and hear consider a $1 billion buyback to be ""small potatoes"". Yet, as pointed out in the piece, in comparison to JBL's market-cap, it is a very significant buyback and - as shown in the graphic - continues the company's long run of reducing the outstanding share count and adding significant shareholder value by increasing the amount of free-cash-flow per share. I was actually right on the edge of upgrading to buy ... but thought I'd wait one more quarter to make sure they're back on track. Thanks for reading and have a great weekend!",2024-09-27
I'll take a 7% (buyback) yield any day. Especially if stock trades under 15 NTM PE.  Great article!,2024-09-27
JBL has been pummeled YTD. I'm looking forward to a nice bounce.,2024-09-14
