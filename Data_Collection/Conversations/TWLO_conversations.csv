"I think TWLO is still a good company with potential but still has the overhang of growing to fast hanging over it. I think Elastic would be an great acquisition, their products would fit perfectly together but I'm not sure how the markets would react to any new acquisitions. For now TWLO will stay on my watch list.",2024-10-03
"I think they get acquired (soon) by either META, GOOGL, AAPL, AMAZN.",2024-09-27
"Agreed. Makes sense. Caution is appropriate, which is why at the right times and prices I am prone to sell out of the money puts on TWLO.",2024-09-20
"""I do think that keeping the company rated a 'hold' is the most generous move that I can make.""Indeed very generous for Twilio.",2024-09-20
"hardly any growth, still after so many years no net profit and this combined with a relatively high valuation. Why bother to buy this stock. Only if you expect it will start growing 2 digits again and will be come finally profitable. Else there are many better stocks to buy",2024-09-20
I’ll buy risk vs reward. My buying is limited to 200 shares unless I’mConvinced. For this it’ll be about a $2500 purchase.,2024-09-18
"Thanks for the analysis. Agree the fundamentals are improving while the stock price has languished. There’s gotta be a reversion either in the fundamentals or the price, I’m banking on the latter.",2024-09-18
"Twilio is pretty strong with a solid and growing customer base, plus they are bringing in AI based service offerings",2024-09-18
"@BeatingTheJoneses ''Agree with your rating but continuing to hold.''Of course... It's important to give these things time, a lot of time, until it's absolutely obvious that $60 per share wasn't that interesting",2024-09-17
Agree with your rating but continuing to hold. Valuation and growth provides a strong margin of safety while giving 2 more years for the work they’re doing today to play out. I seem to have been wrong about the coiled-spring but still think there is some growth in the tank and optimistic about Segment. Shipchandler seems to be the right person in the maturing cycle of the business.,2024-09-17
Twilio is one of the market leaders. They work with most of the fortune 500 companies. Lot more room to grow.,2024-09-16
The price-to-cash ratio is so low that I couldn’t resist buying shares today.,2024-09-16
"Almost every second company is using twilio. $75+ short term, $100+ longer term",2024-09-13
