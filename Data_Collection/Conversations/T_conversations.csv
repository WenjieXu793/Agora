"Buy high, very high; sell low, very low.  This should be AT&T's motto.B O Z O org !",2024-10-06
@rjklend Maybe it was way over priced to begin with.Like most tech stocks,2024-10-06
"Interesting how Mastercard can keep the M&A going while visa gets sued for being too large and anti competitive when theres essentially no difference between V and MA.Which is why I hold both lol.This is the kinda news coverage I come here for SA.Facts and numbers regarding my companies.Sadly ""something something politics"" is what gets all the comments and engagement so this news will be quickly buried in favor of ragebait.Many such cases. Sad.",2024-10-06
"@lastdimeranch I've read a few posts from disgruntled T owners vowing to sell it off when it reaches some higher number.  Why wait if you have a better place to put your money for better returns now? You just continue to suffer high opportunity costs.My leaning is buy and hold because most of my long term money is for income.  Yet I watch all my investments weekly, review articles, and stay current with 10Q/10K.  If there is continued financial weakness I plan an exit strategy (which includes where to put the available cash).The real lesson here is a defined investment strategy.  Create one and use it.",2024-10-06
"@Quad 7 Capital Same here on T.  Sold it years ago in the $30s, stayed away, now back in this year in the $16 range.As for buy and hold with some trading, it depends on the company/stock.  We own MSFT around $30 and I've never traded it.  I'd like to hold my T position with the dividend for years.  But I will sell it if the financials turn south (again).",2024-10-06
"@CincinnatiRick While I like dividends, T should hold the dividend and focus on crushing debt and growing their core business. Maybe in 3 to 5 years they can talk about dividend increases then.",2024-10-06
"Yes, it's a ""dividend stock"" but I'm not at all sure about why the focus on dividend coverage. The payout ratio obviates that issue. The issue is what to do with the free cash flow and I vote for whatever will juice the prospects for capital gains. My sense is that intelligent and opportunistic management of the debt load is the way to go. Took a tax loss several years ago but I bought back in early this year with a 15 handle and now looking for this to end up in my ""step up in basis"" pile while still enjoying that nice payout.",2024-10-05
@steve1189 The debt is so insane... at $5 billion a year pay down it will take decades to pay it down...,2024-10-05
@CAVU Mark I love these long term holds. If you had to guess what your total annualized return was over those 3 decades I would be interested.Thanks!,2024-10-05
"To lazy to trade, approaching 30 years of buy and hold.  Working on a time machine so I can fix my mistakes.",2024-10-05
"@Quad 7 Capital right around that time the Saudi money was pouring in, and those who held, are extremely happy.",2024-10-05
"@deadhead213 AMD was a BAD BEAT play but not nearly at $2.5, you are a God among men",2024-10-04
"@Quad 7 Capital during the last 2 yrs, I added $T on the dips, got lucky, caught the bottom, and I’m very happy. I reinvest the dividend, each quarter, and that puts a smile on my face, investing in a company, that seems to be heading higher. Reminds me of when I owned $AMD, @2.50, thinking I was a genius when I sold at 60. $t, isn’t AMD, but, I do believe, within 18-24 months, $t is in the 28-35 range.",2024-10-04
"@deadhead213 well, we were long T for ages, dumped off years ago, shorted them for a time, then went big bull a year and half ago. Basically we make money where and when we can. We realize many buy and hold and that does work, but you have to add in SOME trading around the core position and options selling approaches at minimum. In our opinion, that’s what we do anyway.",2024-10-04
"Only two years ago $T only attracted negative articles. Many times they preached “ The sky is falling”, today, it’s great to see articles that understand, what many of us realized, that $T was slowly turning the ship, and right, what’s gone wrong. Management, doesn’t get enough credit for what they accomplished",2024-10-04
Keep the dividends coming since we are running on our trading profit! Wooooo,2024-10-04
"Pay down the debt - the dividend can be raised later. Not that anyone listens to anyone.Can you imagine the return if they dropped the debt to half of what it is now. The stock would be in the range of VZ, if not higher and the payout would be better.",2024-10-04
@deadhead213 2025 free cash flow will need to then be in the 19-20 billion range.,2024-10-04
"Within the next 18-24 months $T will conceivably, will be in the 28-30 range",2024-10-04
"Have had a full position at AT&T for years. When they were having all the troubles in 2020, I was too slow to unload and have been sitting on a “less than money market” return dividend waiting to get a chance to get my investment back. I hope they have a gang buster quarterly report, the market runs the stock up and I will unload the last of mine and never look back. Did learn a valuable lesson...so when Lumen started showing problems, I dumped them before their “crash” and at least saved that investment monies for better, greener pastures.",2024-10-04
