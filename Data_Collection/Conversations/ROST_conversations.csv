"@pakrolltide It might be pollyannish to say it out loud, but we either begin to ignore the onslaught of must-have or best-of lists, celebrity endorsers, and other nonsense, and strive for a simpler traditional holiday time, or our deficits and debts will do it to us.",2024-09-18
"@VoiceofSanitySometimes Update:  Mortgage report out this AM and refis up double digit % over last week and last year, while purchase mortgages up slightly week to week but still lower than last year.  Only a few weeks data so we need to see the broader trend, but certainly interesting and worth following.Could be good news for Christmas retail as consumers extend their debt, but we've seen this act before where homeowners over-extend themselves against their home equity....",2024-09-18

"@Stephen Nemo Is a 39% return on equity protected in a highly competitive industry? If the answer is yes, why? The other thing 9 times book and 23 times earnings reflects is optimism among investors besides you. If nothing lies ahead but sunshine and flowers, you may get away with this kind of investment.
