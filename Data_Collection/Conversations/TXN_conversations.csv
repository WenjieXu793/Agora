"@Guanacaste Gotta put the plants where the best-educated are for skilled-worker hiring purposes. Also, Oregon and California are bigtime chip production hubs. Arizona is a purple state, and you forgot to mention Texas and Utah (where TXN is building wafer fabs), which are both red states if I’m not mistaken.",2024-09-28
"The price is only too high if you base your valuation on today's situation.  Starting at the beginning of 2026, a huge shift to 300mm wafers will be available to TXN and they will take market share away from their peers in the analog/embedded space.  Even if total demand hasn't increased by then (and it will, the coming recession will be over or ending by then), they will take market share and TXN will increase profits.  The market looks ahead and in fact that's why TXN stock has already gone up this year despite continued short term deterioration in top and bottom line.  Because it is obvious the top and bottom lines will improve dramatically soon.",2024-09-28
"TXN peers are not INTC and TSM.  TXN peers are ADI, STM, and a few others, some in China.  What is true is the large cost savings increased 300mm production will bring and importantly the gain in market share in the analog/embedded space it will bring.  At least for a few years, the proportion and capacity that TXN has at 300mm will greatly exceed it's peers, allowing TXN to grab market share, at least from the non-Chinese peers.  China is a special case, I believe all non-Chinese companies will eventually be excluded from selling in China just as soon as China has any capability to produce comparable parts.  That is true regardless of production cost.  The CCP only cares about Chinese jobs and preserving their power.  Market economics is not important to them.  The only reason they have ever allowed western companies into China is to learn or steal technology so they can set up their own factories and produce for themselves, and export too if they can get away with that.",2024-09-28
"@VoiceofSanitySometimes , agreed but when has throwing hundreds of billions against a wall and hoping some sticks not been the way of fedgov? Big government is incapable of the efficient use of taxpayer dollars. That should be crystal clear to any adult who has been paying attention.",2024-09-27

@osv1 NASA has a presence in both Mississippi and Alabama.  There are a few smart people that work at NASA.And I can promise you that absolute dumbest people in Mississippi vote Democrat.  Ever been to the Delta?You will start to see corporations relocate to places that are right to work states.  Maybe that is why things are being built in Arizona.,2024-09-26
Intel reminds me of IBM decades ago when they were the largest and most profitable tech/ mainframe company in the market and completely missed the transition to the PC market . In addition they ultimately botched the PC / Lenovo deal. Too profitable and too big to fail is not possible and Intel reminds us of this valuable lesson. General Electric/ Jeff Immelt reminds me of this lesson as well. It is amazing what happens when you have the right leadership and culture starting from the top. Lastly Boeing is another example of one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world failing due to change in leadership and culture at the top. It started at Boeing when one of 3 Sr execs at G.E. reporting up to Welch lost out to Immelt in the race for the top position at G.E. and then was hired as CEO at Boeing. If I recall this may have been the beginning of Boeing outsourcing the manufacturing of all their millions of parts that go into a Boeing airplane.  Many many much smarter finance execs than I on these Alpha articles.  What was primary cause of these companies down falls? Wrong pick for CEO and then they packed board w their cronies or was it more complex than that. Interested in your thoughts. Respectfully. Mike,2024-09-26
Tsmc is producing processors in Arizona now. It is the first of 3 plants they have committed to. This is one example of the chips act helping America bring back tech manufacturing.,2024-09-26

@trentbridge The CHIPs Act has done NOTHING to displace Taiwan manufacturing.,2024-09-26
"@Elarotsap I guess having all the chips that run essential equipment being made in Taiwan isn't a concern.  Intel was awarded the CHIPS Act grant via the Secure Enclave program, which is designed to support advanced chip production for U.S. military and intelligence applications. It’s also intended to ensure access to a domestic supply chain of semiconductors for national security, according to a company release.",2024-09-26

Intel got the most and performed the worst. Giving $ with no strings attached is not the answer. At least give it to some cutting edge companies not some dumpster fire like Intel that is years behind.,2024-09-26
