"@John Alford I am surprised you were asked to remove the info about the short report from your post. I agree that the short report being fake is baked in as we have recovered to pre report levels, but I don't think the DOJ probe resolution is. I initiated my position after the crash, buying shares at 52, 59, and 74 giving me an average cost in the 60s. I am unlikely to be a long-time investor, but I do see a clear path to $135 where I will reconsider my holding based on operational results at that time.I think your concerns about the growth of the policy base are fair, and competitors such as Primerica are better performing. However, I think at today's valution, GL can deliver an average operational performance and the stock will move higher.Thanks for writing the article.",2024-09-14
"I always enjoy articles that bring up potential downside risks on a stock I own. However, this article does not present worthwhile information.Historical returns have no bearing on whether I should buy a stock today. Saying GL is a dog, so you shouldn't buy it is a foolish argument. MSFT in 2013 had done nothing in 13 years and was a tremendous opportunity.Because of the buybacks, we are going to have a strong beat and raise next quarter with an EPS for the quarter above $3.00. This puts the stock at less than 9x earnings which are growing at a good pace. GL historically trades closer to 12-15 earnings. The dividend yield does not impact investor's return. Buying back shares is much more tax efficient for shareholders as a return of capital. Especially at depressed prices because of the short report. Another upside is that this stock has been thoroughly combed over by thousands of analysts looking for fraud or misbehavior after the short report, and it has come out completely clean.And on the lack of catalysts point, we do have a major catalyst. If we get resolution on the DOJ probe, this stock has a straight shot back to all time highs.",2024-09-13
Having held GL since 2021 I was very confident in the quality of the company. I decided to add to my position on 4-11-24 during the Fuzzy Panda fiasco at $43. Turned out to be a very good move.,2024-09-13
"@kalu0003 I cite a few of them in the article, among them F&G Life. And those are just from the ""peers"" tab. Multi-line insurance companies that are also publicly traded like State Farm, Allstate and Progressive might also be worth a glance.",2024-09-13
"@John Alford:""Globe Life trails its peers and broader market indices in total return, making it a ""pass"" for investors"". Do you mind sharing these peers that are doing much better than GL. Thanks in advance.",2024-09-13
