"I think the problem with the valuation is the starting point of 1.1b fcf. This is an unusual trough earnings due to various factors described in their presentations and not reflective of their current earning power which is closer to double this. Therefore, if you double 176, you get an intrinsic value of 352. Even if some of this is implied in the above average 15% growth rate, I still think it isn't particularly mis-priced in the market in the 250 range..",2024-09-29
"Davidson doesn't know anything. I constantly seem them lower price targets after a stock does badly after many years. I think the extent of their research is to watch the stock price. Price goes down -> downgrade price. Price goes up -> upgrade price. Even an AI without one ounce of intelligence can play that algorithm. But to get paid millions  or tens of millions of dollars for such low value work, welcome to America!",2024-09-27
"I've held ADSK twice over the past few years, buying in April 2020 and selling a year later, then buying in May 2024 when it briefly went below $200 but I sold that position in July at $248. ADSK is a company with a strong moat, and buying for goals 3+ years away now might be a fine time, but I see it more as a hold or a sell over the next year. Not simply due to cyclicity but the disruption in software, AutoCAD's pricing policy is ripe for disruption and the viable contenders are slowly growing though ADSK has the best software by a significant margin, as that margin shrinks, so will their share though I think they will continue growing, just more slowly.",2024-09-26
