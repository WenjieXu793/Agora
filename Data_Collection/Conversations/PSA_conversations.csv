"@DividendKingVIII Thanks for the comment! But how about Reatly Income, ADC, ARE etc., they offer better yields and have more favorable return potential in my opinion",2024-09-06
Love this stock. Up big time since I bought it and I get $3/share dividend at the end of this month. They do not raise the dividend very often but it sure is good to have when it is time to pay the bills!,2024-09-06
I own CUBE! Itâ€™s the only self storage reit to hit an all time high after this rally on the dividend reinvested chart,2024-09-03
Domestic storage REITs are overpriced. I have recently bought Canadian and UK public storage REITs....like buying US storage REITS decades ago when they were priced low.,2024-09-03
