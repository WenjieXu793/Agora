@chimcentral New to this sector and looking at SBLK. What catalyst do you see for SBLK to triple in share price? How are earnings going to skyrocket? Thank you,2024-09-04
"my humble opinion, big mistake with sblk.  outside the fact that i own it :-) ....the expected operating earnings are due to skyrocket.  i wouldn't sell for anything until over $70.  i do like china, especially jd, bidu, pdd....but they are more a put selling situation.  ease into them slowly, at (probable) lower prices in the next 6 months to a year.  i have a sinking feeling there is going to be some political disruption in the china realm soon, just a guess.",2024-08-29
"@RenoGuy People look up 13F filings to see what super investors are doing.  Anyone with over 100M in assets needs to file a 13f 45 days after the quarter.  So that is where the info comes from when you see ""NAME buys xyz company"" stories.  You can get 13Fs off of the SEC website (Edgar) or use an aggregator like whalewisdom.comI look at 13Fs every quarter for about 20 large investors.  I only look at investors that manage concentrated portfolios like Bill Ackman that has 8-10 stocks.  Those investors need to make good decisions because they are not spray and pray investors.",2024-08-24
