"Interesting how Mastercard can keep the M&A going while visa gets sued for being too large and anti competitive when theres essentially no difference between V and MA.Which is why I hold both lol.This is the kinda news coverage I come here for SA.Facts and numbers regarding my companies.Sadly ""something something politics"" is what gets all the comments and engagement so this news will be quickly buried in favor of ragebait.Many such cases.
