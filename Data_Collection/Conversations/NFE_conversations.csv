So I summarize. NFE raises $400m by issuing 46m new shares at $8.50~ and then refinances the 2025 debt to 2029 with an interest rate of 12%. Good Takes off solvency issues for 2025BadIncreased Debt Interest,2024-10-08 12:08:26.262805
@Pierre Cappuccino I'm buying a few mid and long-term calls here on $NFE,2024-10-08 12:08:26.262805
"@grcinak If I remember correctly, these guys have been advertising NFE for several quarters already which means they are deeply underwater.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000

"@VIPstock I don’t really know. I just googled something like “new fortress 6.75% cusip”. If you know when it was issued you might find a free writing prospectus with the initial cusip on it, but I don’t think that works here. Fitch looks like it lists them too www.fitchratings.com/...",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
@houtex Again Thanks! Question is what's the most easiest way to find CUSIP of a Bond?For Example... I would like to check the Bond Price of  various bonds of INTC - Intel... Earlier on FINRA... it was allowing to check by entering Stock Ticker... but looks that it's not working any more!,2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
@VIPstock They called part of the bond a bit ago and had the cusips in there. 144a means it’s available only to some investors. I should have said “reg s” not registered.  Reg s allows the securities to be sold overseas.,2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"still a lot of woods to chop given the capex need and the very high interest expense. I am not buying here. The management needs to show results first, even if it means missing the first leg up.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
@jarratta I like the way you think. I agree with your thought here. Stock price is down 4x from less than a year ago so diluting by 30% is acceptable if it turns things around. Cash flow will bring more opportunities.,2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"@jarratta Great expertise, diluting common shareholders  by up to 35% at all-time lows. Kudos to management.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
@VIPstock The 144A cusip is 644393AA8 and the reg s cusip is U6422PAA6.  The notes are back up to around par now.,2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"@Risk21 you need to take into account that he owns more than 20% of the company. Thats almost half a billion , and much more at a higher share price. He did what he had to do to fix his mess. Hopefully they pay down debt over time with cash flows.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"@houtex url... you gave is asking to enter Look up Symbol or CUSIP,,, where to find CUSIP?I tried with NFE but that came out with many options and when click on one of the option... got wrong data.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"This is an astute, but expensive resolution that buys quite a bit of time.  It reflects the financing credibility and expertise of management.  If LNG starts flowing, it might be possible to refinance down the road.",2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
@Norman Bates at Disneyland I consider this a valid concern. Management is not likely to change its approach to managing investor expectations.,2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
Band aid… still to much debt even with $1bn plus of ebitda. The old notes which didn’t participate got primed but I guess the guys who participated will own the business.,2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000

"@sts66 Remember that sell-side analysts often cover certain industries and tend to issue positive ratings. For example, there has not been much to gain in the alternative energy space in recent years but if it is your job to cover companies like PLUG, BLDP, FCEL and NKLA, you don't have much of a chance to succeed.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
