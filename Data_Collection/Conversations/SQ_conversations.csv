"Thanks for the detailed overview. I’m in agreement with your summary. We will have to see how cashapps new shift in strategy plays out. While I raised an eye-brow over the announced exit of cash from international markets, I do understand why they did it.  Having tons of users, even actives doesn’t translate to a ton of bottom line profits because it’s low margin. So they’ve decided to instead vertically scale and attempt to drive much higher engagement + inflows per active within their current base by transitioning Cashapp into a neo bank.   That’s certainly the profit friendly approach in the mid term. I’m guessing there were other hurdles as well  in international markets around compliance that went into the decisions to exit.",2024-10-02
"Thanks for the coverage.  I too am bullish.  I thought your analysis was thin.  Specifically, it did cot mention the Square product.  In the last qtr that segment produced $931M in Gross Profit (up 15% y-o-y).  By comparison, Cash App Gross Profit was $1.3B (up 23% y-o-y).  Dorsey has big plans to bolster Square.You also failed to note that the company has a fed bank charter which I believe can be its key differentiator in the fintech space.  Mgmt finally seems poised to leverage this distinction.  No other company can offer insured deposits and lots of other banking products to its users in this space.",2024-10-02
@Siswati It's ease of use is unparalleled in my view.  On the feature set side. I'm not aware of other fin techs that have integrated BTC & stock purchases as seamlessly.  None offer insured deposits and a suite of loan products.  Having a federal bank charter is its big differentiator.  This is just begging to be exploited now.  It's taken forever.,2024-10-01
"@Cavenagh Research Sorry - I am non US  , can u please enlighten me what is is unique about that Cash App/what it provides to somebody in the US that they can’t get from the likes of a C or WFC",2024-09-30
"@Seeking Sharpe i can think of several reasons, all of which I disagree with, but they do exist- Bitcoin investments (there are many skeptics)- Recession fears (impacting SQ’s primary customer base)- Growing competition (a natural given how successful CashApp is)- Jack Dorsey (lol). He is a bit like Elon. eccentric = haters- Fintech in general has see multiples compress. not Square specific. think Adyen, Paypal- Execution risk. will Square effectively integrate the expensive Afterpay purchase ?",2024-09-29
@Seeking Sharpe fintech as a whole is beaten downEdit: I’ll add there is justifiably some hesitation around Dorsey’s leadership and probably some doubts about Block hitting estimates given the current macro environment that keep the stock from being awarded with a higher premium,2024-09-29
Stock is currently super cheap. Block likely hits $5/sh eps next year. If given a PE of 18 on that EPS number block’s share price would be 90/sh. And I’d argue a 18PE for a company growing gross profit  15-20% every year is quite cheap,2024-09-29
"@sho1 Thanks for the ADYEY tip.  I'll dig.  I think SQ could have a lot going for it.  No other pmt tech can provide banking (incl FDIC insured deposits, easy loans, etc).  It's a huge potential differentiator that hasn't been exploited nearly enough.  If you haven't downloaded the Cash app, check it out.  Execution here has been poor.  I like the new plan (the IR section provides access to Dorsey's cogent qtrly letters.  The first one sets the stage).  Now might be a great time to enter. My sleeper pick in the pmts space is MQ -- it labors in the bowels. It's somewhat long in the tooth '23 Investor Day presentation (investors.marqeta.com/...) provides a great overview of both the tech and the team.",2024-09-28
we are looking at an updated fair value estimate of $48.10.You should proofread your work before publishing it and learn more about Bitcoin. It's a big reason I own SQ.  $65k now at end of September as China and the US turn on the liquidity faucet.  Microstrategy - best performing large public stock over past 4 years - by a large margin.,2024-09-28
"@slow_trader I do not have SQ, knee deep on ADYEY. Why don't SQ get rid of their Bitcoin investment, I certain know very little of SQ, just starting to do DD yet.",2024-09-27
"@Natturner1966 Yeah, the payments stocks have finally staged their revival across the board.",2024-09-22
"@Rleaton # of users is what i mostly look at…might be regoinal but i can use venmo at a lot of places and square is sometimes used at farmers market i go to but those guys arent really using it anymore, they want me to use venmo or real paper cash…i just feel square is fizzling out…used to be everywhere…i think basically a creditcard processing terminal now…lots of comp…stripe, clover, etc…paypal seems to be building a better ecosystem",2024-09-16
@Leodavinci What gives you that impression? Generally curious. Casual had been outgrowing Venmo for a long time and has been making more gross profit than Venmo since 2023,2024-09-16
"@sjm- cfa I think people look at PayPal/Venmo and then block. Who is going to win? I think PayPal and Venmo are winning. They each have more users than cash app…. And they were both owned by the same company. I think the square app was really cool at first, I ordered one just for fun, but there are a lot of options now… I think use will decline in the near future.  I think investing in bitcoin was a clear sign of speculative management.",2024-09-16
"@Juxtaposed Ideas Thanks for the response.  I think SOFI aspires to be the premier digital bank in the nation.  I see no evidence that it is innovating in payment processing tech.Both sides of SQ's offering are growing and for the first time its leadership seems focused on exploiting is charter and integrating that differentiator in both Cash & SQ.  It's hard not to be skeptical.  There's been too much yoga and BTC fascination in the past.  My CB is in the 20's, but I still worry about execution.",2024-09-15
"@jarratta Great points. I believe SOFI is focusing more on lending/ digital bank prospects, as compared to SQ's payment services (though CashApp is growing rather well too).",2024-09-14
Five straight beat and raise quarters all while reorganizing the company. With all the pieces to the business this is a hard one to understand. Soon with the connection of the SQ and cash app ecosystems we should have a clearer picture of what the future will look like.,2024-09-13
I am pretty knee deep in SQ. You scare me.Cost basis around 50. Major position for me.,2024-09-12
"@Vladimir Dimitrov, CFA can you tell me where you got that recommendations graph with a plot of buys/sells/holds through time? I have Seeking Alpha premium, but I cannot find this anywhere. Thank you!",2024-09-11
"Solid note.SQ has pivoted from ""growth at any price"" to ""growth with profitability "".  This typically leads to a transition of the shareholder base from momentum-seekers to quality growth and/or GARP investors and may take a while longer for it to complete.Sentiment seems too focused on the past and not enough on the future.  Yes, the stock has been a disappointment over the last 5-6 years.  But look at the future opportunities.  Total revenues are expected to grow 10-11% in the next 2-3 years w/EPS up 20+%.  The balance sheet is strong, profitability is improving as is free cash flow.  Should the co. really execute against its plans, profitability has significant room to the upside as does valuation levels.There are some significant risks potential investors should consider.  A slowing macroeconomic environment could disproportionately put pressure on SQ's small business operators and their consumer-orientation.  I'm also a little weary of the BNPL market segment and potential credit hits.  Competition could be a bigger issue than I'm factoring on.  Must admit I don't ""get"" their bitcoin strategy.  Bottom line?  I've traded SQ a couple times.  Seems like it's time to do so again.  I'm currently under-represented in consumer, financials & technology and SQ fits in there somewhere.  At this point, not sure SQ is a trade or an investment.  Should they continue to execute against their plan and stabilize/improve their market share this could turn into a core holding.  Good luck to all.",2024-09-11
