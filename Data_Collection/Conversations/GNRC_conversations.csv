"**Take a look at this google trends data: Searches for “Generac” jumped to 82 after Hurricane Beryl in July, while Hurricane Helene peaked at 63.These are the second and tied for third highest spikes in the last five years, with the highest being the peak during the Texas winter power outage in February 2021. In quarters following each of these spikes, Generac has beaten EPS estimates by an average of 8.3% and exceeded revenue expectations by an average of about $8 million. With Hurricane Milton set to make landfall as a major hurricane on the west coast of Florida this Wednesday and Thursday, we can expect another widespread power outage event. Management has consistently guided for an additional $50 to $100 million in revenue generated from major outages. We’ve already experienced two significant events this year, and all signs indicate an imminent third. Looking forward to the Q3 earnings!**trends.google.com/...",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000

@DanOB DER programs  Distributed Energy Resources  found in nearly all utilites and cooperatives  are working with gensets as well as solar farms.. Gensets are outgunning solar farms in terms of GWs overall already.\,2024-09-29 00:00:00.000000
@Jeffrey Adams I think your lifespan estimate is too high. There is no way it will last 30 years without routine/heavy maintenance through the years. On a resale basis no one will rely on it if it's 20 years or more. I once sold them.,2024-09-29 00:00:00.000000
