"@I_Am_The_Walrus Wrong. Nike gave the reins to a McKinsey consultant who tried to bypass the Nike distribution network and sell direct to consumers. It looked great on paper, but that's not how Nike customers buy shoes.",2024-10-06
"People donâ€™t forget Nike stood behind months of burning, looting and mayhem.",2024-10-06
"@I_Am_The_Walrus yes, heard that before. I always thought they went woke in the early '90's. That's a gross over-simplification of their current channel marketing issues, but there is some truth to that. Unlike a Disney, i believe Nike can dig their way out of this with innovating products and restoring the confidence of the traditional retail channel.",2024-10-06
@Bill the Bag Man agree.  At a macro level the weekly summary that would be somewhat useful would be the number of companies that reported positive earnings growth or revenue growth net inflation.  Of which I think only CCL did.  Would need to check.  But otherwise not a very helpful metric.,2024-10-05
Do companies ever really guide earnings very high? No. They guide on the conservative cautious side. Usually that is why an equity tanks if they miss or guide lower. Nothing earth shattering and it is not saying much about the macro economic picture.,2024-10-05
"@Master Oogway MO, Nike years ahead of of UA. Don't follow VF. Nike and Adidas the giants in the athletic apparel and footwear game. UA tried but fell short.",2024-10-04
"While turnarounds are tough in this industry, Nike has the experience and deep pockets to weather it. Will be interesting to see how Nike navigates this. UA has so far failed. VF is in its early innings of turnaround, while the stock has got ahead of the turnaround story.",2024-10-04
"@TwoFranks disagree. Morningstar has a $124 ""fair value"" or intrinsic value estimate on the stock. My own model has a value closer to $85 - $90, but it's more earnings based, and what i do is average the two to get a reasonable valuation estimate for a stock and a company. You are speaking the obvious. After periods like this, is when you want to own good companies. Nike has been through this before. I could be wrong too.",2024-10-04
"They've kitchen-sinked guidance two quarters in a row.  There is no compelling reason to own NKE at this price.  It looks more and more like a flailing legacy stock a la BA, INTC, etc. every passing day.",2024-10-03
"@DrewMcVay Maybe it'll come a time when US companies are hated :D. There are some well loved euro stock like LVMH but I feel anything fashion/apparel is risky above 15PE even when they seem to do well. I think Adidas stock has recovered recently, no?I am terribly scared of bank and I stay away from those too, seems to randomly blow up every few years....",2024-10-03
"@very_new_at_this Adidas has less than a 10 P/E for awhile. Mainly because it's a euro stock and those are hated for whatever reasons people have, sell at extreme discounts to american companies.... but yeah, they make clothing and shoes, why would anyone think they were worth more than a 10 P/E? You have banks that make money for literally just existing, and they can't get above a 10 P/E despite the fact they make money with certainty.",2024-10-03
@ZeissGirls China is 13% - 15% of Nike total revenue. It's roughly 1/rd of EBIT. A recovering consumer in China with lower interest rates - all other things being equal - is probably a positive for Nike moving forward.,2024-10-03
"Agree it will take a few quarters to see the affects (new CEO, relationships with FL, Dicks, Etc. restored, SLT changes post new CEO joining and new waves of innovation) take place in the share price.  My guess is we start seeing it positively affect the share price no earlier than their Q3/Q4 25' report, but no later than Q1/Q2 26' report.  If we are entering Q3 26' report and the same results are being reported there might be a bigger problemThis one definitely requires patience.",2024-10-03
"@JordanTime yup, I agree there. Lebron and Jordan own tier, than Kobe in another tier.",2024-10-03
"I am quite pessimistic about Nike's prospects. A significant portion of its market is in China, and currently, this economy is entering a great depression. Most luxury goods are seeing a decline in revenue in China, and this trend is spreading to the middle-class market. Unless it can find alternative markets, the outlook is bleak.",2024-10-02
"@Batman163 agree with your comment. Nike got lost in their shift to online marketing and needs a new approach to both marketing and advertising. Simply paying pro athletes to wear their gear for free, or pay them huge contracts, doesn't work anymore. The sizzle is with Hoka, ON and New Balance.",2024-10-02
Nike -I have one pair of Nike shoes (Trainers) that I inherited from my brother.I wear them when I go out on the Town to impress the ladies.,2024-10-02
@Peter Jaworowski I personally would only consider NIKE in the $40 and below. I recall Adidas having near 10 PE at one point only a few years ago. Then again I generally don't like apparel so I would probably only get involved if it's somewhere in that low 10x (assuming no other issues such as INTC's massive debt)....,2024-10-02
"@very_new_at_this I agree, especially considering the declining sales.  This stock could easily trade back into the lower $70's.",2024-10-02
@DrewMcVay I wouldn't write Nike off so quickly.  Nike is still by far the best brand in sports and it's not even close.,2024-10-02
