"FV: $45. Take a position here, if you still believe in the fundamentals, but don’t buy too much. It seems like it has bottomed out, but there is no momentum. Set a stop below $55.",2024-09-26
Our CMG(s) locally - incredible flow of business. And you know the one’s that duck in for bags to go are using the Apps! Lol ,2024-09-26
Agree  we own more CAVA now than CMG but CMG  has had its pull back and can start the  nice share price incline  we all expect . Lets face it most CEOs these says are not the Captain of the ship as they used to be. Ships that large  are non stoppable no matter who is at the helm . Long CMG and CAVA  both are a retirement plan wrapped up in two stocks .,2024-09-25
"I very much enjoyed reading this thorough update on CMG, but your ""cautious"" upgrade to Buy seems to be a stretch, particularly in light of the following analysis by you: ""While it is undeniable that CMG remains expensive at FWD PEG non-GAAP ratio of 2.37x, elevated compared to the sector median of 1.47x though moderated from its 5Y mean of 2.87x, we believe that its premium valuations remain somewhat reasonable.""CMG might have pulled back somewhat, but not enough for me to buy this high-priced restaurant stock, particularly as we are this year experiencing a record number of bankruptcies in the restaurant sector. I have a consulting relationship with several non-publicly traded local restaurants, and many of them are struggling with higher food costs, higher rents and higher employee costs that are not always possible to pass on to the customers quickly, if at all.",2024-09-25
"Interesting analysis. I was in a Chipotle the other day for a veggie ‘meal of the day’ (huge portions). Not only did we wait on line, there was a constant line for the duration. My working thesis, born in part by CAVA  (bought at $40 sold at $119, for other reasons) is that fast casual will become more popular as sit-down restaurants are getting more expensive. Also, for many, a large midday lunch is a main meal for the day, just before 2019. After selling Cava I bought Chipotle at $53 for a short term trade, partly due to concerns raised above. I don’t do technical so articles like this do fill a void. Thank you",2024-09-25

@5ofDiamonds agreed. My cost basis is $5. I think it’s worth holding on too. Plenty of growth left,2024-09-24
"I am not selling $CMG in my life-time. My cost basis is $26. And it does matter. Once you latch on to a lower cost basis, you are better off keeping it  for certain businesses @Mike Zaccardi, CFA, CMT",2024-09-24

No more support from price hikes from inflation. Stock is in dire straits. Shrinkflation is keeping America hungry and reducing customer traffic.,2024-09-23
"A few years back I was a weekly patron of Chipotle.  I have been a customer for 20+ years and owned stock since it was in the pre-split $80 range.  Then Covid hit and commotion ensued.  In south Florida, I noticed the employees getting rude and the stores getting dirty.  I wrote several letters to Support, but never saw any improvement.  Now, I visit only monthly, either in Ohio or Florida, and the story has not changed -- apathetic workers, dirty restaurants (especially in food prep that I can see while in line), and never more than half a dozen people waiting to place orders.  I sold all of my shares at pre-split $2k, so obviously left a lot of money on the table.  I appreciate everything Mr. Niccol did, but there are many outstanding issues to resolve.  I remain on the side lines.I would ask other CMG investors how often they actually visit one of these restaurants?",2024-09-23
"@Stashley This isn't science. If there was a formula to calculate the exact fair multiple we'd all be rich (or poor?). However, there are anchors to rely upon.First, the S&P 500 is at around 22x. Typically, high quality companies with high growth prospects trade 2x the market.Second, Chipotle historically has been a good buy in the 40x range.Third, if you zoom out and look to the longer term, paying 40x today means you're paying around 25x for 2028, which would be undeniably cheap for a company that's growing this fast.So, nothing precise, but a combination of multiple rule of thumbs.",2024-09-22
"Please pardon my ignorance, but will you please explain why the high teens growth rate of EPS deserves a 40x P/E multiple? Is there a rule of thumb that says ""double the growth rate,"" or is there a precise formula, or what? Thanks in advance! Much appreciated.",2024-09-22
