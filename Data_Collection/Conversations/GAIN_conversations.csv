"@G-money1 Hey, thanks for mentioning that, I haven't seen any mention of it either. I just looked, $.70 paid 10/15, nice!",2024-10-03
"@G-money1 Hi, the Nth degree event (and subsequent special periodic dividend declaration of $0.70 per share) was covered on the subscriber side of the service (in our weekly BDC and mREIT newsletter). Scott",2024-10-02
@upnorthwi I’m with you on both. I purchased both at about the same time a couple of years ago. I’m surprised that the upcoming supplemental wasn’t mentioned. I will continue to hold.G,2024-10-02
"Love your articles.  Why do you think this RC makes a new low daily?  I’m up to about 100,000 shares.  Any thoughts would be appreciated Thx",2024-10-02
"@upnorthwi You're welcome.GAIN also had the recent exit of Nth Degree which was positive but it's a bit ""pricey"" right now. Regarding GLAD, unfortunately, that's not a stock I/we currently cover (low reader demand over the years). Scott",2024-10-02
"From the Gladstone suite I like GOODO preferred.  And for BDCs I think BXSL and GBDC are pretty solid.  May stay flat to slightly down as interest rates decline a bit further, but their businesses are sound and the dividends appears very safe.",2024-09-28
Are you aware of the supplemental dividend of  .70/share about to be paid shareholders ?,2024-09-28
I expect GAIN to have a pretty good run up on its price next week with people buying it up to its ex-dividend day to take advantage of that huge supplemental dividend of $0.70. That will be quite a pay day. Glad I’m long!,2024-09-28
Thanks for the article.  How does the recently announced special dividend ($0.70) factor into your analysis?,2024-09-28
"GAIN is paying a 70c special div in Oct, FYI.",2024-09-28
@Dividend Trapper_2 that I can get behind since it’s up $1.13 since they announced.,2024-09-26
This is just a pay date change to 10/15 if you read the press release....,2024-09-26
"@BIZUN1973 Yep, old news but guess a repeat will build more momentum in the stock.",2024-09-26
Just when I was losing some confidence in the distribution coverage. Nice. Much appreciated,2024-09-26
"They announced it on the 17th.  Thank you, SA for being slow on the uptake and it’s payable on 10/14/2024.",2024-09-26
"Roberts, thanks for the article.  GAIN seems to swing hard both ways because their bets are concentrated across a fairly small number of companies.  I was in heavy for the very large special at the end of last year.  I got out earlier this year after the troubling quarter that you have outlined.  I just got back in for the recently announced special and I will move back out once the price recovers to an appropriate level.  Lots to like here for sure.",2024-09-24
I really don't like when the NAV bounces around - I didn't sign up for that.,2024-09-24
"@Bogo46 Yes a lovely double up for me , got a few more at the 12.80 level before it jumped again.Cant complain, had this for years.",2024-09-24
@Olrob9 yup and share price has also recovered by the same amount of 0.70 since that special divi was announced on 9/17 too!,2024-09-24
"Nice article Robert’s. You can’t go wrong with any of the Gladstone's! Very long $GAIN and $GLAD, while enjoying my monthly divis. I even hold their REIT- $LAND. Not an ADC or an O, but it fills a totally different niche. G",2024-09-24
