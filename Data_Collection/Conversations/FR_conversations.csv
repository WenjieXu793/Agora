"@gss54 REXR is a strong pick as well. In terms of yields, they are noticeably lower than in the case of many (e.g.) retail/service-oriented REITs, mainly due to the higher valuation (P/FFO usually exceeding 20x, which is rarely the case for retail/service-oriented REITs). They are valued that highly due to their ability to substantially bump their rents upon marking to the market, which drives their financial performance. That's why they also record relatively high DPS growth, which somewhat compensates for the lower initial yield.Thanks for sharing, cheers!",2024-09-09
"Not nearly enough yield for my taste (under 3%). I would buy Rexford in this space over any other industrial REIT but it too, is stingy on the field front. Lotta folks don't like companies focused in CA (like Rexford) but there is a move in SoCal (Rexford's focus) to regulate new warehouse construction, which is great for them. The Ports of LA/LB drive huge volume through to the inland empire area, where Rexford is strong. If they paid a decent yield, I'd be all over them. Why is it, that the industrial REITs don't pay much yield?? PS. I do own WPC, now they they spin off their commercial portfolio and are more oriented towards industrial than ever before.",2024-09-08
"@Cash Flow Venue All are somewhat expensive, in my view. I'm not paying over 20 times for any of them. I trimmed EGP recently and would sell outright if it hit 200. PLD is a forever name",2024-09-08
"@Arimnestos PLD is my first industrial REIT and I intend to hold onto that :) TRNO seems quite expensive at the time, while EGP is a strong player indeed. Thank you for sharing your thoughts - always appreciated!",2024-09-08
"FR is a solid name in the space, though like many other reits, their management of the balance sheet was suboptimal during Zirp. Regardless, I think FR qualfies as a foundational reit candidate for the industrial sector, if one prefers a U.S. diversified focus. Long term, however, PLD is the better play, with the top complementary names being EGP, TRNO, and maybe REXR. Long PLD and EGP",2024-09-08
"@The Dividend Collectuh REXR is one of the best, certainly. Thank  you!",2024-09-08
Great article. I really like First Industrial. REXR is probably my favorite in the space currently.,2024-09-08
