@Bill the Bag Man agree.  At a macro level the weekly summary that would be somewhat useful would be the number of companies that reported positive earnings growth or revenue growth net inflation.  Of which I think only CCL did.  Would need to check.  But otherwise not a very helpful metric.,2024-10-05
Do companies ever really guide earnings very high? No. They guide on the conservative cautious side. Usually that is why an equity tanks if they miss or guide lower. Nothing earth shattering and it is not saying much about the macro economic picture.,2024-10-05
Wells has been buying back Billions of dollars in stock each year since there is no other outlet due to the cap.,2024-10-01
"Wells is a solid, “Too large to fail” bank. The “L” preffered is forever at 6% payout. Why not?",2024-10-01
"Let Wells Fargo out of the penalty box. By a long shot, this is not the same company it was when all the scandal broke out.",2024-09-26
"Would WFC's new management submit this plan if it did not expect serious, maybe favorable, consideration?",2024-09-26

"@techy46 Sounds like something a poor person would say, which begs the question why are you even on an investing site to begin with.  Cash has zero risk and earns over 5% which better than most stocks, any one whose not a fool would know that.",2024-09-24

It does seem as if this last proposal was written by the NY Fed. Doesn't look so good on Main Street.,2024-09-20
"Makes sense ... less capital = more odds of failure = more odds of FDIC payouts and capital raises. Of course FDIC would be peeved. Of course, the original Fed proposal was going to immediately put a whole bunch of banks underwater, illustrating just how fragile things are, so they couldn't do it.Stay far away from banking sector. Business risk is high and LT returns on bank stocks are uncompetitive anyway.My two cents. Make if it what you will :)",2024-09-20
Yeah..whata shame the Fed didn't work with Lehman Bros. in 2008....just saying...,2024-09-20
So they will keep buying back billion o f dollars of stock until the cap is lifted.,2024-09-19
