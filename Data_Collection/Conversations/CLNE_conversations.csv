"@G1949 - Every analyst projection I have read estimates growing revenues and shrinking quarterly losses until sometime mid-2025. Significant trucks should be on the road by June, at which point revenue from station sales and tax credits should increase substantially. Expectations are that CLNE will have sustainable cash flow and earnings from mid-2025 on. If penetration is 20% as cummins estimates, revenue should rise every quarter, barring a major recession or oil prices dropping to the 20s like they did during the first trump admin in 2018.",2024-09-23
"@G1949 Thanks for the follow-up. Cummins is one of those companies that got away from me. I've watched it since its stock was in the 130s, and with regret never bought any. Now it feels too expensive, but I still like the company and what it does, including developing engines that run on natural gas.",2024-09-23

"@WildWarriorNutrition this jb hunt deal is big. First large customer to buy Cummins nat gas engines for big rigs. More will follow suit here, stock is dirt cheap & like the ceo said, volume & net income can increase 10x with little to no increase in costs.",2024-09-23
Hopefully we'll see more large fleets test these out. Shippers are excellent candidates for this. Most shipping centers are heated by Natural gas and could easily install onsite refueling for their fleets. www.businesswire.com/...,2024-09-16
