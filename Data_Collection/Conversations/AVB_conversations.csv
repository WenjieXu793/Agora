"@Wwilliamss not really because I’ve owned it a long time.  Fact is they underpaid the dividend this year.  Compare them to EQR.  Ok, yes I am happy with their return, of course. But they have a ways to go to return to their all time high.",2024-09-21

"The author is correct.  AVB is a good company but overpriced.  Why buy a 3.02% AVB yield when you get insured CDs for 12 months from Marcus Goldman Sachs for 4.7%.  I did buy AVB at 167, it made sense to me there.  I sold it after many months at about $211 per share.  With dividend stocks, I say what premium do you get over the risk-free rate of return.  Here it is zero, except the stock price could keep going higher.  I doubt it as these prices have priced in several rate cuts already.",2024-09-10
