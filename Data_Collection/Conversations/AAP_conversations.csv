"@magnolius Yo.  Do yourself a favor and use SA's peer comparison function and plot AAP total return vs ORLY, AZO, and GPC... Duh!  Pick your timeframe 1 yr, 5 yr, 10 yr.  AAP is... has been... and WILL  continue to be a turd of an investment.  And, as far as your statement, ""This is not a hotel chain, I doubt people care so much about customer service.""  Wrong.  Period.  People who buy aftermarket retail auto parts are either local mechanic shops or individuals... who depend on getting the right part in a timely manner... so they can get their vehicle repaired or maintained.  In fact, very few aftermarket auto parts are kept in stock at individual retail stores.  So, they have to be ""ordered in.""  Customer service is what helps the customer get the right part in a timely manner.  So, customer service, parts delivery and parts quality are essential.  Period. Period. Period.The fact about AAP is that they fail, grossly fail, at supplying ""ordered parts"".  And, AAP stocks NOTHING not batteries, or oil, or filters, or other... That I can not buy from the auto section at Walmart at greatly reduced cost.Finally, I do think that when spending their money most people do ""care about customer service.""  In fact, I would go so far as to postulate that generally  ""customer service"" is foundational to future ""customer business.""Best of luck to you.  Respond if you wish, but, I am done with the conversation.  Muted.",2024-10-05
"Hit a 15 yr low today. Selling worldpac was a start to buy some time but they need to trim headcount via inefficiencies, lower performing stores. They need an efficient operator. The stock will bleed until margins improve quarter over quarter.  I would not have believed a $225 stock earning $10 per share 3 years ago tanked to sub $40 but here we are.",2024-10-02
"@Gadzman_33 nailed it... anyone buying AAP is insane.  Dead $, zombie co. The new CEO from HD has had over a year to turn things around with nothing but disaster to show for.  Why buy such POS when there's AZO & ORLY?  Keep adding long AZO/ORLY paired with short AAP makes sense and print $ till AAP goes belly up or big recession hits, either/or is 100% eventual certainty.",2024-10-01
Your $400 million estimate for EBITDA seems light as does your 6x multiple. Nobody in the M&A world uses EBITDAR.,2024-09-24
"Put some butter on the stock , it's toast ! Long ORLY  since 1993 IPO",2024-09-24
"AAP is a turnaround. No doubt about that. But think they have a good chance. Not they are going to get anywhere near AZO or ORLY and their 20%+ ebitda margins. But money might be made from AAP just going from terrible to bad. Their forecast ebitda margin appears around 5.5%. By getting it to near 6.5%, shares might fetch around $55 at a reasonable multiple. Think the new management can accomplish it. Appears making a start. Seems recently reorganized with US stores head now reporting directly to CEO. But turnarounds never assured. So small taste now and watching for improvement.",2024-09-24
"I agree AAP is a stinker.  As one who just spent a lot of $$$ on a vintage car restoration, ORLY and AZO... even GPC... provide much better quality and service than AAP.",2024-09-23
"I invested in AAP when new management came in and sold shortly thereafter because the early success signs were not there. Turnarounds take time and with many other attreactive investment options, I had little patience.  The sale of WorldPac bought management some runway. I will be watching to see if AAP can get on a path to recovery and may jump back in.  Thanks for your insights and analysis.",2024-09-20
"@MrD123 What happened in 2020/2021 was a huge spike in the DIY business due to lockdowns/work from home. That carried all the retailers to rev levels they had never seen before. Execution in 2022/2023/2024 has been awful vs. peers.Agree with you that auto retail is a great space to be as vehicles age. Invest in the winners in the space. There's no need to chase a stock just because its down a lot from where it was if your in it long term. As a trade, I don't have my head in the sand, something positive could happen with regard to acquisition, buyback etc...",2024-09-17
@EPD912 It's a pretty pessimistic take with some broad strokes. Clearly they underperformed in terms of margin and growth for a long time. But do we really need them to catch up to AZO to get back to $160s where they were in 2019/20? What happened to them between than and now that made them uninvestible? I liked everything they had to say on the call. If nothing else things should improve with just paying down some debt and buying back some shares. Between that and people pulling back on car expenses I can't help being optimistic at these levels.,2024-09-16
"@MrD123 ""More cash than ever to step up their game""Cash alone isn't going to be enough to improve logistics, inventory, pricing, delivery speed, local sales representation, loyalty programs,  etc. In the aftermarket commercial supply business, that is supplying repair shops with products needed to service vehicles in bays, the top 3 publicly traded retailers complete with thousands of independent WDs in all regions for share. Repair shop customers don't ""flip a switch"" on the vast majority of product lines they purchases from their suppliers. It's not just a price game, there are other factors like logistics, personal relationship, inventory availability, delivery speed, etc. etc. etc. For $AAP to ""fix"" that and gain share, it's going to take a whole lot more than cash. It's just not fixable in the short term, with the kicker being they need to execute just to keep the share they already have. This is why this company is un-investable if your thesis is straight turnaround. Is it possible they eventually are acquired? Sure. But most of these articles just focus on the financial metrics and valuation vs. peers.",2024-09-16
"@davenchop up 4% since then, and just getting started... 45$ by end of this week is what i see",2024-09-16
"Seems like this article gets written every couple of months with the central theme being: AAP stock is trading at such a discount to AZO and ORLY, it has to come back eventually! Then reality sets in and all the new investors can't understand why the stock price keeps falling. It's mainly because while AAP might be in the same ballpark on store count vs the other publicly traded auto part retailers, they are so far behind on logistics, pricing, & inventory vs. the entire aftermarket WDs suppliers that winning back share vs. everyone is almost impossible short of becoming irrational on price, and becoming irrational on price eats into the gross margins, and gross margins are already way behind competitors, and so and so on, becomes a vicious cycle.Yes, new management was installed and while they know what they have to do, actually executing it will be extremely difficult and time consuming. This stock is a strong sell even at this level.",2024-09-11
@Hubert Biagi Hope Boeing can survive without parts made in China. This could even threaten the CEO annual bonus.,2024-09-11
"@arok79 agree 100%.. i needed a new battery year ago and went to aap .. some scraggly employee installed it but turns out he did something wrong and when i went back very calmly and told them that the guy messed up  he looked at me and stated ""ive never seen this man before in my life"" which was comical since i had the receipt and his name was on it.. the point is im sure im not the only one who has had problems with aap and like others i just go somewhere else now.. 100% true",2024-09-10
