"Interesting how Mastercard can keep the M&A going while visa gets sued for being too large and anti competitive when theres essentially no difference between V and MA.Which is why I hold both lol.This is the kinda news coverage I come here for SA.Facts and numbers regarding my companies.Sadly ""something something politics"" is what gets all the comments and engagement so this news will be quickly buried in favor of ragebait.Many such cases. Sad.",2024-10-06
"A good start.  The next step should be to allow merchants to not accept certain high interchange cards.  Today, Visa/MC oligopolistic practices forbid merchants from only accepting certain visa/MC cards and therefore merchants are forced to bear higher interchange on certain cards.",2024-10-05
"@Blowback2 - The banks do in fact receive the majority of the interchange fees. However, the fees are assessed by MC/Visa and collected by Visa Yes, the banks control MC/Visa and the interchange pricing but it is MC/Visa that legally assesses the fees",2024-10-05
"@VictorN Personally, I just shop somewhere else. I think it's just another way to milk their customers. That said, this is a growing trend that IMO will impact the huge Visa and MC volume of transactions. Long term game changer.",2024-10-05
@esavela if so I would pay them cash. Let them handle the handling cost.,2024-10-04
"i love that cash back but hate the default 15% tip, even for takeout.",2024-10-04
Another fail by the MSM / CNBC/BLOOMBERG talking heads in that they give the banks a pass as it’s the BANKS that actually collect the majority of the fees…by far!,2024-10-04
"Another issue facing this stock is this new tendency for businesses to pass on the merchant fee directly to consumers. There are some restaurants in the area that have been doing this for a long time. But I recently took my Acura to the dealership for some maintenance and now even they are charging a 3% surcharge if you pay with Visa, MC, or Amex. This trend will eventually be a headwind for Visa.",2024-10-04
Good to see two great brands building a stronger partnership!,2024-10-01
Love to see AMZN in the bowels of pmt tech.,2024-09-30
"@nckadams no matter what it is or who assesses it, the consumer gets hit with it sooner or later.",2024-09-27
@kata We should FINE$ them per the Brussels example with our companies.,2024-09-27
There's going to be a cost associated with providing this new service to merchants. The big question is whether or not it will be cheaper than the V/MC swipe fee. That's unlikely until Wero builds a significant volume.,2024-09-27
"@Blowback2 Not just that, credit cards offer protection that debit and Walmart's ""pay-by-bank"" option do not. A neighbor's adult son had a debit-card skimmer/scammer pull thousands from a little used account (so he didn't notice it immediately), and the bank said there was nothing they could do. The money was gone. It's impossible to prove you yourself didn't take it and are now trying to scam the bank to ""reimburse"" you.My credit cards give increased warranty coverage on purchases, car rental insurance that allows me to decline that from the rental company, and assistance should the card get skimmed or stolen, etc.",2024-09-24
@johngonole no the store passes the cost into all consumers helping their margins.  Bottom line is the customer pays.  Remove the fee completely and the merchants will just pocket the difference.  Consumer will get nada.,2024-09-23
"@Sparkle0135 Far as privacy it is a long lost asset. Look yourself up on the internet you will be shocked how much information is out on you. I typically do not provide valid information. My sister was all bent out of shape about SPOKEO. They had her husbands name where they both work, kids names and even their dog.   I looked myself up. it says I'm 150 years old and have more money than Warren Buffet. Personal information. Your doctor has it all. People come and go. How many of the housewives in white jackets have access to YOUR personal information? How safe is it from hacking?Your budget. Most money is credit cards etc. Where does your money go.We should be able to ask the IRS rather than they wasting time and paper asking us..",2024-09-23
"@Natturner1966 It's not like the peanut gallery proles have de-mystified the future competitive force of ''wallets'' and the global Big Duopoly ($V, $MA) have not been able to. From retail to institutional to govt to international payments, these guys are spread like a giant squid. Their moat isn't only layers of technology but its their political power entrenched internationally, and then having farmed out the credit risk spreads inherent in the transactions to the banks/issuers.Under the GICS framework, the classification of $V and $MA was changed to ''Financial'' from ''Technology'' in the recent past. But V and MA are essentially tech companies that own payment enabling tech processes. Their risk arises from deglobalisation and diplomatic upending of the present trade and settlements order. Not much else.",2024-09-22
@dynx because with small transactions these are really high.  And they don't allow merchants to pass the cost onto just the consumers using the cards via cc surcharge.  Also that 2.9 percent is often larger than the profit margin on an item.  Fees are way way too high.,2024-09-22
"@Natturner1966 yes, but the smart people will not use bank debit cards to buy stuff.  Not worth the risk.  Cc are a nice buffer.  Even with my PayPal account I only link my credit cards.  Plus cc can have a limit.  Even in a worse case scenario I can only lose so much.",2024-09-22
"@jb2022 I'm not sure. I mean maybe people with bad credit will use this. Why would I hand out my bank info, increase my risk, and lower my cashback or return?Flip side - causes the credit card companies to add more incentives.",2024-09-21
