@Michael Del Monte Given the time it takes to develop a nuclear plant the activity in that endeavor would not be accretive for some time. I believe the growth acceleration will be in LNG exporting to Europe.,2024-10-04
"Despite the false narrative of trump and the republicans, as I have been writing on Seeking Alpha for a few years now: we live in a ""New Age of Energy Abundance"" and the U.S. is energy independent (by an estimated ~3 million boe/d) and is the #1 petroleum producer on the planet and the #1 LNG exporter on the planet. This is one reason the XLE Energy ETF is one of the worst performing sector ETFs over the past decade (if not the worst ...) and if it wasn't for Putin & Netanyahu's wars, the results would have been even worst, and likely significantly so. Meantime, note the American ""big-3"" (Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips) aren't making any significant investments in wind, solar, and battery backup capacity. As a result, they are increasingly ill-prepared for the 21st Century of electrification and they are increasingly contributing to global warming, and we saw the results of that with the horrific recent hurricane that laid waste to so much of the Southeastern U.S. and took more than 100 lives.There is no way the planet will stop burning up as long as the ""Big-3"" (little 3?) refused to invest some of their cash-flow directly into renewables. Further, the supposed ""carbon sequestration"" is a total disaster, ineffective, and waste of time, money, and resources. What a world!",2024-10-02
"@macman5543 They do not go into that granular with detail; however, I would expect the firm will grow capacity as we near the end of the decade. I do not anticipate nuclear to be a needle mover for some time.",2024-09-26
Do you think $BKR through their Reuter-Stokes branch have a space in the expanding Nuclear energy revival? Do they report how much that segment of their business makes them at all? If they can be apart of Nuclear on top of LNG and Hydrogen that would be another growth driver.,2024-09-26
