"I greatly appreciate your insights into Argentina stocks and the Argentina economyIt's such a perplexing country insofar as it is the 7th or 8th largest country in the world, with vast natural resources including farm land and fresh water, access to the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and other natural assets-- yet it seems in perpetual hyperinflation and recession or depression. Maybe that shows how socialism and corruption can ruin almost anything-- I don't have the ability to understand how it always punches so far below its weight.Do you follow CRESY or TEO?Thanks",2024-08-28
