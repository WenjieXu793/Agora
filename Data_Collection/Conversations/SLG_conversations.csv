"@nyc3053 Australia A large German website about stocks says about SLG:Pay-out profit distribution in percent:109 %Pay-out free CF distribution in percent:241,3 %Doesn't sound very good either, does it?",2024-09-30
"@nyc3053 Australia Realty Income is simply much more predictable. Although, in my opinion, the share price has also fallen far too much. That was not deserved. The price in October 2023 in particular was far too low. So the market went completely crazy. But Realty Income was also far too expensive in the summer of 2022, so the share price was too high.",2024-09-30
"@nyc3053 Australia Congratulations. Then you've done everything right at SLG. Anyone who had the share for exactly 10 years now had made a nice loss after inflation:10 Year Total Return: 10.25%A friend of mine lost a lot of money with this share. For me, this share is simply one thing. Completely unpredictable. It almost always does exactly the opposite of what you would actually expect. The constant dividend cuts also don't speak in favor of this stock.",2024-09-30
"@StevieCool I know for a fact that O and EPR would not have given me the ~184% capital gain that I've received from SLG in the just over 18 months that I've owned the shares. That does not count the cash dividends I've received for 9 months now, but does count the 9 drips I made in 2023. O is in a managed account that overall has done reasonably well for me, NOT my choice to buy it, however, that dog is still showing a LOSS and I've had a few shares of that rubbish longer than I've held SLG. O=28 shares. SLG=1,625 shares, very thankfully. EPR wouldn't be at 184% either, I can assure you.",2024-09-30
"@Beau Marshall That would be really crass if the interest rate were higher in 2025 than in 2024. I hadn't even thought about that. But it would be great if you could do the math. If possible, also with the calculation method. I still think much more of Realty Income and the EPR Reit. You can compare them with SLG. It would certainly be very interesting.",2024-09-29
"@StevieCool Most of SLG's debt, around 90% I think, is fixed rate, so the interest payments on that debt will be unaffected in the short term by the Fed lowering interest rates. They will see a small benefit from reduced payments on their floating interest rate debt, but it shouldn't make much of a difference to FFO. Additionally, even with the Fed cutting rates, they will likely stay above the levels seen at any time between the financial crisis and the start of the hiking cycle in 2022. That means fixed rate loans from this period that are being refinanced will be refinanced at a higher rate. Overall, I think SLG's combined interest rate might even go up slightly in 2025, though I haven't run the numbers.",2024-09-29
"@Woodrow79 Thanks, but it's a bit strange because interest rates in 2024 are or were much higher than in 2025. In 2025, interest rates are expected to fall again to around 3 percent. Then SLG's FFO should be better in 2025 than in 2024 or not?",2024-09-29
@StevieCool there was a significant benefit from cheap debt extinguishment that is unlikely to repeat. Resulted in something like $2 in additional FFO this year. So it is expected to revert back to just the core FFO going forward.,2024-09-28
Can someone explain why FFO is set to explode this year and then fall sharply again in 2025? What did SLG manage to do so well in 2024? @Beau Marshall,2024-09-28
"@sho1 Great points, sho, I appreciate your feedback and you make many good points as always. I just think that to go well past ""fair value"", SLG will need to perform in the way that I stated in my post. You are right though and no doubt if your points and others that haven't been raised come to fruition, SLG can achieve the status of a great Reit with a commensurate share price to go along with it. We'll have to see at Investor Day what Marc and senior management have planned for next year. I know they'll have solid plans. Concerning the casino proposal, like you, I give more credence to its importance than the author seemed to. Success for SLG in terms of winning the licence would absolutely boost its profile and give more options here. He pooh poohed this a bit and I thought his comment on the significance of this was weak. The upgrading of the Park Avenue spine and investments in other properties is important. I would like to see a few more purchases and we well might, the key here is ""location, location, location""!! It doesn't matter if the buildings are 'old' but the locations matter a great deal which SLG will get right. Another great point is getting the occupancy rates up to the 93% to 96% levels over the next three years. Expenses are virtually the same, but the extra revenue goes basically straight to the bottom line as you stated. To finish, I would also really like to see an incremental increase in the dividend rate for next year, I'm not expecting a huge rise and that's not the point, the point is about instilling further confidence in SLG by investors, a rise would also express confidence by management that they see a brighter future ahead as the Covid days continue to recede in the rear view mirror.",2024-09-21
"@nyc3053 Australia we are in the same boat fortunately. Should we jump ship, no. I have changed my thesis from here, same as you and author said, I agree totally. (1) We have ""just"" at the inflection point, turned the corner, the turn-around investment has just ended yet. Even as we write, SLG fund is part of the offensive, multiple summit location is offensive, so is the casino (I see benefits, office clients can move to other SLG assets or non-SLG, does not matter, it will reduce office supply, rent will go up for every landlord)SLG executives mentioned more than a few times in their calls, offensive.(2) Inflation, I posted yesterday... go back and read them, this is another tailwind, not from SLG new strategy, just a STRONG tailwind for hard assets holders me and you. (3) SLG will no longer be a net seller, will buy from SLG cash and credit line. I recall the smaller part of the fund could buy and own properties.(4) Over regulation in CA and NY both are bad, but SLG knows how to steer in NYC, less competitors, sort of a moat.(5) Margins will improve from high margin added businesses, e.g. summit, managing asset, etc. (5-b) increasing from 91.5% to 96% if we could, that 4.5% are all to the bottom line, same tax, same expenses. Do not underestimate that 4.5% and do not underestimate a 3% rent increase, these are huge. We do not need to burn our capital to acquire-develop-operate-dispose cycle, it is so much soft cost, time to completion, I am not even sure this is a good strategy. Restore old buildings is more profitable.And you might have forgotten, MOST of slg buildings have been upgraded, not even require for environmental upgrade like platinum LEED etc, review 2023 slides.I think SLG team just catch a breath, the best is yet to come. These are Manhattan oldies besties. Watch it, you have dividends which might even be increased soon.",2024-09-21
"@sho1 I also agree that this article is one of the best summations on SLG that I’ve read since I bought my shares in March of 2023. Interestingly, he took the time to reflect on SLG’s past performance and to be fair, it seems to have been in a relative decline since the 2015 to 2019 period especially in terms of many financial metrics. Of course, it still has some great assets, but his points about JV’s and the dilutive effect of those is very relevant. I know that SLG had to focus on “housekeeping” and that the pandemic caused huge disruption and dislocation for the company. However, the use of sales especially for assets that should be earning rental revenue and income for SLG is not sustainable long term. SLG is at heart a real estate company and yes, things like the debt fund and SUMMIT have relevance these days, but rental income is still “where it’s at”.The most significant and important point the author made is the need for SLG to develop a long term strategy for growth to reinvigorate the company and drive it forward back to the place that it held during the mid 2010’s. It’s not there just now and the share price reflects that. Absolutely, it was severely undervalued when you and I both initiated positions in the company and we have benefited greatly from this decision when most others would have said that we were crazy to buy the shares. However, share buying is about looking forward, we saw price dislocation here, and that’s what we did.Now, to get to the price targets you see going forward and to see this company become one of the greats in the REIT world, it must grow. It has to in terms of justifying your projections in terms of share pricing, it will have to be strategic, and will have to definitely go on offence. Sure, the market turnaround is helping here, but SLG cannot just depend on that with its current strategies if it wants to recapture past glories. Don’t think I’m now being negative all of a sudden, it’s probably priced pretty fairly right now, all things being equal. Further price appreciation, however, requires some major inputs from management, this Investor Day is very important, perhaps more important than last year’s was, investors will want to see some more meat on the bones.",2024-09-20
"@ding dong do you follow this stock since then 4/2023? It is easy to see why we got a x3 gainer here. A better question to ask is what made SLG to sink down to $19 and 27% short?The market is not always sane even majority voted to be as such (i.e. it is not a one day event or a week event). It stays low for a long long while, i.e. most good investors, good analysts, whatever we were then, sort of sided with the short grossly misread misjudge SLG.I did my DD as much as I could, decided to go against the tide, luck also played a role for those many investors bought near $20, I entered with huge allocation, I could have lost my shirt. I am not looking back, from here we have a winner going into 5-10 years future with smaller gain (I am fine, now is a different thesis), nothing can repeat like the past 18 months.",2024-09-20
@sho1 Thanks for reading! I hope to join you in holding long term - we will see what management says at the investor day.,2024-09-20
"@ding dong Hi there, yes that's right. It hit the bottom during the regional bank crisis as a lot of CRE loans are made by regional banks. Incidentally, that was a misplaced concern for SLG because its loans are with the big banks. Nonetheless, the Fed's actions meant it bottomed out, but it stayed in the low-mid twenties range until they did the 245 Park JV sale. The market was surprised a) that they were able to do it and b) that they did it without incurring a huge loss. So the stock went up nearly 20% that day and it's been off to the races since.",2024-09-20
"@MoStock3 @Beau Marshall Author has provided a very good analysis and thoroughly touches all key factors, I appreciate very much. I do believe the >15% CAGR to 2027 scenario, with about 3-6% dividend (FFO may increase), it is close to 20% CAGR which is very good for a long term hold to me. If Trump wins 2024, that will help NYC to gain back sanity from Wokeism.I am more optimistic about SLG, author has not touched is INFLATION factor. We have LTV about 50% now, many buildings are fully paid off with zero debts, 50% is x2 factor. America true inflation is not 3% as stated, also from 9% down to 3% only sound good in English. We need negative inflation numbers to bring the price back, and price is at its PEAK as long as inflation number remain 0.001% (positive). Owning real estate is inflation hedge, x2 leverage can only be better for SLG investors.Your $117 target, 2027 could well be $200 if Democrat (and Republican too) will continue printing money to give it away. $35T debt currently is unsustainable, GDP is not growing, and not in the future despite the AI productivity increase. Inequity will be wilder than ever. The more we print money to help the norm and bottom, the more the Manhattan riches will be richer. 270 Park $3B (actually maybe $4B) cost is almost like just a number. McDonald meal $5 to $7 is now $13-$14 in mid size town, $20 in NYC (?? I do not know, just guessing from CRE price).Fed will resume to neutral position, 3% interest rate goal, that will help SLG shortly. But this is not going to long last, I believe inflation is unstoppable. Dollar has not sink more than the little shrink lately, because all global center banks are as drunk as ours. Therefore I am just giving you my gut feeling (from experience and research of course, vision is from good guts feeling, LOL) holding SLG will have a x2 benefit than holding a residential single family real estate debt free in the next 10 years. And it is all in the senseless numbers, because  SLG $200/sh will do us not good if $100/meal from McDonald.Anyway, I do agree with everything you wrote. I like you using many supporting reports, not hand waving. But I can see myself holding at least 5 more years from here, or even longer.",2024-09-20
"I have been wondering what caused SLG to turn in Apr/23. Why was that the low? What event happened around then that caused the turnaround? I can only think of the Fed's BTFP window, and all the extra liquidity pumped by the Fed into the economy through that program.",2024-09-20
As someone that is in the NYC construction industry the market actually shifted at the start of COVID as very few new office towers have started since then.  The numbers coming online you mention are majority of projects that started probably pre covid and are slated to finish up this year or next like 270 Park Avenue.  At the moment no new office tower cranes are up in NY and we don’t expect that to happen until roughly 2026.,2024-09-20
"Hello @nyc3053 Australia , we had passed $70 ... today back down a bit, it is only some noise level change. I think SLG is moving out of bad sentiment the street had on them. Shorts also come down to 15%, should be lower. I have high hope, high targets for SLG.",2024-09-18
SPG will cruise past all time high then do a forward stock split,2024-09-17
