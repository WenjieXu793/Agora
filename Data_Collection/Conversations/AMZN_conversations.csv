"@Fred S. Fraenkel I don't think it necessarily has to ""take Google down"". An alternative narrative is a fragmentation of Search ceding share to Amazon, IG, TT, Bing etc. Also, their ability to monetise search is dependent on their ability to collect data from Maps, Chrome, Gmail, etc. So what does a break up do to the ROI for advertisers? A decline in ROI may see adds shift to other platforms. I think the break up scenario would dramatically impact their ability to target and each % of market share they lose is around a $2B hit to revenue. Im a shareholder, but I think the risks are underplayed by the market in general.",2024-10-06
I use Duckduckgo for some things and AI for others.I haven't used a Google adware product in a long time.,2024-10-06
@Non-GAAP Earnings I'm a huge perplexity fan. It's great for researching stuff. But it will never replace Google,2024-10-06
"AI is totally dependent on data being structured and complete. And reasonably curated over time. Outside of some niche data, who has the most structured and complete data? Google.",2024-10-06
"Nothing but Google can compete with Google but the quality of the search results has really gone down dramatically over the past few Years so how AI from Google plans to ""arrest"" this would be nice to know...if at all as The AI has already proved out quite the reputation for being crazy fickle doing seemingly impossible such as fully autonomous drive to the point where a breakthrough into a full on robo taxi may very well be imminent but trying to cook dinner is harder now than ever. I still think voice assistants is the holy grail for The AI tho so remain closely wedded to Apple and Amazon as the two clear leaders in voice going on forever now. Scheduling apps could be another one as well which presumably great favors Microsoft given their Outlook e-mail system which I don't know anybody who uses Outlook as a daily driver as $msft is not in mobile. This sure isn't true of Gmail tho nor oddly enough of AOL which might be revived brought back to life as You've Got Mail becomes far more than that suddenly. The AI most definitely is ""there"" but ""not there"" at the same time if that makes sense. Clearly those in mobile and logistics benefit the most Apple, Amazon, Tesla and Corporate/Medical raw data crunching $msft and $orcl Oracle don't really know what to say about Meta/Facebook can't stand the business but the equity performance has been crazy insane good so something clearly going on there and is part of an AI ""arms race."" As a business that provides an interface instead of an annoyance don't see how Facebook isn't the latter still tho as opposed to Tesla and former Twitter/X where the latter is clearly trying to push into mobile hand held devices maybe through the creation of an AI driven handheld vehicle ""remote control"" that currently the global automotive industry has done nothing with that for decades now.

"To take Google down first you have to be good at search.  I’ve constantly tried Bing in Edge vs Google in Chrome on a wide array of searches.  Not even close, Google outcomes are order of magnitude better.",2024-10-06
@Non-GAAP Earnings Try Gemini I have found myself using Google less and less.,2024-10-06
"Google search dropping to 50% by next year? Doubt it. What have they lost 1% this year? I still Google everything, and Gemini is fantastic. I don't see perplexity becoming a verb anytime soon.",2024-10-06
"@Alex Mcpherson OpenAI. The main thing is to use Google as your backup for any facts that ChatGPT gives you, because it makes stuff up sometimes.",2024-10-06
"Search is one of those winner-take-all businesses. In the end, I am afraid Google will still dominate.",2024-10-06
AMZN should be deeply concerned about Temu and Shein as well as the logistics network that Walmart now provides.  More people are going to question whether Prime subscription is really worth the 40% more cost than Plus.,2024-10-06
"Google's Gemini may overtake traditional Google search, but most likely it will hybridize in a very convenient, low friction way.",2024-10-06
Google.  Just feels like they were on third base and cannot score.  Can someone shake that place up?,2024-10-06
"“Of course that pursuit of ad dollars will further ramp up the already huge demand for AI processing power, benefiting chip companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Taiwan Semi (TSM) and ASML (ASML)”Agreed! In the semiconductors industry, demand largely exceeds the supply, $NVDA and $TSM are the clear winners, the 2 best large-cap stocks, hands down!",2024-10-06
Doesn't perplexity use Google on the back end for its inquiries?,2024-10-06
This is why I had no choice but to add to my position in FNGU during the nice dips in August & September!,2024-10-06
"So smart to buy Nvda now at only $3T. What can go wrong at this time, even more competition than they're already facing today?",2024-10-05
@combatcorpsmanVN they need to retain mind share with garbage competition like Temu attempting to outspend them advertising to people looking for the lowest prices on the worst quality products. AWS is doing fine though MS has really gotten it together with Azure while Google cloud has their thumbs up their collective exits.,2024-10-04
"As an Amazon shareholder, I want to let the company know that I absolutely love paying for commercials during Thursday night football. Apparently Amazon isn’t doing as well as they claim to be when they have to screw people paying for cable forcing him to watch commercials because Bezos and his replacement aren’t making enough money. It’s really be. S.!",2024-10-04
"NVDA will continue plodding along, & then one morning it will suddenly surge to over 20% while the bears will be in denial & make up more excuses as to why they were wrong about their dismal predictions.",2024-10-04
