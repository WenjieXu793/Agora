@David RG Thanks for sharing the data! It tells a lot but we will see its result soon in the next report.,2024-10-05
"@Tamas Sandor I cannot link it, but the data summary is - KHC brands at retail (according to Nielsen Scan data not Circana) are down 3.8% over the last 12 weeks and 4.9% over the latest 4 weeks ending 9/7. Volume are down 5.3% and 6.2% respectively. Kraft Heinz is the worst performer among the major packaged food companies.",2024-10-04
This company is circling the drain. I just saw the Circana data and they will be reporting declining revenues in the coming quarter now that there is no more opportunity to increase prices. They have too many lousy brands.Note that Planters (sold to Hormel) and Philadelphia internationally (Mondelez kept) are not KHC brands.,2024-10-04
"@southbuckeye Exactly such a company, accurate valuation, its price is in a much narrower range than most companies, but apart from that, the price you buy from this company is also important.",2024-10-04
"KHC is kind of like a good yielding bond, but it may grow quite slowly in price. If yields fall further, as expected, KHC's dividend yield should attract buyers. I'd rate the stock a buy for those mostly interested in yield as opposed to growth. The vast majority of U.S. households have a KHC product on their shelves or in their refrigerator. It is kind of the king of ""staple"" stocks.",2024-10-03
"@DanTheMan1984 High dividend yield means a lot in the long run, but this is about the level at which I would certainly consider selling and look for other stocks with a higher return potential.",2024-10-03
@Tamas Sandor unfortunately around 40 per share however I have owned since 2017 so if you add in dividends I’m probably closer to 30 on a dollar cost average.,2024-10-03
What’s amazing is the heir apparent to Warren Buffett is on their board and he obviously can’t figure out what to do to move the stock price higher.,2024-09-29
"@Harold Goldmeier Finally sold close to 36 because the stock seemed like it was breaking down, and because I had some good bonds to invest in.",2024-09-21
"Mondelez is gouging their consumers so bad I won't buy any of their products anymore. One example is Cliff Bars- they shrank them from 3.25 ounces to 2.25 and removed one bar from the box and raised the price. I used to buy a box every time I shopped, when they shrunk them I stopped buying them and that was before they reduced the count. I will not let myself get screwed at the grocery store, f them. It's not that I can't afford it but 40 percent inflation since 2020 at least. One canned item I buy just went up 6 percent after it went up 50 percent since 2020- the mfr's in DC looting us blind deserve gallows.",2024-09-21
So is it a buy or hold help me out….,2024-09-21
I've held KHC since 2017 & have been selling at a 50% loss. What a loser this has been.,2024-09-16
I am not looking for growth. I am trying to figure out which companies will pay some type of dividend in the next downturn.,2024-09-16
They were doing the right thing by paying down LT debt until 2023. I don't know what happened but I hope they start again to pay down debt in 2024.,2024-09-16
"They have too many weak brands in poor trending categories. However, I suggest that Kraft was a bad buy from the moment they were spun off from Mondelez (legacy Kraft) and not due to the merger.",2024-09-16
"@Triple O.G. Investments They don't have a huge moat, which is why they have been in decline since being spunn off from Mondelez. Just compare the difference in returns between KHC and MDLZ and you'll clearly See where the moat lies.Buffet makes mistakes, like he did with the original Berkshire acquisition. It doesn't make him less awesome.",2024-09-16
"You know who else holds KHC? Thats right, the mighty Sir Dr. Warren Buffet, the most sucsessfull investor of all time, holds $KHC. If you're thinking about selling, or not buying, aks yourselves this, do we know more about investing then the greatest investor of all time? He also always said: Dont over complicate things, just buy great products, that have a huge MOAT and are loved by everyone. Point in Case: Kraft Heinz.Who doesnt love delicious Oscar Meyer Werners, covered in thick layers of velveeta, know as liquid Gold for a reason, and drenched in gratious amounts oh Heinz Ketchup, mmmm, exquisite! When we meet friends, we are most of the time treated to a delicious mac and Cheese meal, nothing more all-american than that. Whats that one Thing every one seems to have for Dessert, what ervery body crave?? Thats right, Jell'o!!! Jell'O is about family. What do you do before you gon to work? Nothing beats the all american taste of maxwell house, the very same coffee that our forefathers drank before THEY went to work. Its the stuff that make you feel nice and fuzzy inside, like your Favorite Sweater on a cozy sunday morning. Lastly, could someone please pass us the kool aid? We love drinking the kool aid!So, while ""modern"" investors are chasing pie in the sky stocks like Apple, Meta and Nividia, that sell ficticious products and invisible profits, these ""investors"" are basically counting their eggs before they evan cull their chickens. Stocks like this are all fugaze, its hot air that will come crashing down back to earth, just like during the dotcom.com bubble. Dinosaurs, like us, we care about old-fashioned, crazy things like tangible book value, iconic brands with huge MOATS (case in points: Kraft Heinz). Hope that helps, all the best,.....TOGI~!",2024-09-16
