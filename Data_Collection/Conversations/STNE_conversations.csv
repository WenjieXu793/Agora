"@Roman Vitasek, CFA Thanks for the answer.. But it is not a huge advantage to already have such a strong position in their acquiring bussines for developing and growing their credit book? They have already almost 4 million customers, valuable information about their transactions and I think more than 2 million banks accounts already. I think they should be able to grow this profitable vertical very fast to a large number, even if they never make it to the size of NU or Mercado Pago.. Time will tell",2024-10-02
@Kg222 I bought 2 years ago in the 7s...have not sold any and will probably buy another slug if this gets back into the 10s or high 9s.Also considering PAGS just because these two have consistently traded together since I started watching 2+ years ago. The share prices and market caps have been pretty comparable. Any time either gets much higher or lower than the other they seem to eventually trade back towards eachother.Would have been a phenomenal pair trade for the last several years to always buy the lower priced one and sell the higher priced one until the share prices equalized and then reverse the trade when the prices crossed the other way.,2024-10-01
After the announcement that STNE is exploring the sale of Linx I can’t help but think that maybe they are considering a merger with Pagseguro. To me it would make a lot of sense especially with PAGS trading <$3B market cap. $1.5B Cash + $2.5B of STNE stock probably gets it done.,2024-09-28
After the announcement that STNE is exploring the sale of Lynx I can’t help but think that maybe they are considering a merger with Pagseguro. To me it would make a lot of sense especially with PAGS trading <$4B market cap. $2B Cash + $4B of STNE stock probably gets it done.,2024-09-27
@Kg222 waiting for ages now to get out with a cost base of 25. I want at least 16 to pull the trigger.,2024-09-27
"@MikeFromNZ I am afraid that Stone will need proceeds from selling Linx to compete with PAGS and other payment acquirers to defent its market share. Additionally, to develop their banking business, Stone will need a lot of capital. I don't think that stockholders would directly profit from selling of Linx, but that's only my opinion.",2024-09-27
"Thanks for the great article. Very interesting views about poor capital allocation from previous management. However, I still see them gaining market share in payments, ramping up their credit business which looks very profitable and increasing margins. I understand the concerns about competition, but   don´t you think there is enough space for STNE, NU and MELI to live together in the Brazilan market? I think all these fintechs are eating BRADESCO´s , CIELO´s and other traditional financial institutions lunchs. But I would really apreciate  other contrarian views to mine.",2024-09-27
Thanks for the article and for the links to the Brazilian press stories!  It sounds like you think a Linx sale would be perceived by the market a net negative given the likely write-down?  What do you think STNE would do with the proceeds?  Buy back stock?,2024-09-25
"Excellent article. Growth, without profitability, is often a cecipe for grief.",2024-09-25
"Thanks for the analysis. You have a very conservative target and think a 20% gain within 12 months is highly likely. My target price is FY2025 12x which accounts for the growth rate and lower multiple due to international and banking. I got lucky and sold 2/3rds of my position at $18 because of the exit of the founder. I only want founder-led growth stocks, with the exception of $STNE and $TWLO (both due to departing founders after my purchase) are the only growth stocks that isn’t.Long $STNE at $8.33 unit cost.",2024-09-24
"@Halfdayfree  STNE is a dumpster fire, completely unstable as a company in an unstable country.    But it could very well follow pags to around $9.  Lulu is a terrible leader pumping money into the country, and you wonder why inflation was high - ring a bell... the rates went up just after he lowered them 3 months ago.  Doesn't matter for this company when the rates went down the company dropped and when the rates went up the company drops.  No one wants to own this train wreck.",2024-09-20
