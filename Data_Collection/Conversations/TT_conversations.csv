"Thanks Hunter!  I used to work for a small residential, light commercial, Trane dealer.  Loved the products then and so did my customers. They offer everything from basic systems to high efficiency, dual fuel. Of course, the residential market is moving to mini splits and Trane has a tie-up with Mitsubishi (highest quality).I own some shares, I will continue to build the position. If you are ever in the market look at their XV-20i or maybe their new line. Quiet, never know itâ€™s on, temp stays within 1 degree, and humidity control down to ~50%.  Trane is cheapest overall, due to the long life. More upfront, but 15-20 year life with little repair.",2024-09-07
