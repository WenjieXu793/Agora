fwiw. stopped out of AMT long as the amt/spy pair went from near 2 sigma cheap in april to august and sepember (double top) and has rolled over now trading near fair value (1yr horizon).. on absolute basis close below 227.93 was first indication ... close below 218.06 confirms.,2024-10-04

"I like TV's article, good analysis.  I try to buy low... I bought AMT at $225  because the stock is down, US economy is strong.  I'm not an expert on AMT, I like to buy dips.",2024-10-04
"I do not argue that paying today 22x is much less appealing than paying 20x in 2010s. However saying it became no growth company is incorrect in my opinion. That would mean that there will be not much need to densify networks in the future, wouldn't it? We have been recently in a downcycle when it comes to investments driving cell towers growth - sure. But is it the end of the game? Carriers are poorly capitalized and slowed downed investments, but the need to improve networks is real. Someone with funds will step in and make those investments to enable further digitalization of the society.",2024-09-27
"Any chance you've done a review of CCI TV?  I saw Rida's comments last week, but I'm interested in your perspective on CCI if you've studied it at all.",2024-09-23

"@SECMBS TLT is also down. I suspect the markets think Fed is going soft in fighting inflation, hence long term rates drifted up.",2024-09-23
"@NorthZorro I mean a couple years ago, the stock was really growing fast, driven by strong secular trends and the era of easy money, but thatâ€™s no longer the case. Most institutional/hedge fund investors are now heavily dumping the stock, and it will no longer command a high valuation multiple. The stock is undergoing a rerating, and any pricing based on historical averages is now unreliable.",2024-09-22
@The ROE Rocketeer I never understood why AMT commanded such a high multiple a few years ago. People were trading it like a growth stock rather than a REIT.,2024-09-22
"@Steve Fischer PSEC total return last 10 years 75%. ARCC 230%, MAIN 249%, HTGC 272%. Do your research. Quality matters.",2024-09-22
@Arimnestos 110% agree.  Forced to deleverage like the India assets because they had to.   Mngt?  have been trimming also.,2024-09-22
"@Gordon90 ""a solid management team"" I guess I'm much more ambivalent on the quality of AMT management. Which is why I have already trimmed and may well trim again soon. Like many other capital intensive names (reits, utes, midstream, etc.) IMO, AMT really mismanaged their balance sheet during the zero-interest era. They borrowed too short and with too much variable rate debt; they were greedy and short sighted. IIRC, they have been working to rectify those decisions, but it still gives me pause.",2024-09-22
"I think a 20-22X multiple premium is fair at this time, given (i) this is the industry leader, (ii) it has a solid management team, (iii) benefits from real macro tailwinds, (iv) has a long growth runway, and (v) has a very simple / easy to understand business model. But I appreciate your perspective / analysis.",2024-09-22
Sounds like I should look at buying some puts and selling some calls.  Thanks,2024-09-21

What will be interesting is what kind of IRR Brookfield will achieve on the India cell system AMT sold,2024-09-21
"Historically, AMT's premium multiples were driven by stable cash flows and exceptional growth. However, it now resembles a traditional REIT, making historical valuation comparisons difficult.With its sensitivity to interest rates and emerging market risks, achieving a 6% growth rate relies on lower rates and FX trends.Potential issues like Latin American churn and payment changes in Nigeria pose challenges. Even if growth estimates are met, they're half of past rates, prompting institutional investors to exit. The lack of attention to these issues in optimistic articles is concerning",2024-09-21
