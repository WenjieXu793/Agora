"@AdamR79 Hamas and Hezbollah seem to want to continue the fight, so backing off will not result in those two terrorist organizations stopping with the attacks.",2024-10-02
@HardytheTrader I had to roll out calls on LMT a little further as I was in danger of shares I have owned for a decade and a half being called away.,2024-10-02
"''Yes, the way mankind is going, best to be overweight Cyber tech, and F-35s/Missiles.''Yep, there are some very bad people in positions of concentrated power who are funding endless wars and arming others nations / groups to fight. They are skilled in packaging and cloaking their fiendish intentions for war in beguiling language for mass consumption. Utterly slippery slope.",2024-10-02
"""Have held LMT, GD, NOC, RTX for years, nearly a decade."" @SuperPac You forgot to thank American tax payers this time. Yes, the way mankind is going, best to be overweight Cyber tech, and F-35s/Missiles.",2024-10-01
"@HardytheTrader Have held LMT, GD, NOC, RTX for years, nearly a decade. These are great long term stocks, assets for all seasons. Intrinsically, a carve out from the federal pie goes to them and then to the shareholders as dividends / buy-backs and stock price growth. Never selling.",2024-10-01

$RTX is the best of both worlds (defense/aerospace). Been long a few years!,2024-10-01
@T_PNW I know more about BA than you think. Please don't generalize based on this HAZMAT requirement. Outliers can't be used to justify giving insane hikes to 30000 workers. I have seen the assembly. Boeing is an integration shop and most subsystems are done by their Tier 1 subs. Now there are some highly skilled test engineers who are paid highly. Aside from them it is just a nut job.,2024-09-18
"@T_PNW well it was not my plan to submit a  700 page due diligence report. Cost of labor per plane is 15 percent of which 5 percent is union labor. Just so as you know in this low margin business if 5 percent becomes 7 percent that is a full 200 bps margin erosion. That's provided Boeing can make money. Manufacturing business is a game of managing tiny margins and cost elements which I think someone like you has no knowledge of. Manufacturing anything in Washington state is a fools job. When I say transition to Arkansas it meant a gradual disciplined transition. One element a time until everything is hollowed out. These unions, strikes and other methods to alter wages when market forces don't allow are akin to playing yesterday's game. It is you who needs the advice of some pro with investing not me.",2024-09-18
@Tiger231 I guess this answers my question about how clueless you are….completely.You believe other states are willing to offer better tax incentives?  You think there are zero expenses involved in moving such a large production to another state?  Have you bothered to realize how negligible the cost of labor is per airplane?Don’t quit your fast food job…your lack of due diligence in investing clearly isn’t going to help you.,2024-09-17
@T_PNW well then maybe all jobs and plant needs to shift to Arkansas. I am sure these nut job mechanics are available aplenty down south. As a shareholder do I care about Washington state. Not at all.,2024-09-17
@Tiger231 haha how clueless are you?  You make it sound like the cost of living around Seattle is the same as Arkansas.,2024-09-17
In a break from typical Boeing leadership….Ortberg should request $1.00 per year for salary/compensation until Boeing regains profitability & strike is settled. This would send a huge message to the entitled and embittered  IAM workforce. Buying a modest $4.1 million house in Seattle hardly demonstrates integrity or a commitment to fix this sad pup we call Boeing.,2024-09-16
@ContyC - they are losing $ because of overpaid management's incompetence and hubris. Clearly they need engineers at the top again.,2024-09-15
