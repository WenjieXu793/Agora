"@BAII Capital They are generating approximately twice as much EBITDA and 1.5x times the revenues of Draftkings only in their U.S business. Their market cap is 2x too. This essentially means you're getting everything besides the U.S ""for free"".",2024-10-08 10:48:28.072554
Flutter/Fanduel's valuation is lower because they also own a low growth but profitable brick and mortar casinos.,2024-10-08 10:48:28.072554
"@Colorado Oilman they reported a profit last quarter.""DraftKings swung to a profit in the second quarter as its revenue surged on a 50% increase in monthly unique payers. The sports-betting company on Thursday posted a profit of $63.8 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with a loss of $77.3 million, or 17 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.Aug 1, 2024""",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
@silentrumble Thank you. I am in the process of looking into it and plan to publish an article soon.,2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000

"@Medguy Thanks for the suggestions.Nothing is too small for us to look into, if they are really small we probably won't be writing about them due to potential issues.Nonetheless, we will look into it. Thanks again!Best of luck.",2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
"so more than 100m shares added in 5 years, I'm aware the pace of repurchases is getting better but still.. Only $1.2b in equity and not profitable on a TTM basis yet. There is definitely potential downside. You're literally paying almost $20b for +- $360m in free cash flow, not to mention the freakishly high SBC, also of the $1.2b equity around $1.4b of that is Goodwill... as we all know Goodwill can very quickly lead to impairments, think Teladoc or even Penn when they assumed Barstool would be value accretive meanwhile not every acquisition in this space is actually good. My overall point being is that at these prices there is definitely room for downside, but I did enjoy the article and no doubt these kinds of companies grow quickly.",2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
DKNG loses money every qtrProbably will never be profitableBut as a country of Bitcoin ponzi gamblersIts just got to go up right?,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
DKNG still loses money and will continue to do soBet I mean invest accordingly,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
CREX and BEE are probably too small microcaps for you to look at. Both seem very cheap with respect to market cap/sales ratios. Some impressive management additions to each.,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"@Effen I spoke to probably 10 sportsbook managers when I lived in Vegas (moved in 2023) and all agreed horseracing is the ONLY!! risk free wager for the house, it also is the most profitable bet as the house nets between 8-10% of every bet yet every casino treats horse players like a homeless person looking for a free beer and air conditioning.  I remember when there were totally separate bldgs. that had race only books with names like “Churchill Downs”  Santa Anita” but that was late 60s-early 70s when I was 13-16 yrs old",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000

"@Effen No wonder horse-racing is dying. Owners, trainers, racetracks, and breeders are carving up the pie expecting the aging customer base to support their greed.  They are unwilling to make any concessions - all claiming their needs are paramount.   In many casinos, the racing section of the sports book is more and more empty.",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
@trentbridge Parimutuel takeout is usually 17-22%Slots are typically 9-11% (My spouse plays video poker with less than 1% hold).Straight bets are actually a bargain because the bookies don't have to pay for the cost of the event you are betting on. It is inexcusable to charge more vigorish on parlays because the book doesn't have any additional expense.,2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
@Effen I agree parlays are a money machine for the house but you can't have a $3.4 billion market based on small punters using parlays.  You can lure in a few thousand suckers but their bankrolls are not going to sustain a sports book for long.  A 9.8% hold is not going to keep clients for long.  It is what killed horse-racing.  A 10% pari-mutuel track hold is going to empty most wallets by the ninth race of a daily card.  Or half an NFL/college football seasonYour spouse is playing slots with a 5% hold.,2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"""Eilers & Krejcik Gaming estimated that Missouri sports betting handle would be $3.4 billion and operators will see a hold rate of 9.8%. ""Hilarious.

"@AlieGee This bet is already available in the form of stock options that expire weekly. The vigorish on this bet is a tiny bid/ask spread. There is no way that the sports books could offer a competitive product.  Of course, some gamblers will bet on anything no matter the vig. It also might need SEC approval.",2024-09-18 00:00:00.000000
Big money to be made in this sector.  Wouldn't be surprised if they start taking bets on the stock market such as week closing numbers for the various exchanges and plenty more to bet on.,2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
$35 Billion in legal bets and estimated illegal bets of around $500 Billion. Legal betting is slowly catching up. :-),2024-09-14 00:00:00.000000
