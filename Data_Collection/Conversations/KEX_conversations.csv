"Great article David, thank you for shedding light on KEX.  I especially liked, ""CEO, David W. Grzebinski stated in the Q2 2024 earnings conference call that he expects the trend for strong pricing to continue especially for the inland market. He also stated that the coastal supply/demand dynamics remain very favorable. Kirby is experiencing strong demand combined with limited new barge construction. These conditions could lead to further pricing strength and margin increases in future quarters.""",2024-08-28
