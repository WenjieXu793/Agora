The time to buy it was at 12. It just broke out. We’re going higher before we go lower,2024-10-04
"I think major issue with this article on the PE valuation where one time expense or write down caused the high PE. If we look at P/S and P/cash flow, the stock is valued quite reasonably low.",2024-09-27
Excellent article. I would also be a buyer near the $16.8 level.,2024-09-23
"@emilezola I agree with you, and really wish the best for the company. But it's hard to justify the price rise right now. As I write, it seems to have lost the gains.",2024-09-19
Nice article. At least we can say that the Supreme's sale eliminated the risk of bankruptcy. And $11 was the bottom.,2024-09-19
Past is not important. Buy future not past.New high today.,2024-09-18
Vans Warped Tour coming back…should be very positive for the brand as they figure out new iteration of the iconic Warped Tour,2024-09-18
"@Florida_Dreaming Oh, that's bad. At least the company's working on debt reduction. At this time, it doesn't look like VFC can surprise on the upside. And even if it does, there's no guarantee that growth will be sustained. But as the consumer economy improves, inflation declines more, rates get cut, and its turnaround plan starts showing more concrete results, it might just get back on track. But that's a wait and watch situation.",2024-09-18
"@Jeff Swan Vans has been increasingly falling out of favour for a while now. Now, North Face has joined in too, even though its less likely to be a trend driven brand. I reckon it's general softening in consumer discretionary demand, which is showing up across sectors, along with growing competition that could be eating into its demand. That's an interesting remark about EssilorLuxottica, I haven't covered the stock so far, but it might be worth checking out especially after the acquisition. Thanks for that!",2024-09-18
My previous comment was bullish.  Just saw how Moody's downgraded unsecured senior debt today to junk.  That ain't bullish.  I'm on the fence down a little over $10 a share with massive long term cap gains I will need to pay in another investment I have.  Maybe I'll lock in some losses to offset that and see what happens in 31 days.  Stock has been on fire past quarter.  Could be time for me honestly.,2024-09-17
Vans may surprise a bit this quarter.  Rumor has it they had pretty good back to school and I know my local store ran out of Knu Skool shoes.  At some point these comps get real easy to beat and god forbid Vans ever comes back into style we may get an ANF type stock boost.  The new head of Vans from LULU should help.  Make or break time.  I'm not worried about North Face.  I travelled a month ago and all I saw were NF backpacks in the airports.,2024-09-17
