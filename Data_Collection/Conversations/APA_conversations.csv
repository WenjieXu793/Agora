"@Tyreswat  Thanks for reading and being the first to comment.  I think $24 will turn out to be a very good entry point.I'd really like to see the internal engineering analysis for Suriname.  I suspect, mostly based on the tone of the comments in the earnings calls, that they think there is more potential there than they have yet communicated to investors. If it should happen that oil is $100 a barrel when Suriname comes on line, the cash flow could be transformative.  (If that's the case, stock buybacks now will look very smart).It would make sense, I think, for TTE to buy them out of Suriname, or perhaps just acquire them.   No idea how APA would view that.APA has made a number of moves in the last few years that have the effect of making them a more appealing acquisition candidate.  That scenario would simplify Suriname, and give TTE a large enough position in the Permian to matter.  Egypt is important to APA, but maybe not TTE.  The North Sea is too small to matter to TTE and would be sold.",2024-10-08 11:52:08.342590
"@Cattro  Thanks for reading and the comment.It was intended as a conservative estimate, to support a valuation assessment.  I think there is a reasonable chance they will do better than that, but that's not critical to the investment thesis.I also think the right timeframe to assess oil and gas is multi-year, so 2023 is not so different.Overall, I expect aggregate production volume to change rather slowly, in line with their objective of ""moderate, sustainable production growth"".  The decline rates for the horizontal fracked wells in the Permian are substantial.  Suriname is 3+ years away.I expect commodity prices, especially oil,  to be much more volatile, but roughly flat on average for the next few years as supply and demand are remain roughly in balance.",2024-10-08 11:52:08.342590
"I topped my position also at 24$ and for now it looks good. It’s a longer term investment and you get 3,8% dividend to wait for Surinam. That could be a gamechanger for this company and probably TTE will try to buy them out. Greetings from Germany",2024-10-08 11:52:08.342590
"“Assuming 2023 as a benchmark for production volume, commodity prices, and cash flow, a back of the envelope estimate of annual results for the next few years is ~ $1 billion in free cash flow, $370 million in dividends, and $230 million in buybacks (~7 million shares, 1.8% of share count).”   Why assuming 2023 ? That was a different world",2024-10-08 11:52:08.342590
"@Halfdayfree My general position on debt is get it paid down before anything else is done. Dividends and buybacks sound attractive to some, but I rather see the ROE improve, so the stock price is pushed higher over time. In the specific case of APA, this makes even more sense. They have tended to do buybacks at the high and raise dividends like firming oil prices will continue indefinitely. As for Callon assets, I'm still waiting to learn what is under the hood.",2024-10-08 11:52:08.342590
"@11822371 I don't disagree, and I'm invested - about 3% of my energy equity exposure.  Just geopolitical risk + debt provides meaningful price downside risk. Management shouldn't count on being acquired- they should refinance the debt now.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@Joseph V Good point - I don't know enough to do the modeling, but what's the break even cost of US onshore production? I see quite a bit of demand risk in 2025. One shouldn't rule out $50 oil in 2025, though my base case for oil long term is $70. Btw, given their debt, they should do more oil price hedging.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@Halfdayfree APA has a $9b market cap. What would the market cap be w/o Suriname. Another way to look at is the FID that TTE presented called for a $10.5b capital expenditure. Can't argue that the APA debt is not material, but I do question the overall significance relative to the potential outcome of the Suriname initiative. APA will be sold for sure. The only question is when and the reason w/b the buyer wants Suriname. After that the debt incurred via the Callon transaction w/b irrelevant.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@Halfdayfree APA's future quarterly free cash flow should be higher than the 2Q free cash flow of $121 million, based on the 9/10 press release announcing the Permian asset sale: “The net impact of our acquisition of Callon Petroleum and the follow-on asset sales is that APA has increased its onshore U.S. production by approximately 66,000 boe/d in 2024 and continued to add economic unconventional inventory, with no material change in net debt levels compared to year-end 2023.Pro-forma fourth-quarter U.S. production guidance is 307,000 boe/d which is 34% above the company’s fourth-quarter 2023 production.""",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@Joseph V Thanks for flagging this. So that leave 650 mil to be paid down. APA's FCF and dividend payments for q2 are 121mil and 92 mil respectively, per gurufocus. That leaves 29mil for debt pay down per quarter, which takes 650/29/4=5.6Y, assuming other factors stay the same. A lot can go wrong during this period, say a lower oil price due to recessionary conditions globally (well the China hawks have been trumpeting this for ages), Trump election - drill baby drill, etc.  The best thing that APA can do is to refinance the Callen debt lower and/or keep asset sales to make this window of vulnerability shorter.  I'm of the view that the UST 10Y yield will edge higher and APA has a shrinking window of opportunity to refinance the expensive Callen debt. When they pull off this stunt, I would be more open to increase exposure. It is cheap, I agree, but it's cheap for a reason.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@Halfdayfree  APA is expected to use free cash flow and the $950 million of Permian acreage sale proceeds to pay down $1.5 billion of term-loan debt (with a floating rate coupon of SOFR +175, or 6.60%) incurred to fund the CPE acquisition.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@Halfdayfree Keeping exposure low is a smart move and Egypt is a risk now, but don't forget if there was a war including many other countries like Saudi Arabia, oil price would soar that may compensate for the loss in Egypt.",2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
"@esavela I bought NKE at $69 recently. I'm doing super well on it + my 2% dividend. I bought MO 5 years ago my total return is 66%. Value investing, buying on the dip whatever. Make a thesis, stick to it. I never bought LULU. Bon chance mon ami!",2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
@Abcd8 I don't doubt it - the question is how fast APA can de-lever vs. the timing of potential spillover of the middle east crisis into Egypt. APA has a window of vulnerability if it loses the Egypt barrels before it can de-lever. No one knows. Therefore I keep my exposure small.,2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
@Halfdayfree Callon acreage was supposed to generate huge FCF. It can pay its share of debt very well.,2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@Bulldog67 Egypt is only 20% of the adjusted production (after accounting for government barrels), but not all production has the same cost. If the Egyptian barrels are net most profitable, then losing it will have a disapportionate impact particularly when APA has a load of Callen debt. I don't know enough or feel interested enough to make a calculation - I'm interested in the name but only with a small exposure.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"Despite the false narrative of trump and the republicans, as I have been writing on Seeking Alpha for a few years now: we live in a ""New Age of Energy Abundance"" and the U.S. is energy independent (by an estimated ~3 million boe/d) and is the #1 petroleum producer on the planet and the #1 LNG exporter on the planet. This is one reason the XLE Energy ETF is one of the worst performing sector ETFs over the past decade (if not the worst ...) and if it wasn't for Putin & Netanyahu's wars, the results would have been even worst, and likely significantly so. Meantime, note the American ""big-3"" (Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips) aren't making any significant investments in wind, solar, and battery backup capacity. As a result, they are increasingly ill-prepared for the 21st Century of electrification and they are increasingly contributing to global warming, and we saw the results of that with the horrific recent hurricane that laid waste to so much of the Southeastern U.S. and took more than 100 lives.There is no way the planet will stop burning up as long as the ""Big-3"" (little 3?) refused to invest some of their cash-flow directly into renewables. Further, the supposed ""carbon sequestration"" is a total disaster, ineffective, and waste of time, money, and resources. What a world!",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"Suddenly everyone loves APA, as they should. The ""Shorts"" are just starting to panic. Once the exiting starts to cover these short positions, we will be 2 points up, at the very least.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@montrachet That would be almost the perfect match for APA and TTE. The only difference would be in the continent, where it wouldn't quite fit.Good investing.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@11822371 What TTE buys via APA partnership is the US government protection, especially with Venezuela in the area...APA is actually the perfect match for TTE, not too big and not too small.Smart move from TTE, ""cheap"" protection and who cares if TTE invest 100% or 80%, it's a very safe political decision by TTE, almost priceless.That's my ""crazy"" interpretation.Good investing.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
