"Stock has been doing very well lately. I am so far underwater I’m not even excited about it. I did add some shares under $16, but I’m done and hoping for the best.",2024-09-24

"@A Hettinger Not profitable, but cash flow positive, meaning they don’t appear to need short-term liquidity. The endgame is profitability, of course, but that’s where the opportunity may lie.I believe that investors should occasionally make contrarian bets when the brighter side isn’t so apparent. If Unity were profitable, it would likely be trading at much higher multiples.",2024-09-21
"@A Hettinger The recent rollback of the runtime fee combined with the new CEO and the anticipation for Unity 6 seem to compel most developers to either return back or not switch.Also, In my view, investors should give Unity some credit for acknowledging and addressing their mistakes.",2024-09-20
"@LongShortLong I believe that Unity has some advantages with the synergy of its Create and Grow solutions which could be a competitive advantage over companies like Applovin, although the competition is tough.The new CEO has shown some good signs in my opinion. He's been in the industry for a while and recent moves like the rollback of the runtime fee were taken positively by the developer community according to my research.",2024-09-20
"Since IPO, I don't believe U has *ever* had a profitable year. While, yes, they have had missteps, I question if, even given perfect execution going forward, they can get to the point they are *making* money. Ultimately, that's something a business needs to do; make more money then they spend.",2024-09-20
Excellent article. Clear and comprehensive coverage of the company’s potential and market risks. I maintain a small position and will mostly likely add to it over time. Thank you.,2024-09-20
"The game engine company Unity is officially launching the next major version of its engine and tools in just a few weeks. As part of its Unite developer conference, it revealed that Unity 6 will be available worldwide on October 16.www.neowin.net/...",2024-09-19
@Srirachasource The majority of their revenue comes from $100K+ ARR customers. But that's awesome you want to hack away with Godot.,2024-09-17
"Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter raised the firm's price target on Unity to $27 from $21 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm notes that in a blog post on Thursday, Unity announced it has canceled its controversial Runtime Fee, reverting to its existing seat-based subscription model. The initial Runtime Fee announcement was badly mishandled; Unity made the right decision in scrapping the pricing model, Wedbush says.",2024-09-17
@Bitit [A lot of those former Unity users went to Godot which is the free and open source up-and-comer in the game dev industry.]which is exactly why i think it makes zero sense for unity to offer a free version to the majority of their customers.  unity needs to provide value.  they need to offer something that people want to pay for.  free = no value,2024-09-16
@ROBOT BUTLER you said that already - but good thing is that you don't know. New suits are much better and so is the tech. The companies leaving Unity make games that look like NES - yeah - I love Slay the Spire but GoDot looks like crap and just look at the games - NADA. I appreciate the love for the basement devs needing free software but Unity isn't going to pay the bills by catering to the cheapo devs who just want to develop something cheap. What customers? exactly. They are moving to bigger things imo,2024-09-16
"@Bitit Agree. Unity was already gouging users way before they stepped over the line that final time. Open source will take over here, and rightfully so.",2024-09-15
Sentiment has changed for the better now. Stock is washed out. Risk/reward is now to the upside. Not many sellers below $17. If you have a higher risk tolerance and are a patient type of investor then you can eventually benefit from the turnaround. Margin of safety entry $15.61. Price target: $25.71.,2024-09-15
@AlphaPappa And women...see former CEO of Walgreens as one more example.,2024-09-15
"@Julian Lin And you can buy back the stock in 31 days if you change your mind, and harvest the tax benefit as well.",2024-09-15
"As an indie dev, I'm not going back to Unity, would rather just build bespoke tech on my own platform built on godot. But they are headed in the right direction, the fee was the last straw that made people leave but, there was growing frustration before that. So now they have cleaned up the fee mess, but the vibe still is that they have been ignoring dev needs for a long time. The long tail of the Riccolotelo cleanup will be getting back to servicing the core tech needs that the community has been asking for over the last 5 -10 years",2024-09-14
