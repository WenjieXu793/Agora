Core (large / stable) positions in my portfolio exampe vti vtv VGT vb schd spmo or in stock prg nvda kkr meta mfst Speculative (risk and volatility) examples for me are wgs rna nktx and crypto miners etc … and now smci (lol) Uuuu uec fall somewhere in bet spec From what I’ve been reading  ceg vst tln have room to run and held in solid etf like spmoI tagged you in the vistra article .. did you read the authors comment to my question?Look up spmo’s holdings overall …. It also includes pgr and KKR ;) Hope today is a good day w gct !,2024-10-08 11:46:49.505855
@sdm_376 Do you have $TLN and $CEG as core or speculative investment?Too late to invest now?,2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"My question of the weekend is Why have these stocks  gone up? Excellent answer.I am long VST and CEG. Just started a small position on GEV today. Based on your article, I see a buy, not a hold.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@luca_m nothing to VST but CEG announced a deal, TLN is waiting for approval, the capacity auctions occurred, all very positive for IPPs with or without nuclear. when the market gets excited about a sector the stocks run before the results come in.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@sdm_376 nothing goes straight up, but a few key events can keep the share prices up, one is when the TLN Amazon PPA gets regulatory go ahead, the other is the Dec power auctions for 2026, some analyst think it can double from the last one. And at any time more co location PPA announcement.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
@Ricardo Fernandez but...it was about half price one month ago and...nothing has happened since. why was this not written then?,2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
@Ricardo Fernandez Interesting. Ty for sharing Re:” i so what we are seeing now is a run on the shares with expectations of higher energy prices given the data centers' need for clean and continuous electricity”Any estimate of how long you think this run will last ? And/or metrics as to discern when the run is over (other than prices plateauing or decreasing)?,2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@sdm_376 Hi. For the most part, I use consensus estimates and company guidance. I then calculate a 2-year price target with a PEG of 1.5x, i.e., in line with the market. For some stocks, I build simple models. I have the advantage of detailed data from Bloomberg and Capital iQ, which makes it easier to get a good operating picture.In the case of the IPPs, the analysts rarely incorporate higher electricity prices until the company discloses it, so what we are seeing now is a run on the shares with expectations of higher energy prices given the data centers' need for clean and continuous electricity.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
@Ricardo Fernandez hi . What information do you use to make buy / sell decisions ? With a 10 year rapid growth projection it sounds like you think the nuclear arena of stocks are strong investments… not to taper off any time soon - right ?,2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@luca_m Hi, not joking, yes its rallied like CEG and TLN on higher electricity prices, and co location data centers PPAs. Its not undervalued anymore, its at fair value on current estimates, which may change on new PPAs or auctions. But valuation depends on your own investment view, criteria. I look at price relative to cash eps growth and factor in balance sheet strength and management execution etc..I dont make buy or sell decisions based on performance ie a price chart.Of the three I see TLN with the most upside since they have not hedged prices yet.The nuclear power supply chain stands to grow rapidly over next 10yrs, from CCJ to GEV and even the small reactor idea like OKLO.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@Ricardo Fernandez no wait so you are saying that after being up like 80% in a month, almost exclusively on hype (missed earning the last 3 times) this is undervalued? and you are an analyst. Please tell me you are joking",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@luca_m which is FOMO, the increasing price of VST ? TY",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@sdm_376 I call this FOMO, and these stories very rarely end well. we'll see",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
@The ROE Rocketeer @luca_m  and then up another 16 % since your post on 9/25. go figure.,2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"VST is my most ridiculous position.  Bought 100 shares at 17.  When it hit 35, I sold a Jan 50 Call.  At some point I rolled the 50 call to 2x 80 calls and sold puts as strangle.   Those 2 80 calls became 3 100 calls (2 Jan and 1 in June) with 9 Puts sold as strangles against them with strikes ranging from 65 to 110 spread over several months.  Delta is currently -55 and Theta is 49 so I’m just earning premium as I roll calls and sell puts.  Hope the stock pauses and pulls back a bit so my calls can expire, probably after another roll.  No margin pressure as I got a bunch of stuff expiring over the next two weeks.",2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
"@waterlogger The situation isn't nearly as bleak as you paint it. The major data centers will either build (or contract) for nearby power or locate near a transmission line with spare capacity. This will happen because it will take years or decades for the regulated utilities, regulated transmission authorities, independent system operators, public utility commissions, FERC, etc. to react to major load increases let alone build any infrastructure. The data centers will want to open NOW (or as close to that as possible) and won't want to wait for power to be delivered let alone an uncertain outcome in any decision making by numerous authorities.",2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
"The early data centers will approach existing regulatory authorities processes hoping for ratepayer assisted funding of additional power generation. That won't last long as more and more apply for power.The regional transmission authorities will squeal with glee at the ability to insist all members in their trans authority pay for additional transmission to wheel this new power across their regions and cross sell to others.There will be a ratepayer revolution and regional transmission authority membership defections as these costs reach a point where everyone is paying more to feed the data center who needs the power when they should be the cost payer.Politicians and their henchmen regulators will revisit more generation on a predictable election schedule.Outcomes may be less than desired by all parties.FERC may have to reorganize the regional transmission authority structure to prevent failure by any one of them causing widespread power problems Always a comforting feeling knowing the govt is taking it all under its control to keep the lights on right?Be sure to watch for the national grid they keep yippin' about. Imagine the cost for that priceless gem.It would be a strong consideration if data centers self generated and sold back excess power if and when they had any.Let the regulators stew on those details as equitable to all.The time and costs to acquire land, receive approvals, comply with permitting, and build a generation plant should not be on the backs of nameless faceless ratepayers or utilities especially those with no data center loads to defray costs.Some will get many data centers, some will get none, all will pay for them.That you can be sure of.The electric grid and local distribution system in most countries have their own costs to deliver power to the end user. They aren't the same price or cost until somebody forces them to pay for others use. Like adding renewables where there is no transmission lines to connect or a data center you'll never use but is served by your utility.To inflict costs on everyone to add power for data centers is just plain wrong.Let them source their ownneeds. They will charge for the data they handle. They can add the generation costs on their customers use.When one of these data centers fails, it will near bankrupt the serving utility.Regulators better consider that into their approvals too.",2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
@nattylover Capacity may not be a commodity but it definitely isn't a regulatory construct. It is an engineering and physical restraint.,2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
It goes without saying that my worst move this year was selling my small VST stake.,2024-09-29 00:00:00.000000
@lowdawg81 which pays for the capex as margins stay the same - some of these names are trading like they aren't going to have to invest a bunch back in,2024-09-29 00:00:00.000000
