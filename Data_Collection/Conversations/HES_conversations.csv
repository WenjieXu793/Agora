What is XOM right if CVX buys 15 % of hess stock and Hess stays alive,2024-10-08 10:52:38.778747
"@faulty eye I suspect the problem here is on the Hess side, not the XOM side.  Hess and CVX are the ones trying to avoid the right of first refusal.  They created this mess to start with.If you look at Hess results before the Guyana oil began flowing, they were nothing spectacular.  Even now, the US part is not making money in this environment.  That tells you all you need to know.",2024-10-08 10:52:38.778747
"The lawyers who wrote up the RFF,Should be fired. The whole idea ofArbitration is to expedite any conflict,By avoiding the courts.Yet XOM has cynically abused the process, by unnecessarily delayingResolution. If CVX prevails they should get damages awarded from XOM. The RFF should have addressed The possibility of HES selling all of itTo avoid this boondoggle.",2024-10-08 10:52:38.778747
IMHO the HES board looks worse and worse the longer this drags out. It is rather unclear to me how the outside shareholders are being protected from the insider self-dealing on the CVX share pricing. If the HES board did not consider the impact of time delay and more FPSO's coming online then the HES board did not perform their responsibilities properly.,2024-10-08 10:52:38.778747
@William Frey The right of first refusal often goes along with the original bidder has the right to raise the price.  John Hess has said he would rather stay independent than sell to XOM.  But that seems a rather strange stance.,2024-10-08 10:52:38.778747
"So the ""first right of refusal"" is not giving XOM the right to match the offer but rather allows XOM to purchase at fmv (determined as of what date?) or make a competing offer.  I don't think the terms of the FRR have been made public so I don't think anyone (except insiders) knows what the terms are.  But my understanding of a FRR is a right to acquire at the same deal terms, not the right to bid.  If so, and you are correct that HES is now much more valuable than it was (I think you are correct), then either CVX or XOM gets the good deal, HES shareholders get what CVX offered no matter what.  Best outcome for HES is that the deal fails completely.  I am willing to be corrected if I am wrong.",2024-10-08 10:52:38.778747
just holding tight to my shares and thinking that MAYBE I'll eventually get what my shares are worth if this fight drags out longer than expected.,2024-10-08 10:52:38.778747
Hess does not need to be a board member to have an influence on how the company is run.,2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
"I can't believe they would accept John Hess not being a board member. I'd certainly want him there.FTC:""As detailed in the complaint, the merger agreement between Chevron and Hess Corporation requires Chevron to take all actions necessary to appoint Mr. Hess to its Board of Directors. The FTC’s complaint alleges that, as a Chevron Board member, Mr. Hess would gain a much larger platform to amplify his supportive messaging to OPEC and others about OPEC’s market stability goals, increasing the likelihood that Chevron could align its production with OPEC’s output decisions to maintain higher oil prices. The complaint alleges that, given his prior conduct, Mr. Hess’s appointment to Chevron’s Board of Directors would heighten the risk of harm to competition, including meaningfully increasing the risk of industry coordination.The FTC’s proposed consent order would prohibit Chevron from nominating, designating, or appointing Mr. Hess to the Chevron Board, and from allowing Mr. Hess to serve in an advisory or consulting capacity to, or as a representative of, Chevron or the Chevron Board. The proposed consent order would allow Chevron to consult with Mr. Hess and allow him to serve as an advisor, consultant, or representative of Chevron, solely related to interactions and discussions with (a) Guyanese government officials about Hess’s oil-related and health ministry-related activities in Guyana, and (b) the Salk Institute’s Harnessing Plants Initiative.""",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@BrownSwiss   The merging of Chevron and Hess has no impact on the pump prices.  Hess has no domestic refineries.  Generally, oil is bought and sold in the open market rather than for the company refinery because of oil grade and location (production site versus refinery location).",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"@BrownSwiss “Two oil companies merging who actually impact price at the pump — Sure go ahead.”  Let’s see - Chevron produces (controls) a little less than 3% of the daily petroleum consumption; if the merger goes through as proposed, it will be slightly more than 3%. How much do you think that will move the needle at the pump?",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"@Peter Jaworowski I don't think XOM wanted nor want any more from Guyana. 45% is more than sufficient unless the purchase would have been a no brainer. Delaying and reducing their risk of lawsuits from current shareholders is what I think they are doing; to say they did everything they could.  + delaying will provide them more and new exploration data which better evaluate the value of the current Bid. Could they Bid over CVX, sure, if the data provides for a conclusive  value that exceeds the current Bid. If they can produce Brent quality Oil and NG at below $25 or less going forward they will fight for more. $25 is a stake in the ground, it could very well be between $25 - $40 based on what they think they can get for Brent and LNG over the next 10 - 30 years. This is a long term play !",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
@CyclePilot the point of my comment is government seems to think protecting consumers is more effective by maintaining a mid-tier luxury handbag market than by keeping competition in place between two large American oil and gas producers.,2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
@Mike Walker I've been thinking about this case and the latest acquisitions these companies proposed last October.  Exxon acquired Pioneer and Chevron is working on acquiring Hess.  I wonder if it would have worked out better for everyone if Exxon acquired Hess and Chevron acquired Pioneer?We obviously wouldn't be dealing with this arbitration now and each companies portfolio would have been stronger.,2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
@BrownSwiss dude.....read.  XOM and CVX are not merging.   This is the Hess/CVX DEAL,2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"@BrownSwiss   ,,,,""Two oil companies merging who actually impact price at the pump — Sure go ahead.""....Who said anything about CVX and XOM merging? This is a battle over a part of the Guyana assets. Although these 2 are the biggest American oil companies, they don't dictate world energy prices, and gas prices. It's just the opposite. World oil prices dictate the stock prices of XOM and CVX.",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
@BrownSwiss they are creating volatility so that traders do not think there is risk-free money.,2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"The window opens for a deal between CVX and XOM.  No reason to negotiate pre FTC approval, now that this hurdle has been jumped, a ‘win-win’ would make a lot of sense.I think XOM’s chances in the arbitration are low and they challenged purely as greenmail and as a delaying tactic.",2024-09-23 00:00:00.000000
"Two oil companies merging who actually impact price at the pump — Sure go ahead.Amazon trying to buy iRobot — consumer harm!Meta trying to buy a meme company — think about the people!!!Google search is too good — fine them and break them up and give the people what they really want, Bing!!So I ask, what are these bureaucrats doing?",2024-09-23 00:00:00.000000
The increase is not enough to keep  investors waiting.With all of the delays and the price of oil falling are not pluses for the deal.CVX may look at HES is over priced and walk away with billions in break up fees.,2024-09-20 00:00:00.000000
