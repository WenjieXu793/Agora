"@Non-GAAP Earnings What I said is factually correct.  Whether you think it is the best strategy is a separate discussion.Truth is that canned soup has been in decline as a product category since the 1990s.  It has huge margins because CPB has incredibly efficient supply chain (hint:  I was an insider to that supply chain), but volumes are declining...  very slowly, but very steadily.  They tried ""healthy"", ""sea salt"", fresh, etc soups, and none gained any traction.Every year the soup marketing team would walk into strategic planning meetings with their brilliant ideas on how to grow the category, and every year production would set out plans based on 1% volume decline.  And production was always right.So the Board, which was very slow to get off the ""Soup is King"" mark (a lot of the Board is still the Dorrance family) would keep backing the soup growth plans...  until finally even they realized that ship had sailed and the future was in snacks.",2024-09-13
"With the acquisition of Snyder's Lance about 5 years ago, CPB became more snacks than soup.  Remember that they also own Pepperidge Farm which is mostly Goldfish and cookies.Surprised it took this long to take ""soup"" out of the name.",2024-09-13
No dividend increases for years was the reason I sold. I can invest in bonds that are more secure. Also growth prospects do not look that good as the consumer is tapped out and is looking for cheaper prices that CPB cannot do without hurting their bottom line.,2024-09-13
"At roughly 15x earnings and sales growth under ideal conditions matching inflation, it's hard to justify the risk.  Investors are buying a familiar brand and simply waiting for a hiccup that slices 10-50% of share value. The risk/reward sounds a lot like buying a familiar and ""safe"" 30 year treasury at 1-2% yield.  Not much to gain. Plenty to lose.",2024-09-12
"Companies blunder all the time when management tries to be ""cool"" and forgets where the company's competitive advantages lie. Soup may be boring and it may be a post-mature market, but it has steady, easy cash flows until the end of time. Maybe someday they'll spin it off, the way WK Kellogg got spun.",2024-09-11
"@love fossil Poor people eat McDonald's, but lots of money is made by them. Whenever they try to go upscale, they get zapped. Which I suspect will happen here too, but I'd be happy to be wrong.",2024-09-11
CPB should change its name to reflect the products it sells. Sauce is boss! Soup is what poor people eat. “Soup Kitchen “ .,2024-09-10
"Who buys Rao's pasta sauce? It costs 2-3 times the cost of other sauce, and how different can it be, really?",2024-09-10
