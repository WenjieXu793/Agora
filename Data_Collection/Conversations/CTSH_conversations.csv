"@UndiversifyBC Agreed overall, although I am more optimistic as I think the Belcan acquisition presents a good opportunity for growth, given its operations in the A&D sector, which in my view would allow Cognizant to benefit by diversifying from the segments it operates in currently. Engineering, Research and Development is also not as easy to ""automate away"" by AI (at least in the foreseeable future), so I think the demand for outsourcing is safer and has greater potential in this industry. However, given how uncertain the future of AI is overall, I think it makes the most sense to be ""cautious"" with any company that is closely integrated with it.",2024-09-07
"Think I missed out on this one awhile back when it was going through some serious turmoil. Feel the IT services business is pretty solid though maybe not as optimistic on organic growth. Might be worth keeping an eye on CTSH becoming a serial acquirer. Seems pretty consistent last three years with buys, though not huge, that helped keep revenues fairly stable. Appears they ramped it up a bit in 2024 with early $400mm acquisition and now $1B Belcan. Not that these purchases are necessarily bad. Have a more conservative equity FV around $70ish. With a 10x ebitda ent. value, excluding any Belcan effect. ""Cautiously optimistic"" might be just the right description for CTSH.",2024-09-06
