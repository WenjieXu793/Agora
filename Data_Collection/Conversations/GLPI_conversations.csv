"@donpizza thanks for your insight! Only time will tell, I believe the deal will prove accretive for GLPI. Cheers!",2024-10-01
"As a Chicagoan, (and GLPI investor) I would say ""Not so fast"".  The temporary BALY casino put in downtown Chicago (the only one in town) has not come close to it's projected traffic or revenue.  In fact, in 2023 it reached only 26.6% of it's projected revenue!  GLPI is funding for the shaky BALY this build to suit project with plenty of risk.  Not to say it won't work out but there is no track record that says it wil be smooth sailing.",2024-10-01
Why recommend DLKwhose payout ratio is ~ 147% ?A payout ratio over 100% indicates that the company is paying out more in dividends than its earnings can support and this could be an unsustainable practice.,2024-09-30
"@jamesy1959 with around 80% forward looking AFFO payout ratio and increasing investment activities (they recently closed the previously announced deal), I have no concerns about their ability to uphold and grow dividends. 100% occupancy, outstanding lease terms, and reasonable coverage make a strong case for the dividend's safety. Cheers!",2024-09-24
GLPI has a dividend safety score of D+  is that any cause for concern?,2024-09-24
"@jamesy1959 that would be good. . As we all know, beating earnings estimates means a lot.Seemed like they never liked REITs a couple years ago, now they do.Always looked at how your company was going aged in its sector.  They do follow a lot of smaller companies, which I don’t care much about.",2024-09-20
@steve7074 Thank you for the reply. I've mainly been check out the EPS revision grade to see if quant thinks things are trending up or trending down.,2024-09-20
"@jamesy1959 generally that’s due to momentum & earnings adjustments.  Always good when your revenue or earnings get adjusted up.I find quants very useful. They have killed the Market over the years.  Nothing wrong with looking at stocks at the bottom, either.It’s just a tool, but a very useful one.  I don’t get folks who can’t find how useful it is.",2024-09-20
"@Value Digger If you’re going to include small oil companies with safe dividends and fortress balance sheets, why not add $PEYUF and $EGY? Both are great as well. G",2024-09-17
@jamesy1959 Thanks for all the comments guys. I tend to look at the components of the quant and wonder why they show sell when a stock has good scores in the other areas. I'm retired and not trying to invest in the next nivida but rather trying to put together a SWAN portfolio that will give me dividend income. I'm invested currently but always looking to tweak the holdings so I can sleep better at night.,2024-09-17
"@Pinguino Investments maybe that’s it in many articles, really glad to own DIVO.  Great for a retiree, have confidence in Kevin Simpson.   Selling some covered calls helps add to the yield, near 5%.   Total return beats JEPI.( JEPIX) by 2% over 5 years.",2024-09-17
"@steve7074 Oh, sorry, I didn't really pay attention to the ETFs they listed at the end.  I was focused on the ten high-yielding stocks.  As for the ETFs,  I see that they only included the five largest.",2024-09-17
"@Value Digger The list consists of companies with a market cap of at least $1 billion. EPSN's market cap is only $109 million. It may be all the good things you say it is, but it's too small for this list.",2024-09-17
"I believe that Epsilon Energy (EPSN) needs to be included into the list.EPSN offers a safe 5% dividend while maintaining a fortress balance sheet.Additionally, EPSN is grossly undervalued on absolute and relative valuation analysis, so significant capital gains are very likely in the next 12 months.On top of this, EPSN's insiders including the CEO have increased their stake over the last months.",2024-09-17
"@jamesy1959 Make your own decisions, but I find the Quant Ratings to be almost useless. First off, the ratings tend to be backwards looking. Even the momentum component focuses on what's already happened. Secondly, I have no idea who the quaint analysts are. If they are anything like many SA authors, you don't want to pay much attention to them. If they were any good, they'd be working for real investment banks.",2024-09-17
"I own No.9 and No.10. If you’re looking for yield, you can’t go wrong with either MAIN or KNTK. G",2024-09-17
"@Pinguino Investments SCHD & VYM don’t have yields of 5%, closer to 3%, DIVO is almost 5%.",2024-09-16
MAIN and OHI are proven survivors and worth an investment at the right price. IMHO,2024-09-16
@jamesy1959 I find quant a fantastic tool for understanding what the stock has done over the previous 2 quarters.,2024-09-16
