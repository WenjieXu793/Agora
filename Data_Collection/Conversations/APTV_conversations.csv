"@Firebelly My base case is always the historical average performance. I have a simple approach to forecasting. I judge whether the future will be the same, better or worse. If it is better or the same and I have a margin of safety based on the past, then it is an obvious choice. The challenge with DCF valuation is that the value will depend on your outlook. If you paint a fantastic picture, there will be a good margin of safety.",2024-09-11
"@Hong Chew Eu out of curiosity, do you never use future earnings forecasts in your predictions or just for this stock? If not, i feel like that’s a crucial component of stock investing. Analysts are usually relatively close, and APTV hasn’t been far off analysts estimates. But I'm not asking you to trust in the management for the future-looking earnings, but rather from analysts who are reporting this based somewhat on management but also their own analyses.  To what extent the analysts are incorrect is unknown to me, but it's clear that they do have growth on the horizon If you believe even anything from the analysts. And it’s trading amazingly cheap right now. I don’t think you can go very wrong on this play. I’m selling a put to reduce my cost basis as well.",2024-09-11
"@Firebelly Valuations are based on assumptions. You will have a high intrinsic value if you project a very positive picture. The challenge has always been about grounding the assumptions in reality. For this I rely on the past. All mgt tell you fantastic growth stories. But if the track record has not been good, would you rely on their growth stories? The industry may be growing but there are competitors who will make sure that it is not a walkover. To come back to your question. Are there evidence to show that mgt had learned the lessons and that the future = past?",2024-09-10
"This is a great summary of the past. I like the Monte Carlo simulation in particular (can tell you’re also an engineer!). But on first glance, are you taking into account forward looking metrics? I agree their past is a bit Me lackluster in growth, but analysts are forecasting heavy growth in the upcoming years with a relative high number of analysts reporting. Forward price to sales below 1 even and lowest all time Price/CF, P/E, and EV/sales in the last 10 years. They are in a better position than ever in terms of forward-looking metrics, and are trading at the lowest valuations of all time! so I am quite bullish on the stock. thoughts ?",2024-09-10
