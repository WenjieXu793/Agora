"@Cash Flow Venue Exactly correct, was short before, prior to the cyber incident due to valuation metrics and looks like time to get ready again, unless like you said something's lurking with this company we can't see  :o )",2024-09-15
"@KKing btw profitability was way below market standard set by higher-quality businesses even prior to the attack that happened a year ago. Still - I don't get your point. Seek cash flow, not stock price movements, as they are often irrational (which is the case for CLX right now).",2024-09-15

"@Cash Flow Venue ""I don't get your point ""Which is, precisely. why your ""analysis"" is laughable.1. The attack severely lowered revenue in 2023 and the stock price tanked.2. The stock price has rebounded in 2024 with the passing of the effects of the attack.",2024-09-15

"@Cash Flow Venue Sorry, you should have put that definition in the article, because it's not a ""sector"" as the article described it.  Consumer Staples is a sector.  You lost me at the first paragraph with your custom sector definition.Long $CLX",2024-09-15
"Useful article. But I have to ask - what does FMCG stand for? I think it can be assumed that Seeking Alpha readers don't have to be told what EBITDA and CAGR are, but once you get into less common acronyms they should probably be spelled out. I'm guessing I'm not the only reader who has never seen FMCG before - but I could be wrong.",2024-09-15
