@No Wars...Vote Trump You still don't understand supply and demand.Oil is not political.,2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
"@Quality Dividend Growth I have not a Strong opinion about whether the Tax credits will be repealed or not. BUT, we have seen this before….First with Biodiesel and Turning Corn into Ethanol. Second with Solar Panels.We have seen how those played out. Eliminated are Expired Tax benefits led to Abandoned investments in Biodiesel, Ethanol plants and Solar plants.This is just another time around for that experience.",2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
@martyr1777 then you know oil companies pump oil.  They don't call around checking to see what's going on.  When Trump was in office Trump peaked 40% over top of Obama in oil production while Kamala is only 5% above Trump.  It sounds like Kamala is standing in the way.   Every administration has record oil production it's not something special but the increase under Trump is the biggest in history while the smallest increase under Kamala.  That's very telling and a big reason why we have inflation.,2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
"@No Wars...Vote Trump It was just a typo - it was actually the ""Inflation Act"" - the reduction was your real income",2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
Oil is doing fine. Natural Gas needs more export facilities.,2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
"@No Wars...Vote Trump I do own oil stocks and that's why I KNOW they won't produce more without demand increasing.Because I read their comments about being disciplined with increasing production and not wanting to lower the price.Oil companies don't benefit from lower prices. That's why they have record profits NOW, not when Trump was in office.",2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
@Lemonsack Those numbers aren't broken down on purpose because when you do break them down you realize most of that money goes to things like retirement money (no one wants to retire in a Blue State) and military and other government facilities.,2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
@The Front Porch Investor I was lazy and just put carbon when I should have put carbon dioxide.,2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
"@martyr1777 no, supply and demand is capitalism.  You seem to think companies won't produce more oil if it's possible.  You probably don't own oil stocks is my guess.",2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180

@SlowHandLuke Trump now up 5 points on polymarket.  Thank God because Kamala is a disaster.  Just look at the middle East,2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
@SlowHandLuke The so called tech bros seem to drink the spittle warm…..,2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
@No Wars...Vote Trump Why would oil companies want to produce more and drop the price when they are making record profits?,2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
@123semi Fact is oil production is only up 5% under Harris/Biden yet under Trump it was up 40% from Obama.  Why such a small increase?  Doesn't Kamala know when you import 15 million people demand will go up much higher?,2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
Inflation reduction act.  Can someone explain why its called that?,2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
@123semi I don’t really know how much “support “ it enjoys or from where…it appears to be a major expense with little benefit.,2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
""" including incentives for costly low-carbon energy projects that the companies have poured money into.""Subsidies and handouts, in other words, of taxpayer money. I want some too.",2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
Carbon dioxide capture is one of the first things I would dump. Carbon dioxide is key to life for plants and indirectly food. Removing Carbon dioxide in large quantities will destroy food production and starve people. Those who have drank the Kool aid will suffer the loss.,2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
Wait…if I understand correctly the oil industry wants free stuff?,2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
@bill h illify you do realize that red states are benefiting more from the IRA than blue states. It actually has very broad support behind the scenes.,2024-10-08 10:00:43.492180
