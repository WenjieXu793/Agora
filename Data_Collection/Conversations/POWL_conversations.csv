This stock could have been bought in the 70s in January BUT now it’s like $250 with 13% short interest.. this market is absolutely off the rails.,2024-10-06
"@Rhoda711 Certainly agree, but with electrification, tech and infrastructure there are so many of these small and even smaller companies than POWL, TAYD, HMDPF, ESP, etc that are coming into their own after being stagnant. All with low volumes and all micro or mini stocks. But in my mind this is where the opportunities lie to be make serious money, albeit them all above average risk level.",2024-10-06
Highly rated little company at their all time high..It was a good buy earlier… but on a dip and watch closely Little companies can evaporate quickly in a downturn JMHO,2024-10-06
@Research Wise Thanks for that insightful observation.  I believe the occasional after hours trade at premiums to the 4 pm close may be due to short sellers closing out their positions. Or having positions closed by their brokers.Some after hours trades will be $5 - $10 over the close. Often in 200-300 share increments,2024-10-05
"@sme20 Very good question. As I stated before the market has it's own logic. So nothing is exactly set in stone. I do make an occasional exemption. Relatively new buys that drop by 10% I usually sell out to avoid catastrophic losses. I will be the first to admit I did miss out on some winners. Exceptions to my rule if market is a bear market or bad news on the stock sector but not specific to my stock I will make exceptions. I have been investing since I was in the army in ""Nam & sent home part of my pay to invest so I can get married with some money. On winners I usually have a number in my mind  but I at times went over or sold below the #. I try to invest using fundamentals, Accelerating growth in earnings & revenues to me are the golden rule. No debt & type of business also a plus This is how I  have been investing for 50* years. With humility, I grew up in the projects & joined the army when very young. No college. married young lots of bills. Two kids & no one gave us a dime It was stocks that made me. I own a house in the 'burbs, no debt. What I am really saying is if I can do it so can anyone else!",2024-10-03
@sme20 good question - but I go with a change in business rather than set percentage. Moves down from 190 to 150 on Powell did not bother me - I used it as buying opportunity. SMCI and GCT were for different reasons more trading stocks where sentiment teallt changed. I got out of SMCI at 600 on way up when it got too volatile. GCT became battleground after short reports and bailed out in high 30s when they still used Chinese auditors after redomiciling to US. With small caps I find you can buy on good news sell on bad news - bit simplistic  but never see a reason to sell something like Powell when it’s producing good earnings report each quarter,2024-10-03
@JR Research excellent timing of this article/bullish call.  $167 to $242 today.,2024-10-03
"@sme20 Sorry for the intrusion on your thread, but, You ask a good question, I am interested in the reply. With certain stocks, especially new ones without established performance or special circumstances, or growing sometimes metrics will not help you. Look at PLTR, and MPW, you might have to look at the events. POWL is a fast growing company, which fits the category I mention, you might not find your answer in a statistic. Add to that the volatility of the market in the past few years and it is difficult to set a range of when to sell or buy.. imo",2024-10-03
"@duke223 Question for both of you--when do you know they are losers? Down a certain percentage?  Might I remind you both that POWL went to $130 from $190.  Loser at $130 and sold?  In the case of RSI, if quant is a strong buy and Fidelity agrees, if RSI foes below 50 for me it is a chance to buy a good stock.  So, tell me, where do you get your buy and sell signals and when do you know to act on them?  Just letting winners run, even without a trimming price (I use RSI) has proven costly--SMCI for one., GCT for another.  Thanks!",2024-10-03
@beach_trader I have to agree. selling losers early best defensive play,2024-10-03
@Damon Judd thanks long STRL for a while. Will check out others,2024-10-03
Just read this.  up 52% since published.  is it over?,2024-10-02
"@Get Rich or Fail Miserably Thank you for your comment and for highlighting concerns about the high short float on POWL. It's important to consider the dynamics behind these numbers. I’d like to point out that the short float has decreased from 17% in Aug 1st week to around 13% currently and during this period, the stock price has surged nearly 40%, after a volatile session, which could indicate that some of the bearish sentiment is unwinding.The decrease in short float suggests that some short sellers may be closing their positions, possibly due to the increase in the stock price. This phenomenon, known as a short squeeze, occurs when short sellers are forced to buy back shares to cover their positions as the stock price rises, which can further accelerate the price increase. Overall, while it's wise to be aware of a high short float, the recent reduction in short interest and the strong price performance may signal improving sentiment and the potential for continued positive momentum as the multiple and fundamental remain good.",2024-10-02
@Amrita Roy Are you still holding out for the low 140s?  :),2024-09-26
"@sme20 can’t argue with 103 on profits - other than capital gains tax, but hopefully you can avoid that.",2024-09-25
"@beach_trader All why I owned it in the $140's and $150's--ridiculously low.  But you have to admit--or not--the facts are that it is volatile. Up $40 the day those earnings were announced.  Fantastic.  But like before, it didn't hold.  Had my chances to add back in the $130's and did--sold at $190.  Loving it.  I can't agree more that the fundamentals are tremendous, and this time I may have been priced out.  Onto the next POWL.  But maybe, just maybe it comes back to $160 after earnings yet again.  I'll be waiting with a lot of cash.  In the meantime I have been up from $130 to $188 one time and from an average of about $145 to $190 the second time.  I have booked $103 in profit per share.  You see, we both win.  Best of luck!!",2024-09-24
"@sme20 You seem like super nice guy, and $190 fine sale - nobody went broke taking profits. However, what you are taking about is patterns, technicals, charts, that mean absolutely nothing in the medium term. Stock trades at quite reasonable 12 x forward EBITDA, for a company with no debt. Analysts have slightly lower EPS for 25 than 24, with only marginal revenue growth. They don't have to beat last quarters incredible performance, they just have to beat expectations and raise guidance - that's how the market works. And expectations are quite low - with that backlog, and the structural demand for their services, we may not get the 40% growth of this year, but I bet it's around 20% growth. If so stock will be in 250-300 range. So valuation is not expensive and expectations are quite moderate - I would not even think of taking profits when a stock is in that category.",2024-09-24
"@duke223 Since I don't currently hold it, I hope for you I never do see $160.  We'll see if the pattern is broken.  By the way, last quarter they beat by an extreme amount.  Do you see that as the new norm?  I didn't, so was happy to sell at $190.  If it is below that amount, don't you think it will correct?  That's where I am at --love the stock, but wary the beat can be that big.  Fundamentals remain great, but it went to $130 when they were as well, so we shall see.  Anyway, best of luck!",2024-09-24
"@beach_trader I am also doing well on this beauty just buying & holding. Up 13 days in a row. When I sell a stock I almost never re-upp. I start at the beginning & keeping my sold stock off my boards. Check all my posts, never lied or said I bought in at the low, sold high  repeat. Never, as a combat vet I wanna hold on to integrity.",2024-09-24
"@sme20 I don't who you guys are. After last earnings report I said obviously going back to highs and here we are. All my trades that I ever comment about are reported beforehand, not once instance of jumping in afterwards. Whatever, up a ton on this stock.",2024-09-24
