I hope all $WELL investors should read the report from Hindenburg. hindenburgresearch.com/...,2024-09-03

"I bought this stock hand over fist in 2006 converting my 401k to an IRA. Dividends were around $0.64 per quarter, about the same as they are today. However, my cost basis was around $34 which works out to about 7.4% yield. I wouldn't sell this for any price now. But, the author is looking at this differently. If you bought it today, is it a good buy? Various analysts set a price target on the stock between $106 and $130. I see them coming out ot the depressed numbers brought on by Covid to expanding significantly going forward. They finally raised the dividend after being cut during Covid this past year and indicated further increases next year. Not a great buy, but a fair to good buy in my estimation. It's a stock to hold for a long time.",2024-09-02
"Given the current valuation, SELL may be a valid recommendation.  However, if I was already a shareholder I would be more likely to hold.  These guys seem to be pretty sharp, and their track record is good.  I do wonder how many seniors will be able to afford the premium prices at most of their various properties.",2024-09-02
"WELL has some of the finest nursing homes and senior living in the country, which explains why almost 90% of residents are private pay. My thoughts are WELL stock has a very good chance of a fifteen to twenty percent increase in price.",2024-09-02
