"@Diman1 Hi, like most utilities, there is a lot of capex spent on infrastructure investments.  A lot of this is debt funded, so you need to make adjustments and subtract this portion to get to a normalized free cash flow.  And the capital expenditures are usually involved in the state regulatory process, which increases rates and income going forward.  So short answer is for utilities FCF has to be adjusted.  Hope this helps.",2024-08-22
