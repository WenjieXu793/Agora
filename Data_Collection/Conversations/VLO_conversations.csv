"Allowing for inflation, you earned about 10%/year.About the same as the S&P 500 index.",2024-10-06
"Despite the false narrative of trump and the republicans, as I have been writing on Seeking Alpha for a few years now: we live in a ""New Age of Energy Abundance"" and the U.S. is energy independent (by an estimated ~3 million boe/d) and is the #1 petroleum producer on the planet and the #1 LNG exporter on the planet. This is one reason the XLE Energy ETF is one of the worst performing sector ETFs over the past decade (if not the worst ...) and if it wasn't for Putin & Netanyahu's wars, the results would have been even worst, and likely significantly so. Meantime, note the American ""big-3"" (Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips) aren't making any significant investments in wind, solar, and battery backup capacity. As a result, they are increasingly ill-prepared for the 21st Century of electrification and they are increasingly contributing to global warming, and we saw the results of that with the horrific recent hurricane that laid waste to so much of the Southeastern U.S. and took more than 100 lives.There is no way the planet will stop burning up as long as the ""Big-3"" (little 3?) refused to invest some of their cash-flow directly into renewables. Further, the supposed ""carbon sequestration"" is a total disaster, ineffective, and waste of time, money, and resources. What a world!",2024-10-02
@LenceFlatu you are right there. In my opinion the lack of options for refining around the globe will further support the US as a large oil refiner. And MPC could benefit from it in the long run - as long as it continues to inject capex to improve its assets.,2024-10-01
"Libya shutting down has been a disaster for the refining Industry 2024 but maybe that ends in 2025 hard to tell. There are no oil Refineries left in Russia so that should help the Industry but the biggest problems remains truly poor retail operations that are decrepit, aged, not well run and now forced to compete with the likes of Buccees and WaWa. Long $bj BJs Wholesale strong buy as they sell both fuel and tire changes. Propane is not marketed well at all in North America by US refiners either despite stunning amounts of exports that only drive US consumers away from this very valuable product. Don't even get me started on kerosene and even moar valuable energy product. Long $rklb RocketLab strong buy",2024-09-28
"@Akim Guerreiro no , am looking for refinery metrics.e.g., what is their record for maintenance over-runs?normalized 3,5,10 years margins per barrel  (excluding SG&A)?are they better operators per age and complexity score of refinery?etc....",2024-09-18
@translate I am note sure I understand. Could you please specify your question? Are you referring to the earnings estimates for the next years of Marathon?,2024-09-18
"@Akim Guerreiro how do the metrics look for 3,5,10 yrs?have you looked at some long-term refinery specific metrics, normalized for refinery age?",2024-09-17
"@1sinedo wow, that's the best kind of feedback one could read. Good job holding since over 30 years! I am sure you are more than happy with your investment.",2024-09-17
"Thanks for the update. I have been disappointed with MPC's dividend, and you enlightened me on their buy-backs.  Now, I feel smart for holding it since 1991.",2024-09-17
May I pose a key question here? This sector is interesting from a valuation standpoint - are we seeing at this point any significant insider buying??,2024-09-16
"Could you please add DINO, HF Sinclair Corporation, to your list in the future? Also DK, Delek US Holdings, Inc. Many thanks in advance.It appears you are looking at the refiners and these two should be in your universe.",2024-09-16
@Elarotsap I'm crossing my fingers for a dip to $100 or below to reenter.,2024-09-14
@Elarotsap we bought it at 35 also. Energy now makes up 26 % of our stock holdings. I had a professor of environmental chemistry in 1974 at UCSB who spent half the class on why alternative energies will never replace oil and gas. Soo true. Good work for you.,2024-09-13
"@Saries I've been running in and out of the burrow with excitement. This is a contrarian's delight.Disc; long/overweight XOM, APA, CVX, OXY, DVN, XLE, ENB, KMI, PSX, NFG, UNG, SU, (OGZPY, LUKOY)",2024-09-13
"I love it!!! Make it cheap for me, big boys!!!!!",2024-09-13
"Thanks to the shorters, I first bought XOM in 2021 @ 34.25, when oil was ""uninvestable.""  Since I'm still buying the dips, I hope they keep shorting!",2024-09-13
"@Abcd8 It has been going on for years, so I don't know.  I think it is manipulation of the stock that should be investigated.",2024-09-13
"@Saries Right, it is the most undervalued sector by far. Just take a look at this table:finviz.com/...",2024-09-13
@jakeelwood5 I would really like to know what those who short APA think. APA has huge FCF Margin compared to other S&P500 companies and also to other famous oil producers.Just check this FCF Margin from Seeking Alpha:seekingalpha.com/...Why would anyone short such a company?,2024-09-13
"@Saries Not to mention that the entire sector is so beaten  down by the people who think oil is obsolete that it's hard to imagine much of a drop.Seriously, most of these companies have fortress balance sheets, massive cash-flows, rising dividends, share buy-back programs, and are trading around 10x earnings...What on earth are they hoping for?",2024-09-13
