@Skagit I almost don’t care if they have a branch anymore. I know if I have a real issue I will have to drive across town to one with a real manager or someone with authority to fix problems. Only a few branches seem to have anyone in them anymore that can solve an actual problem. Most are just branches with some tellers and a floating manager that’s usually not there. Banking is not what it was for anyone anymore.,2024-09-14
