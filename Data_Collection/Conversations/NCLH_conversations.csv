"@J-Flo The lines make it a super deal, though less so with RCL currently due to the high per share price.  But NCLH and CCL essentially offer a mid-single digit yield by taking just a single annual cruise.  If you cruise more often, you can collect (typically) for each trip.",2024-10-02
"Norwegian Cruise seems to be underpriced compared to its peers, Royal Caribbean and $CCL.",2024-10-01
@lilsdad Interesting… I did not know this about owning shares and onboard credit!,2024-09-30
"""Expanding margins as a 'top priority' means the company is focusing on cost discipline."" While this sounds beneficial for the company's bottom line, it raises questions about the impact on customer experience, especially for a committed NCL cruiser like myself. Should they diminish service quality or excessively hike prices, they risk alienating their clientele. My investment in NCL is primarily to benefit from the shareholder credit on cruises. Owning a minimum of 100 shares of NCLH entitles you to a $100 onboard credit per cruise.",2024-09-29
"@dwtaylor1055 The challenge I see is the US wealth gap continues to grow at an alarming rate, along with the national debt, and the situation doesn't seem sustainable.Perhaps the biggest challenge is housing affordability.  The solution here is not a good economic outcome.",2024-09-19
"@Dukebailey futures are showing everything liked it lol I am getting 2007 vibes with this 50 BPS cut.  2007 to the same day they did a 50 BPS cut and he is what followed over the next 18 months.Sep 17, 2007 S&P 500 @ 1533(Rate cut of 50 BPS)Oct 7, 2007 S&P 500 @ 1574May 11, 2008 S&P 500 @ 1425Sep 14, 2008 S&P 500 @ 1279Mar 1, 2009 S&P 500 @ 6872025 is going to be a rocky year(I hope not).  Yes the market is stronger and more resilient than 2007, however, other indicators are following similar instances when a recession is near.",2024-09-19
"@Tyler Durden 42 True, and I am a bit surprised that it was 50 bps.",2024-09-18
"@Dukebailey I don't think the market had a half a point cut priced in.  Possible, yes.",2024-09-18
"@dwtaylor1055 You may be right, but makes no sense as said rate cut was communicated awhile ago at Jackson Hole.",2024-09-16
I assume CCL will get a nice bump on Wednesday with the first rate cut.,2024-09-16
"@Michael - D “Best as in, best experience. Said nothing about investing in them.“This is an investing site, not a cruise forum - the context is always (should be), investing.“Your fanfare of $RCL may be tempered after you realize it's only up about 3x in 25 years”Here again, you have the wrong context.  I never advocated for RCL as an investment - I merely pointed out that they were the best performer in the industry.  If that qualifies as publishing fanfare, so be it.Having said that, you are ignoring dividends.  The RCL share price is 548% higher, adjusted for dividends, than it was 25 years ago.Fun fact:RCL shareholder return since going public on April 28, 1993 = 2,856% return, or 11.2% CAGRSPY return during same timeframe = 2,274% return, or 10.4% CAGRApparently, RCL has been a superior market performer, in addition to a superior industry performer.  My fanfare appears to be justified.",2024-09-15
"@Dukebailey Best as in, best experience. Said nothing about investing in them.Cruise lines are horrendous investments over long periods of time. High capex and lots of debt make them trades, at best. Similar to airlines. Your fanfare of $RCL may be tempered after you realize it's only up about 3x in 25 years, with much heartache - booms and busts - in-between then and now. Right now it's at a cyclical peak, so the 3x over 25 years will be less in bad times.",2024-09-15
"@Michael - D The relative share price performance between RCL and NCLH since NCLH became a public company in 2013 says otherwise.  During that timeframe, NCLH share price is down 23%, adjusted for dividends, while RCL share price is up 523%.",2024-09-15
"RCL may have the newest ships -but all else being relatively equal, CCL has the greatest potential to boost s share price as they continue to pare down debt at an accelerated pace.",2024-09-15
"@Dukebailey ""The reason that Viking underperforms the majors is they do not have casinos.""They also don't have gyms, if you exclude their non-ocean liners. Which is strange for a non-gambling, more holistic focused customer base. Total dealbreaker for me and many others.""Having said that, RCL is the best cruise line by far - assets, quality, innovation and overall excellence.""No. $NCLH owned Oceania and Regent Seven Seas are by far the best. Windstar is good for South Pacific. It was also good for Alaska but they dropped that route this year because it got too busy with the monstrosity ships.",2024-09-15
Yeh the economy is soooo bad the cruise industry is doing fantastic?!?! US economy continues to lead the world.,2024-09-15
"@tensei Nice!  Cruise demand has been insatiable since 2020, and one could have made a career trading them.",2024-09-13
@Dukebailey Wow literally caught the low for NCLH on the August 7th comment - sold majority of my position here at ~20% gain but NCLH has been a great trading stock....,2024-09-13
