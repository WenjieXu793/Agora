"With US interest rates going down and the Euro likely gaining on the USD, the Bayer Animal Health side of the business will have currency translation tailwind in the next quarters. The Aqua disposal will be reflect in lower leverage ratio and the integration synergies should slowly drop down into EBITDA and cash flow (and de-leverage). It is correct that innovation, as usually is the case, will be pushed down a couple of quarters, but there is plenty of shareholders' value appreciation available even without innovation kicking in. The stock is trading at an EBITDA multiple (13.6x LTM) lower than Phibro. And phibro in the order i) is 1/4th of Elan, ii) has a 30% gross margin (Elan's LTM is 55%), and iii) has a similar leverage ratio. Zoetis is trading at 25x LTM EBITDA: Elan does not deserve that at this stage, but somewhere in between probably in he 20x EBITDA which would translate into c. $25/share. In the longer term, when headwinds are behind, ELAN will be taken private by a private equity fund: operational cash generation is strong and appealing for a leveraged buy-out. My 2 cents.",2024-09-19
"Zoetis is certainly a good comp. But what makes Elan interesting in the mid to long term is also its comparison with Phibro. A much smaller company, with lower gross margin, and a higher EBITDA multiple than Elan. The combination of improved performance (top line driven by innovation, %-margin driven by cost synergies) and deleverage should in 1-2 years push the share price where it should be which, in my opinion, is low to mid $20s.",2024-09-14
