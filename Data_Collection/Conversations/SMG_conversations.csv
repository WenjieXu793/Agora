"This company has been a tough one. I'm a big believer in, buy what you know, and I use their products regularly for gardening. My cost basis is 135 and it has been quite painful. I've held on collecting the dividend and seeing if the 1bil in FCF will come to fruition. I think that if it does, even my cost basis is cheap for this stock.",2024-10-06
"This is a wild one for me. Bought it over 6 years ago when I was dabbling in cannabis related stocks. Watched it skyrocket to over $200 and thought we were going to the moon! Then it crashed, and I just forgot about it. Now, with reinvested dividends, and the recent surge, I'm back above break even, so I was looking to get out. This article has me rethinking. It's not a big position, so for now I will let it run and reassess in a few months. Thanks for the article!",2024-09-26
