"@T.J. Detweiler I just checked your $ 0.4 low, which happened on Nov 1, 23. Vol. was 3.3 mn, which on NASDAQ means less than 1.5 mn shares effectively traded. If all of them were bought by end-customers (and not by MMs), all of the buyers could have deployed max $ 600 K. So nobody made any real money, even if he bought at the trough.Two days later, on Nov 3, sp closed at $ .69. And where are we now? At $ 0.62! But I will stop posting about QRTEA. I have better things to do.  Happy Posting!",2024-10-08 12:26:58.007708
"@hunter3 It is easy to use historical price points to support any argument on relative performance. We just can't go back and buy/sell based on that. We have only this question to ponder.....""now what?"".....and move forward. In less than a  year, QRTEA has been all over (I understand we are talking about sub $2 security that has a tendency to be highly volatile) but odds are high that we will see these sorts of exaggerated moves going forward as the stock will be susceptible to news flow. Any incremental operational improvement that makes free cashflow more durable.....the stock will get bid up. Odds of that happening are quite decent.www.google.com/...",2024-10-08 12:26:58.007708
"@hunter3 I have no intention to persuade you of anything. If you want to think, that there is anything comparable between MSFT and QRTEA, that is fine with me.",2024-10-08 12:26:58.007708
"@Sam323 I quote: ""QRTEA had a -98 % return in 10 years and you are seriously saying that anything comparable has ever happened to BRK, AMZN or MSFT? LoL !!""I point out that MSFT had an awful return for nearly 10 years from the .com highs to the 09 lows and is comparable. I was not a buyer of QRTEA 10 years ago and I am not a buyer of MSFT today.",2024-10-08 12:26:58.007708
"@hunter3 LoL! If you bought MSFT 10 years ago, you are up 800 %. If you bought QRTEA 10 years ago, you are down 98 %.",2024-10-08 12:26:58.007708
@Sam323 MSFT fell 75% from the highs of .com to the lows of 2009,2024-10-08 12:26:58.007708
"@T.J. Detweiler ""By that logic, Buffett, Bezos, and Bill Gates (among many, many, others) are all terrible businessmen""as I wrote QRTEA had a -98 % return in 10 years and you are seriously saying that anything comparable has ever happened to BRK, AMZN or MSFT? LoL !!""QVC was bought in 1995 with Malone at the helm""I wrote ""built"" not ""bought"". Please read first, then lecture me. The QVC system was built in the 80's and I had a good view, how it was done.c) Totally irrelevant because of a different tax status.d) When QRTEA traded at .4, which was very briefly and not in quantities suitable to an institution, two LINTA bonds traded at 18 and 28. Now they are at 33 and 50.  Obviously the returns on the bonds were very much better than on QRTEA, even if you don't include the coupons already paid. The CY on the two bonds mentioned were 23% and 29% and this was paid to the holders. Not like your theoretical yield on the QRTEAs which have NOT been paid to the shareholders contrary to the bond yields and the bond prices have performed better so far, too.",2024-10-08 12:26:58.007708
"@Sam323 I got nothing else to do, so I figured I'd respond. ""a) a great deal maker does not incinerate 50 % of EV""""e) And if you were a long term investor in QRTEA, say 10 years, you want to cry: -98 %. If you add the QRTEP dividends, maybe only - 60 % so far.""By that logic, Buffett, Bezos, and Bill Gates (among many, many, others) are all terrible businessmen, because each of them have had at least 50% declines in their stock prices over their tenures. Study Maffei's and Malone's history, they're best in class. Focusing on the stock price movement is a patsy's move. You seem to think that Maffei should have prevented a warehouse fire and a significant retail downturn that were both outside his control. All decisions in the midst of this environment have been very intelligent. ""b) .... NOT been built by THIS management team...""QVC was bought in 1995 with Malone at the helm. Maffei has been involved with QVC since 2005. I'm not sure where you're going with this.""c) ...Not clear to me, why dividends are so tax efficient....""Based on this comment alone, it's clear you're operating on incomplete information. If you're going to invest, you need to read everything you can get your hands on, and you haven't done that. Because they're redeemable in 2031, the preferred dividends are tax deductible as interest expense for Qurate. Preferred dividends don't normally get that treatment. Secondly, instead of distributing a $3 dividend which would have been fully taxable to shareholders, the preferred distribution gives the same value but defers the tax. Lastly, the dividends on the preferreds are qualified, giving them long-term-capital-gains tax rates. ""d).....Not sure why this (the bonds) is so much worse than the equity...""The common shareholders have benefited the most by management decisions in the last 1-2 years merely because bondholders have a cap on their returns, whereby common shareholders don't. When Qurate reduced debt by over $1 billion, the bonds get no additional value because they're contractual, but reducing debt by that much increases earnings to the common shareholders by $70 million. That's 18 cents a share. And to use your reasoning on the bonds, QRTEA shares bought at the lows of 40 cents (and we were buyers then), get a nearly 50% yield. That doesn't include all of the other operating improvements that have yielded common shareholders well over 100% on their money in the last few years. Shareholders have seen operating earnings more than double in the last year, and bondholders do not partake in that at all. They get their contractual payment and no more. I'm not saying the bondholders get a bad return. But logically speaking, the shareholders--as owners of the business--have fared better by management decisions. And just because the market hasn't noticed is irrelevant.",2024-10-08 12:26:58.007708
@User 18282742 And 31 days later possibly after tax losses booked and now buying back.,2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@Sixty2nds To clarify...IMO the recent QRTEP Bottom of $32.70 will hold.Cheers,60",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@nkvbradenton IMO Recession fears have weighed HEAVY on a crippled Qurate. At the 40 Cent all time low The Market said Doom was the future of QRTEA.  Will the recent 46 CENT low hold. QRTEA is enjoying a nice bounce. The recent roll of debt combined with the last 2 Qs reports indicate Doom is not happening...BUT...I am not willing to say the QRTEA Bottom is in. Friday's job report is another positive, reducing recession fears...I am willing to say The Bottom IS in for QRTEP. I will continue to hold my 2X QRTEP Position. I do not hold any QRTEA at this time. It is likely to take 2 or 3 more Q's for the QRTEA to make a run. Cheers,60",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@nkvbradenton It was due for a bounce after a technical flag pattern that had developed over the last 10 trading days.  Similar to the pattern last Nov. 3rd - 22nd.  Chances are this is the start of a longer run higher, like what we saw from Nov. to Feb. 2024.  We shall see.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
@flipper58 Tax losses for the big guys have been enormous. They had no choice but to book their fate.I am not sure about the jobs report has anything to do with today's bounce.,2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
@nkvbradenton Some funds have massive losses worth more than the price of the stock. I assumed that was at work. And maybe bigger ones done. hedgefollow.com/...,2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"@flipper58 Yeah, I was adding around $0. 60 also and got quite a few big swings because the amounts are so miniscule. Yesterday I failed because I did not adjust my bid and canceled. Funny you could put a bid like $0.5995 and that is scalping a small fraction of penny! I didn't want to chase either. It will gyrate and we might get some more fills in time.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"@nkvbradenton I don’t disagree and hold some QRTEP too. I think the issue for me is where I am focusing new money to put to work here. Got my cost on my core to $.61, offloading excess today. So I am done on the common now barring it drops below my cost AGAIN. :-///",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"@flipper58 I understand your reasoning clearly. While chu-mp change for Malone and Maffei, they do hold QRTEP and that is at least aligned interest with the small guys who have positions. Since it is a cumulative issue, the dividend payment has a decent chance continuing, barring a sudden collapse of business cashflow generation. The moment there is some recovery of cashflow from nadir (quite likely), the common will get a bid. Speculative for now, for sure.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"@nkvbradenton My barbell comes from each $100m in QVC debt accretes $.25 a share to QTREA intrinsic value which stands at -$.52/shr on my work.  So debt reduction at qvc, via downstreaming or added Fcf is the same powerful result It accretes $7.80/shr on QRTEP. But since I own qvc debt I want the equity leverage on the common, not another equity type position.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"@nkvbradenton Follow the money. The money is made and downstreamed to qvc, the subsidiary. So clearly the plan is get QVC’s balance sheet and business stabilized. The returns between lints bonds and Qvcc are not that significant enough for the added risk I felt. Linta needs qvc producing solid Fcf. QRTEP especially is out on a limb. I feel it happens, recovery, but I can adjust as it does ( add more Linta bonds and QRTEP). Mostly it’s a play on poor work from rating agencies and funds that rely on those and treat the debt as a commodity. Agencies have more to lose reputation wise missing upside than getting downside wrong.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"@flipper58 Thanks. This is what I meant when I said the debt calculation is not straight forward here. I have seen some intelligent comments here on these MB's before and my head was spinning trying to make proper sense of everything, especially how the exchanging into certain securities would work and best way to value that. The arrangements are there to incentivize the takers with a lower interest coupon and a kicker.....that is what I thought was happening.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
