Question for @The Gaming Dividend and the group.I see you've done a few articles on DOW. I hold a full position bought in 2020 for under $30. So I'm happy. But I wanted to double down on stocks that will benefit from the EV revolution not matter who wins the battle for the best car.Does DOW stand to benefit from the rise of EVs?,2024-09-20
"@SUE2 ""An American WORKER produces more than four times what a Chinese WORKER does?""usa products & services are far overpriced.compare McDonalds prices and wages in Shanghai, Hong Kong & San Francisco as the prices are comparable or cheaper in China.but business is 8x busier in Shanghai and the workers earn pittiance 4600rmb/m 2016 and under 13000HKD/m in HK 2020. where Berkeley earns 2023 entry level $18/h.food isn't better in Berkeley than HK. Who deserves less productivity. workers in HK and more so in Shanghai & Beijing are over 8x busier.November 2020, HK living was 85% of Jan 2021, San Mateo living that is PPP!",2024-09-19
@SUE2 not hate my nation.1997 Shanghai was 40years behind sister city San Francisco.2015 Shanghai had complete social transformation & 30 years ahead of SF BayArea.2024. No improvements actually worse social conditions in USA,2024-09-19
They are aggressively cutting capital spend the remainder of the year and into 2025. They have lost market credibility.,2024-09-18
"@solidvalue you are right, i underestimated.  it is gonna get so much worse.  the MIC is getting the rights to build 2400 f 35s at 190 million per, and they don't even work, slow junk with junk weapons that the russians would not even taken an application for, so primitive, short ranged, unreliable and laughably inaccurate and inept....but the con goes on.......what an absurdity, that and the titanic debt snowballing towards us.",2024-09-18
"@bluescorpion0 you have the mainstream media take on things Geopolitical and financial.  Let's agree to disagree.  buy gold and the producing miners today a tremendous buy, see Paul Franke's most recent and other SA articles, a national investing champ btw. U R welcome",2024-09-18
I bought during the pandemic and sold at even. I think DOW and other chemical companies are long term univestable due to potential legal liabilities to forever chemicals. Not worth the risk.,2024-09-17
"@bluescorpion0 no.  having 7 trillion in outlays and 4.6 trillion in revenues and printing the difference or borrowing the difference annually is crazy.  With the debt now going ballistically out of control, that is crazy. The party forever crowd and borrow forever government have pushed the country over the cliff.  And there is nothing the citizens can do about it.   40 million illegals is crazy.  A new military spending bill is factoring in 2 trillion on a new F35 production plan of roughly 190 million per F 35 yet produced, for jets that have been proven not to even work, with technologies 20+ years old (outdated), is crazy.  70 percent of the F35's already made to date, for a borrowed outlay of well in excess of 1 trillion dollars, where 7 of 10 cannot be flown due to so many defects, is crazy......the country is over.  The nutjob americans bombing the russian mainland, is crazy, where Russia has nuclear delivery systems that are 15 to 35 years more advanced than america's, that is crazy.  Their weapons seem like magic to the american military and the weapons corporations.  We only have theories of how they work, because if we knew how they worked, we would have them ourselves.   That is crazy",2024-09-17

"@Cassiopeia Value Investing I always was a Ritz crackers guy myself. Like many others, I bought it because it had a nice balance sheet and looked to bounce back. But it is a weak stock in a strong market, so i might cut bait here and harvest some losses to offset and rebase gains.",2024-09-16
"@value investor 007 According to their statement it was an ""unplanned event at one of their ethylene crackers"" (no more details provided) and higher input costs in Europe.",2024-09-15
"""This combination will help the chemical industry to grow, but it remains uncertain if Dow can excessively take advantage of this situation as it struggles with internal issues, high competition and margin pressure.""What kind of internal issues do they have?",2024-09-15
@JamesRR Same here.. could probably take a tax loss on it  if they cut the dividend.,2024-09-13
Thanks for your thoughts.. I am even in this one over the last 3 years.. keep hoping for a turn around. The balance sheet looks alot better but they need to cover that dividend or its going lower my guess!,2024-09-13
A very well written and researched article.  I purchased eight stocks durning the pandemic.  Some have doubled and even tripled.  Dow has been the worst performing of the group.  Sold half my shares.,2024-09-13
"@tool man The REALITY is interesting and known by few. My view when people do not know the reason is that BIG BROTHER does not want us to know. Our two largest creditor nations are Japan and China. I list Japan first because they actually hold slightly more than China. More SHOCKING.Together Japan and China hold roughly 20% of our National Debt. Social Security holds 40%. HUH?  Imagine buying your own debt with obligations.IF, a company was doing this we would SCREAM to our government to shut them down.",2024-09-13
Negative news on DOW but thanks for the heads up on this laggard that I own.,2024-09-13
