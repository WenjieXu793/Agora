"@bottomupanalysis with a close above 180, we could get together and celebrate how smart we were in seeing the enormous investment potential in CVNA (while bears fought the rise every step of the way -- well done on that, haha!).",2024-10-05
@effiiciency your Russian mail order bride will leave you soon and take all the I'll gotten cvna loot,2024-10-03

"@effiiciency heading towards the next resistance level is my bet. As expected, analysts should begin to raise their price targets. Citi just raised theirs to 195.",2024-10-03
"The crickets aren't chirping?????????????  WTF. Could it be because CVNA................the STOCK....................established a new 52 week high of $179.93?Ax halted just under $180.  Hmmm. For future reference, the all time high in CVNA..............the STOCK......... was $376.80 on 8/10/21.  Presently there is only 5 points or so of overhead supply (175 to the aforementioned $179.93)Capitulation occurred 12/28/22 $ 3.62. with 12  million shares exchanging hands. Capitulation of weak hands means accumulation en masse by strong hands.  Either the ax in his duty to maintain a fair and orderly market OR Garcia. Andy has been routinely selling his accumulated shares at a MASSIVE profit and you construe it as panic?  Uh huh. $180 is now the focal point in the non-existent future.I'll keep YOU ""posted"" if that occurs.",2024-10-03
"Regardless of tonight's close, CVNA.................the STOCK.........................now has a new published 52 week high of $179.93.  Actually 104 weeks. Ax stopped it just ""short"" of $180.  HmmmmThat's now the focal point in the non-existent future. Any bets, kiddies?",2024-10-03
"Not just ""sell""  STRONG sellFunny how this NO position BS is written........... then forgotten.  Maybe induces some of the more impressionable. This literary ANALysis was posted June 24th at a prevailing price of $119.50.As I write, I can book at $176.95Translation, $57 point PER share opportunity cost.  Alternatively you missed 48%.  Thus far. Can YOU read mind OR would you like me to expand? BASHING one of my stocks, with NO positon, nor intent. sets my off like an Iranian rocket.",2024-10-01
"NEW quarter. Surpisingly CVNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,THE STOCK........................is up 2%.whereas the S&P.  down1%.  Guess that's 3% alpha. But that's only one session within a price TREND.  That trend measures 293% over 200 days.  Oh no, down from 400%. Momentum is slowing.  So, either the trend is ending OR there's room to move.Which is it, you saavy funnymental ANALysts? ?????Can't speak for anyone else, particularly in a chat room, but not going anywhere. Worth continued risk.  Yes it is. Keep YOUR eyes open for some news fluff, and I'll keep my eyes on the price.",2024-10-01
"New quarter and a new broom sweeps cleanSurprisingly, up 2% in a down market.  Call that relative strength.  But, it's only one session within a price trend. That trend, point A to point B, over the last 200 days presently 293%. Momentum, the pace, has come down from 400%. Either the trend's done OR there's room to move.  It's worth the risk to continue holding. Exchanging a PROVEN position for fresh risk is not2smuckingfart.It's also a taxable event.  Foreign concept, kiddies?",2024-10-01
"@RoyGraham Oooooh, you're a pro!!!Any relation to Ben?  Or crackers?More interested in being ""right"" rather than making money soothes that eggshell fragile ego. A broken clock is right twice per day.  Lookin' forward to ""it"", aren't cha?We'll call today ""relative strength"" but $175 will remain a magnet.  For awhile.",2024-10-01
"@RoyGraham an insider blowing the whistle, an SEC inquiry, an activist short report, etc. It will happen but when is a big question. I think sooner rather than later. It is a scam. Fraud proof? maybe maybe not.",2024-09-30
@Hawkeye Forever KMX improved GPU with basically same logic in short term - better margins on loan sales and improved throughput on refurbishing. Not sure how sustainable the first is.,2024-09-30
"@RoyGraham Those hoping for some sudden collapse in the stock price have to ask themselves ""Why?"". They will not have some big shortfall in performance as EGII will see to that.  So, performance will continue to ""turn around"" and the story will continue to hold together as long as EGII is willing.  Analysis will continue to write positive things as this is ""the AMAZON of used cars"". Outsiders should beware both ways.",2024-09-30
"@RoyGraham This company is full of lawyers plus all C Suit employees are multimillionaires.  No doubt they are smart.  So those claiming fraud are off base in my opinion.  Sure, they are among the shadiest in promotion, use of non-GAP metrics, misleading claims (""most profitable used car company""), ""vending machines"", and on and on.  But actual fraud -not in my opinion.",2024-09-30
"@bondsmoker IMHO there is no rational bases for making a long bet on CVNA other than momentum.  What is good for EGII is not necessarily good for outside shareholders. He will probably continue to sell shares, prop up CVNA performance and see what happens.  If he can keep the ""story"" going he will.   He will continue to sell shares until they get low enough that he thinks they are worth holding. If the company revalues at something reasonable (much lower) then outside shareholders will take a big hit, he will still control the company and if he sees it as a going business, he might take it private to combine with DriveTime.  Above all I think he will AVOID outright fraud as his billions aren't as much fun if he's in jail.",2024-09-30
"@Geoff Oliver if I had to guess, they don’t make as much on loan sales , they beat last qtr on unit sales, they brag that ebitda is higher and unit sales are higher but bottom line is flat or lower vs q2 2024 and q4 will be a lossThe stock probably charges to 200 on the “good news”The numbers will look good vs q3 2023 so they will emphasize that rather than results stalling out",2024-09-30
"@chi_tino Yes as you suggest it is easy for EGII to support CVNA without cash payment!    EGII companies perform numerous services for CVNA all of those involve transfer prices which EGII controls.  Low transfer prices show at CVNA as improved operational performance (no cash transfer needed).  Without seeing EGII company books we have no idea how much support he is supplying.  He has well over $4 billion of profits from his CVNA share sales so it makes total sense for him to help CVNA with large CVNA cost savings.  Despite what this author says CVNA capX is approximately 200 million shares times $175 or $35billion!  EGII owns around 50%.  If he can keep this author, Kramer, and his kin supporting the stock price then he has plenty of resource to pay off CVNA debt bank billions and still control the company. Given time they may even be able to make the company actually profitable. This company is insanely overvalued at its current EV but is in no danger of its ""recovery"" ending.  I would not go short in any form (sell calls, buy puts or short the stock). EGII controls the narrative around this company through his ability to make performance anything it needs to be.",2024-09-30
@energyguy921 haha good point. I think Adj EBITDA and GPU are all that matter right now. I could see them showing continued improvements there and even discuss paying off debts which minimizes the “going concern” problem they had 2 years back. I think much like bondsmoker I’m reeling from the rocket ship that has attacked my portfolio .,2024-09-30
