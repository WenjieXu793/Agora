Gross margins at about 10% but still profitable. The company must have very strong management. I like the valuation but the tight margins are kind of scary.,2024-10-06

I own CLS and have enjoyed their stock run up.,2024-10-02

No mention of their factory expansion in SE Asia? I believe that comes on-line before year end.,2024-09-28
"Thank you for this brilliant article!!The company repurchased 200,000 shares. This brings the total shares repurchased year-to-date to 700,000, costing $27 million. It plans to continue repurchasing shares opportunistically throughout the rest of 2024.The company's success can be attributed to its comprehensive supply chain and manufacturing services, provided to clients like Meta and Amazon.I am LONG CLS since $27!! Go CLS go!!!",2024-09-27

"@jjsbsw In terms of price, its been on a down trend since hitting its peak at 63$ (USD) mid July. There is strong support a 40-43$ technically since it bounced from that level 3 times since April. I would say anything in that range is a good buy. On my side, it has grown to be the largest stock in my portfolio and is over my target allocation so I am not adding to it.It does trade at a premium P/E vs historically (14.4 non-GAAP P/E TTM, 5 years average was 9.9) but revenues and earnings are now growing at 1.5 to 2 times the 5 years average. I really like to use the PEG ratio to evaluate stocks. Using the forward non-GAAP values comparing today vs the 5 years average, current PEG ratio is  = 12.59/28.59 =0.44 , versus 5 year average 9.35/16.9=0.55. So considering the growth it is actually slightly cheaper than historically.I think it is cheap because it is a Canadian company. It is well known up here that there is a ""Canadian stock discount"" that exists. Canadian stocks are usually underfollowed and are most of the time cheaper than companies with similar fundamentals in the US.",2024-09-14
"@STrepanier Greetings.  I have been following CLS for about 8 months as candidate. Appreciate your comments.  Not seeing great slow down, or current news that would cause me to question the current Quant and related ratings.  What price level would you suggest, based on your view of valuation and earnings, taking a small position? ( If no suggestion, understand.)   My research suggests $40 to $43 a decent entry point.Thank you.",2024-09-13
"Interestingly, the decline in CCS into 2021 was largely driven by its disengagement from CSCO, its then largest customer. And execution and profitability didn't skip a beat despite analysts and investors worried it wouldn't go well. EPS bottomed in FY19 at .54, improved to 0.98 in FY20 (despite pandemic disruptions and CSCO disengagement) and to 1.30 in FY21 which was better than their FY17 and FY18 EPS. Seeing how you take such a strong position on the pending decline in data center spending, when exactly are you anticipating the turn?CLS forward p/E is not 20X as your chart shows, with a current year estimate of 3.64 (3 months away), even at its peak of $63 that would have been 17X and now at just under 46 that's just under 13X. And of course when people look at forward earnings, they usually look about 1 year out and next year estimates are for growth of 11% (probably low), its 1-year forward P/E is even lower. ORCL suggests data centres will grow by orders of magnitude over the next few years. They're not the only one either.",2024-09-13
@Philip3 few of us are qualified to understand all the tangents of AI's impact on company performances.  I decided I need a fishing line in multiple ponds and to be patient.  I started early with a buy of AI (C-3 AI) and was lucky enough to exit that trade while holding my NVDA which I thought was a gaming chip at the time.  Appreciate the insight on CLS...I'll be holding and will read more before adding.,2024-09-12
"@tincupinhand Today, Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars worth of general-purpose datacenters are going to get modernized into accelerated computing. ""That's going to happen no matter what,"" Huang noted while discussing the data center market. CLS ""should  get a piece of that.  All that to say, the next evolution in IT is not over yet",2024-09-12
"@Blueblack Hum sometimes patience is needed. I first bought Celestica in May 2023 and it was also a Strong Buy on Seeking Alpha quants. Celestica is still cheap (although less than 1 year ago), is still growing earnings double digits (I see 29% forecasted diluted EPS growth on SA). With a FWD P/E of 12 thats very cheap for that kind of growthIt is indeed very volatile but you need to let it ride as long as the growth is there",2024-09-11
"Every CLS chart in this presentation is on an upward trajectory - - so he says ""stay away.""  I would at least wait for a topping out or stagnation before saying that.  Their webpage lists 8 business lines. They have their fingers in everything from defence, health, and communications etc. I would argue that with a PE of 12, there is room for price increase.",2024-09-11
@ks_ks_ks oversold. I have a very large stake in this and as much as I hate increasing my concentration I am ever so slightly. But I have quite a bit of a margin of safety on this one.,2024-09-11
"@ks_ks_ks don't take every analysis for Gospel. Read about the company, do your homework and form your own opinion. I am longing this stock and the above article, although makes good points, is not convincing.To address inventory turnover, management reported DIO at 81 in Q2-24, down from 130 days in Q1-23, cash conversion cycle down from 75 to 64. Cash is circling faster.FWD PE is currently at 12x, I don't understand why the graph shows 21x, what is it adjusted for exactly?Celestica is outperforming its peers in terms of growth and profitability. Its closest competitors are recording negative sales, and CLS is the most profitable with the highest margins and still growing, which means taking market share from its competitors. Yet, valuation is not reflecting this competitive edge and how well Celestica is positioned. Investors are more cautious then necessary about this stock, all because of doubts around AI. Deloitte tech sector analysis 2024 mentions that next year is expected to be transitional for generative AI, with tech companies experimenting and finding applications that can drive efficiency and productivity. AI's returns will come over time. Be patient and stick to the facts.",2024-09-10
No mention of their capacity increase in SE Asia via a new factory coming on board in a few months? Yeah â€¦.. they are REALLY slowing down soon. SMH,2024-09-10
I am looking to create some dry powder before the debate tonight...may trim CLS for lack of immediate catalyst ???,2024-09-10
