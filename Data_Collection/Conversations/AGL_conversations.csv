"Thank you for this article.  I want to believe in this company, but they don't make it easy.  Last year was a disaster in so far as cutting guidance, some of which was fully excusable, given that broad utilization increase for MA plans that surprised everybody.  But the last cut occurred just weeks after a conference presentation, where it was hard to imagine they had no idea.  A lot of analysts at that point, understandably, threw in the towel.  This year is off to a much better start, and IF they finally have set expectations low enough, maybe there will be light at the end of the tunnel by year-end.  What keeps me interested is the CMS position that by 2030 100% of  medicare patients will have some portion of their HC via a risk model..i.e., value based care is coming.  On their 2Q call, during the Q&A, they stated, ""Longer term, post 2026, there is really strong bipartisan support for a full risk vehicle for the Medicare fee-for-service population. That could happen a number of different ways. There could be another innovation center program. There could be a version of MSSP that has a full risk track or other. But there is, on the hill, bipartisan support within OMB and others. People really see the power within the model.""  If these trends materialize, and Medicare/Medicaid force the shift from fee for service to a risk-based payment structure, AGL could find themselves in a good spot with their unique physician partnership model and strong market position.  IMO, it's too early to make a large bet, but a placeholder position is warranted.",2024-08-22
