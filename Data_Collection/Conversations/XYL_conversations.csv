"@erbrown Don’t bet the farm on that. I don’t see cap gain tax on unrealized gains. For openers, evaluations are impossible, not only for the likes of farm land but also for 1000 shares of a publicly-traded stock, liquidity is a big deal.

Stock Market at record levels under Biden-Harris …why will change  to Trump be better for market?,2024-09-29
@slodon28 of course it will - just ask Milton Friedman. Spending leads to inflation (Why I sold any bond holding/ blended fund before 2022). Don't make this so hard.,2024-09-16
@TJ Burke Wont all of that NEW that government spending increase inflation?,2024-09-16

"@Brucejfern Having owned $MAIN, $ARCC, $OBDC, etc., in the past, I now think $PBDC or $BIZD (the ETFs with nice dividends) is the best way to participate in this sector. Spread the risk. Pay a little extra in fees. Sleep well at night. Remember to hold this in a tax deferred account since these dividends ARE NOT qualified.",2024-09-10
@Simon Chatham  Fact checking will show you are correct in the record amount of oil being pumped. Just shows what distraction can do to people's perception. Edit: forgot link.www.eia.gov/...,2024-09-10
@cyclingscholar  Procter & Gamble. $PG with a 2.29% yield. But near 52 week high. Does that information help? :),2024-09-10
