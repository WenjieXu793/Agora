@Umbrella I can't put my hands on the prospectus but the next call date is 7/1/2029. First pay date at the new rate is 10/1.,2024-09-11
@Umbrella It's not callable for five years. See the comment on Jeremy's article by Landlord Investor with a response from Synovus IR.  seekingalpha.com/...,2024-09-11
"The Schwab website indicates that the next call date for the E shares is Oct. 10, 2024.  From my reading of the original prospectus, this appears to be incorrect, and that the OP's 5 year call date is what is specified.Any comments on this discrepancy?",2024-09-11
