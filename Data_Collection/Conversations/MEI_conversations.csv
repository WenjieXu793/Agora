"The sales for the 2025 fiscal year are expected to be in line with 2024, but with the operating figures improving. The latest quarterly results showed a continuous decrease in leverage, but the net debt increased due to lower cash and cash equivalents. The sales continued to struggle with the decreasing EV segment and cooling down in the Chinese market, but the operating numbers improved compared to the previous quarter leaving some belief that the company's guidance (to reach breakeven) will be achieved despite the fact that it is still far from the usual company's numbers. With all said and expecting the interest rates to decrease, I recalculated my valuation expectations, reiterating a “Hold” rating, but decreasing the price target to $9.65 with a more detailed review next quarter.",2024-09-09
