$NEWT seems to lose half of its value since its transformation from a business development company to a bank holding company.  Don't know what 's going on with this small company...,2024-10-04
"Can someone help with this ? Once ALP loans are securitized (notes) and sold, does the loan risk transfer to the note holders or Newtek still holds the risk ?",2024-10-01
"@Hudson Investments Doesn’t bother me either but when 2 employees sell 8 million shares, it creates an imbalance and naturally depresses the prices, at least temporarily. I’m happy to be holding NVDA.",2024-09-30
@Investor since ‘73 The planned sale of stock by a CEO doesn’t bother me.,2024-09-29
"It seems that the 2 million NVDA shares sold by Coxe and the 6 million shares sold by Jensen Huang have put huge pressure on the price of those shares. In light of those sales, I am impressed that the price has held up as well as it has. Hoping that this cycle will now end and allow the stock to resume it’s track higher.",2024-09-29
"Weak insider trading lately because all the great, low prices are gone and now is the time to take some money off the table. There is a lesson here.",2024-09-29
"Shantanu Narayen Of ADBE sold apox 5% of his holdings, then holding more than $180M worth of stock left. This is NOT a move of anything near “Notable “",2024-09-29
"Seriously? Is this purchase worthy of a news item? Caldwell acquired 1,000 shares at $16.01 per share for a total of $16,009.",2024-09-28
"@UNCLEJUNIORSOPRANO Unless there is cluster selling, I pay more attention to the buys rather than the sells especially large or multiple purchases are especially bullish.",2024-09-28
@The New Generation I know that it is common for CEO’s to cash out with a 10b5-1 plan. I am bullish on AVGO and agree with BAC Merrill Lynch who projects a $215 Price Objective.,2024-09-28
@cpr1200r100 There aren't any NEWT preferreds.........all notes that pay interest not dividends,2024-09-28
I like that the CEO owns over a million shares and has been adding.But staring at my 30+% unrealized loss is tough.  Maybe ill sell 50% and trade into a Newt preferred.. something for me to think about.,2024-09-27
I am ALWAYS glad to see an article by Pacifica Yield and buy many of his recommendations.,2024-09-26
@Lainys grandpa I bought their new notes NEWTH but I agree the reward is better for the shares. I will wait for a better perception from the market maybe after a couple of good quarters.,2024-09-24
"Well done.I am surprised by the high yield they were willing to pay in their most recent issuance, but hope they have a good reason for it.(EDIT: Thank you for including the links to QuantumOnline)The PALT deal is interesting. PALT will have to divest of nearly all of their product lines as part of the deal, leaving essentially cash and NTS. Assuming goals are met, which Newtek is incentivized to cooperate with, Newtek will end up with 40% of PALT. Assuming a scenario where PALT ends up with $50 million in cash from the lawsuit, divestitures, and other sources, NEWT ultimately sold 60% of NTS for $24 million ($4 million up front and $20 million in equity). Considering the recent EBITDA of $2 million of NTS, they sold it for 20 times EBITDA. That seems decent when the whole company is trading for just over 6 times expected GAAP earnings.",2024-09-23
I made a lot of cash when the old BDC was hyped to over 30$ a share. Bought in 2020 for under 10 bucks and cashed some nice dividends along the way. It looks like now is a good time to buy my shares back. Thank you for bringing this company back on my watchlist and I will probably start a small position these days.

I initially sold NEWT when news went out about it's  conversion. Didn't do badly as I had gotten in a a reasonable price and been collecting dividends.  Bought back into this holding at a price close to it's current price and have dripped it's dividends.  Will be holding for the long term as I believe time is on my side. Will see if a heavily invested management knows what they're doing!,2024-09-23
"@Tim aWalz's Family Loves Trump Yep - not only that but while regional banks have fallen out of favour everyone wants private credit, that and of course their premium to NAV meant they could have raised a lot of equity",2024-09-19
I remember a certain analyst and his years of experience giving this a 32 dollar price target and was his largest holding.,2024-09-19
@Will104 Whats interesting is the timing of their conversion.  As regional banks are getting hit with bank runs and going bankrupt these guys are trying to convert to a bank.  Awful timing.,2024-09-19
