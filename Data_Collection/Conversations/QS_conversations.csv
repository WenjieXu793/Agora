"@Stephen Tobin The new CEO of Powerco was a VW QS board member prior to the agreement.  I think people are staking their reputation and these are smart people.  Conjecture on my part, certainly this move implies something beyond a basic investment.",2024-09-29
"@Martin Chuzzlewhit @Nelson Alves Good question. I tagged Mr Alves. The ability to reach profitability is faster (if they can actually produce a product at scale) with licensing but their long-term profits will be lower. Mr Alves, can you add a short article with updated long-term profits/revenues (Top and bottom line) along with stock share estimates",2024-09-29
@SummitNJ great point. I think that’s part of why Toyota likes its NiMH battery. It’s an excellent battery in this regard.,2024-09-28
"@SummitNJ  Very interesting.  Thanks.  If you’re correct that 2027 cars are finalized and contracts are signed, the California regs will be similar LIBs to what we have today.  They are still gaining market share, and using your California numbers EVs need a 9% annual growth rate.  Looked at another way, something like 28% (assuming additional 10% PHEV) would need to accept offerings similar to today.  Norway and China are past this or at it.  New battery advancements in 2028-2030 with 20-30% better range would help assure meeting this 2030 California regulation.  I agree the other “California states” are much more dubious.  If they are 12% today (US average is less, maybe 7%) getting to 38% EVs in 2030 is an annual rate of 20%.  That seems a real stretch for today’s EVs.  If your timing for advanced technologies is correct, these ~dozen states will need to relax the regulation.",2024-09-27
"@balaclava  Did you mean Sila or Silane?   If Sila Nanotechnology  30% Si anodes are $20/kg in high volume, that is $4/kWh, or half the cost of current anodes. If you meant silane, we are similar. I used $20/kg for silane and got $10-15/kWh for the anode material.The Meta AI on CVD costs are similar to what I got and used - $20/kg precursors are 30% of total cost.",2024-09-27
@JohnsonTV okay i rephrased the question about sila nano specifically and got thisCost per Kilogram (dependent on production volume):•⁠  ⁠Low volume (<100 kg/month): $50 - $100 per kilogram•⁠  ⁠Medium volume (100-1000 kg/month): $20 - $50 per kilogram•⁠  ⁠High volume (>1000 kg/month): $15 - $30 per kilogram,2024-09-27
"@JohnsonTV but the cost per kg of the CVD process?Meta AI says $20/kg for precursors, $50/kg for labor & energy of CVD processing.",2024-09-27
"@balaclava   A quick AI search for  Si CVD costs broke it down this way:  30-50% total cost in materials, processing 35%, balance other.  It’s a starting point. At 30% materials cost (most conservative), Si deposition into the carbon would be $5/kWh (silane at $20/kg or $1.50/kWh). Synthetic graphite is $12/kg (vs. $4-8/kg for natural graphite). If I did my arithmetic right, for a 30% Si anode in 70% synthetic graphite, Group 14 costs are somewhere between $10-$15/kWh, vs. ~$8/kWh for natural graphite anodes. New electrolyte costs need to be added to this $4/kWh difference.  Current electrolytes are $10/kWh.  Add 20% (guess), or $2/kWh for the new electrolyte, and I get nominally $6/kWh added on to current battery costs, or +5-10% $/kWh for the Group 14 approach versus today’s battery.  Argonne estimated SLDP’s cost as flat, but these seem within the “margin of error”, to use a contemporary term.",2024-09-27
"@funbrooklynite The $1.50/kWh difference is between bulk metallurgical silicon and electronics grade silicon from silane (at $20/kg silane).  You raise a good point, though.  Current anodes represent 10% of the cell cost.  Assuming cell costs are $80/kWh, this is $8/kWh.",2024-09-27
"@JohnsonTV Yes it's a good point about incremental and low-risk. The $25 is just for the silane. Then you have to do the chemical vapor deposition step. How much is that per kg?Forge Battery uses an Atomic Layer deposition technique for a protective layer, and then unstructured silicon.forgebattery.com/...spectrum.ieee.org/...These are all very mum on cost. So many efforts!",2024-09-27
"@balaclava  I misread the Group 14 announcement.  Sorry. The COMBINED capacity of the current Korean plant (10GWh, 2000 tonnes) and the US one (2025) will be 30GWh and 6000 tonnes. Both are at nominally 30% Si.",2024-09-27

"@balaclava As I understand the Amprius concept, they create carbon nanofibers and then deposit silicon on those fibers. I suspect this is through silane gas. It’s interesting to see $1-2 per kg for bulk metallurgical grade silicon, but I can’t imagine how impurities would be tolerated in an anode.  Even accepting this and the $25/kg for electronics grade silicon using silane, we’re only looking at $1.50/kWh difference.",2024-09-27
"@balaclava  I just got around to scanning your comments since yesterday.  You’ve been busy. I’ve been thinking about the premise of dropping in a high energy anode material into current electrolytes.  Your digging indicates this is required. Intuitively, you’re increasing the lithium ion “activity” (in the chemical sense) to make it more reactive.  As you mentioned, this changes the SEI dynamic at all interfaces. I can also see similar electron impacts at the current collectors. I believe many collectors have custom coatings. The punchline here is that enough changes are needed to warrant a full-fledged auto qualification process.Regarding EV OEM involvement, i’m not surprised there are no formal announcements. Group 14 is private and appears to be well-funded, so stealth is not surprising. No need on either side for announcements.  It seems Group 14 might be entering c-testing, wherein they’re scaling up manufacturing to provide full-production samples for qualification.On costs, even at $20/kg silane the Si costs around $1.50/kWh. That still didn’t strike me as being troublesome, especially if the carbon is impregnated using a fluidized bed. I don’t know how that compares to granular silicon like SLDP or others.  I can’t imagine the carbon being much more than synthetic graphite.  Anyway, you’re probably right that the trade-offs on cost, cell design, and application are not straightforward.  I keep coming back to my working thesis - small incremental changes and low risk are king. However, it is clear that high-energy density is needed to break open the next phase of the EV market.",2024-09-27
"@JohnsonTV Also consider this on Amprius from theinformation:I think it shows that high energy density cells are difficult to make, but if you use a smaller amount of silicon, you can get some increase in energy density without having other problems in the cell. Also you can see the silicon used in the cheaper cell is metallurgical grade ~ $1-2 / kg. That refinement step you quote is for electronics grade, which is much higher purity. silane gas is $20-30 / kg. SLDPs cell will show that similar cost advantage, as they do not require the scaffold. they use pressure instead.""While silicon anodes can store much more energy than conventional anodes, they swell and contract tremendously during the charge-discharge cycle, leading the battery to crack. In 2008, researchers at Stanford University pioneered the concept of silicon nanowires that accommodate the swelling, and launched Amprius to develop and manufacture batteries using them.But Amprius has struggled to reduce production costs and make its batteries last longer. The company’s current best battery model delivers almost twice the energy density of standard lithium-ion batteries but cycles only 150 to 200 times; to qualify for use in an electric vehicle, automakers require such batteries to deliver around 750 cycles.Meanwhile, Amprius has developed a cheaper silicon anode requiring less engineering. In 2022, it spun off a Chinese subsidiary, Berzelius, to make this anode, which features cheap metallurgical silicon. The Chinese contractors make these metallurgical silicon anodes.Amprius manufactures the nanowires on a small production line at its Fremont, Calif., headquarters. Customers for those batteries include Airbus, which uses them in its light Zephyr aircraft, which are high altitude platform stations.""",2024-09-27

"@JohnsonTV In order to support my view that cell makers need new cell designs to reach the full energy density gain of their silicon material, I did some digging:Group14's first major customer is CustomCells making cells for aircraft.
