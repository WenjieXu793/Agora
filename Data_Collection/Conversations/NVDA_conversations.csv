"@Cash Flow Venue I think concentration pays along years (time is the best performance maximizer and cost optimizer) if you invest in what you know; then, it depends on when you buy, I didn’t allocate 40% of my portfolio on $NVDA yesterday, I started 5 years ago and my average price is $28…and, I know…qualitative and quantitative elements, time horizon, objectives…investing is hard. Anyway, for a retail investor, starting with an equally weighted 20/25-stock portfolio is the safest way, or even ETF.Think, C. Munger had a 4-stock portfolio with ~45% on $BAC and ~45% on $WFC :-)",2024-10-06

"These words translate into dollars & profit: ""CEO Jensen Huang said this past week that demand for Nvidia’s new Blackwell GPUs is “insane.”Looking to the stock, SA analyst Cash Flow Venue calls it one of their favorite growth picks in the modern economy, saying: “You have to judge the tree by the fruit it provides, and let me assure you - NVIDIA provides outstanding EBITDA margins translating into its cash flow generating potential.”""",2024-10-06
"@SuperPac:  Presuming Powell / the Fed continues to be DATA based (AKA rational) about their moves, that's the best we can have. For example, ongoing evidence we aren't entering a recession (if the recent jobs data is a valid indication) should preclude ""too many"" rate cuts. I believe the experts at the Fed are MUCH more competent to make such decisions than a bazillion armchair pundits and political hacks that infest the internet with their emotional policy opinions, but few facts and VERY little actual math and economics.  That's why I never say ""the Fed should do X short term"".  Having lived through the inflation storm of the late 60's through early 80's, preventing anything close to THAT is job one by a country mile for the fed, IMO.",2024-10-06

"@Paul01x Yeah I saw that. At the same time, there are signs that many of the growth expectations are being priced in now. So I think it'll perform in-line with the S&P500 for a while before the next big alpha run.My ratings reflect my view on performance outlook vs the S&P500. I don't really mean 'Buy', 'Sell' 'Hold' per se as that's a very personal decision.",2024-10-06

"@ET180 - ""... inference has been based on large matrix multiplication many times.""Apparently the cost of AI inference with machines from Cerebras Systems (CS) is too high. Only a few very deep pockets can afford them. See link and quote below...https://tinyurl.com/3jw6vnpd (Next Platform - Cerebras Goes Hyperscale - 3/14/2024)""The one thing that Cerebras also does not do, except for unnamed three letter agencies that we can’t talk about, is AI inference. The CS machines are for AI training only unless you are Uncle Sam. And so, to bring the cost of inference down, which is high, Cerebras is partnering with Qualcomm on its Cloud AI 100 accelerator to provide a complete training and inference hardware stack.""How well this partnership with Qualcomm works remains to be seen. In the mean time the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE) processor is best suited for AI training. But WSE only has FP16 even though FP8 is becoming popular for AI. Data formats are not the only thing in flux. AI models will likely continue to change significantly. Cerebras WSE processors might not be sufficiently adaptable. See quote below.""With the WSE compute engines, you don’t have FP64 support with the CS systems, and you can’t do anything else with them, either. Like you really can’t with a Google TPU, either. That is the price you are paying for the Nvidia software stack and a more general purpose compute engine.""So Cerebras doesn't have enough general compute capability to do any other job effectively. There's no high precision for HPC. Training of AI models as currently conceived is the only thing it's good at. While matrix math for AI will likely always be necessary that might not be sufficient as models evolve. WSE lacks the flexibility of a GPU for future-proofing.Cerebras machines are optimized for the present AI paradigm. This makes them brittle.",2024-10-06

"When you run out of ideas go big.Cerebras is an example of that. Hugeness is often impressive. Same could be said about dinosaurs. Cerebras tech takes 2D semi to the limit with wafer scale. Size is the last phase of innovation. Aside from scale, the Cerebras machine is FP16 and relies heavily on sparsity for high performance. You can't do anything else with a Cerebras machine other than massive matrix math to implement the current conception of AI.Future of semi is 3D. AI models will evolve. GPU is flexible.

"@Rhoda711 That supply is functionally an ore, that gets processed many months later into ingots.  As long as they get the road re-opened by spring it won't have any impact.""On Friday, the company said its final product stock “has not been impacted” by the storm. “We are working closely with our customers to assess their needs and plan the restart of product shipments as soon as we can,” Sibelco said.""www.newsobserver.com/...It's not expected to affect chip manufacturers but extremely price sensitive sectors like solar panels could see minor impacts.

"@RUBYRUBY3 I happened to notice a few weeks ago a few large cranes at the SEH America facility (Shin-Etsu) in Vancouver, Wa. There has been an expansion at this plant that supplies the semiconductor industry with wafers. This project (super X) is about a year into its progress. From what information I have gathered any disruption should be short lived. There appears to be enough silica quartz stockpiled and alternate smaller supply methods to cover any impact.Toyocom has a synthetic crystal facility in Longview, WaSiltronic has a wafer facility (material is from Germany) in Portland, OrThere are several others I would surmise there is enough alternatives that a 3-5 month delay from these mines would not seriously impact the industry for the short term. This could obviously change as additional information comes to light.",2024-10-05
