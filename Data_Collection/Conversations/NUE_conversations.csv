"@podniem Nucor may bounce back from the industry downturn stronger than most, since it has maintained industry-leading margins for about a decade among large global steelmakers, and has the potential to significantly increase its market share in the steel industry in the long term seekingalpha.com/...",2024-09-25
"Nucor is easily the best steel maker in the World right now so very much on sale here suddenly and should be acquired added to going into Year end 2024 especially given the antics surrounding $x US Steel as iron ore prices continue to plunge and scrap metal is crazy valuable here. Long $slb slumberger strong buy as oil prices appear set to remain elevated into Year end 2024 and offshore oil drilling uses a crazy amount of steel.

"@podniem I generally take a 5-10 year approach with articles and investments, so that horizon, at a minimum, is my ""long term"". No idea what happens in the next 1-3 years, can't time markets or stocks worth anything. All I know is what all steel watchers have said - that the industry is about to hit a price slump, and that the global players will take a hit from it. Nucor seems poised to do quite well in the short term, and perhaps among the best in the long term, hence my buy rating. Can't say much on entry points or the like, that's more in the area of technical trading and sentiment analysis, whereas I'm more in tune with fundamental matters.",2024-09-19

"@oakraid We can agree on politics being at play to a degree here, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Politics is just the doling out of decisions related to power/influence and resources. It factors into many things, like economic plans and fiscal or monetary decisions. M&A bids, and M&A rejections, can certainly be influenced by politics, no question. But in this specific case, Biden, Harris, and Trump all vowing to block a US Steel buyout by Nippon doesn't mean they all want Cliffs to buy US Steel instead. Cliffs has already tried and failed to buy US Steel before, and most observers think Cliffs doesn't have the financial ability to buy up US Steel even if they wanted to. It could be that Biden Harris and Trump don't want US Steel bought up at all. To see a longstanding industry titan with America's name on it absorbed by another company might be fundamentally disheartening to them, and possibly coloring their political calculus. But frankly, I think there is greater politics at play here, politics that are a bit different from what the article suggests. To take a larger view of the article and its assertions, the writer asserts three things: first, the US in recent decades has been a proponent of free trade around the globe, putting pure economics and opportunities for cheap global trade over domestic politics and geopolitics (globalization); second, the US's love of free trade and willingness to downgrade or ignore the influence of geopolitics in economic matters has led other nations to trade favorably with the US over other nations; and third, if the US becomes critical or is now critical of global trade and doesn't trade as freely with the world, foreign investment in the US would drop and negatively affect the country.I think the writer exaggerates a bit. The US CHIPS Act www.cfr.org/... and Inflation Reduction Act finance.yahoo.com/... have done very well to encourage companies to invest in the US and get a share of the subsidies America is offering for semiconductor fabs and green energy technologies. So foreign investment in the US is far from in peril.But here's the thing - the article's basic premise, the implications, and the US's response, are all correct. The US actively ignored geopolitical wisdom and domestic political protests in favor of free trade, empowering and enriching China by driving other countries to trade with it and make it a lynchpin in the world's manufacturing base while using its cheap labor to drive down the cost of global (and America's imported and foreign-made) goods. What did that do? It resulted in significant offshoring of American jobs to China and other countries in the world, while driving more money and investment to China that the the Chinese gov has no doubt spent on increasing its ability to interfere with American interests and disrupt the stability of the rules-based international order; this is likely in a bid to take America's place as global hegemon and subject much of the world to China's demands and interests. The US's globalization helped move China further along in that pursuit to America's own geopolitical detriment, while sacrificing many American laborers at the alter of comparative advantage. Globalization was a strange and foolhardy experiment, and its end is overdue. Free trade and offshoring should be replaced by reshoring, nearshoring, and friendshoring - we should only be trading only with reliable and trusted allies, and providing jobs to our own citizens or creating new ones where possible. And indeed, friendshoring has taken off www.msci.com/... ,  with the supply chain issues from Covid and the Russian invasion of Ukraine demonstrating to companies around the world why trusting their supply chains to single countries, particularly authoritarian and autocratic countries like China or in some cases Russia, is ill-advised. But as US Steel/Nippon deal drama demonstrates, some industries and sectors are resistant to friendshoring. The geopolitical calculus might be that it is in America's interest to have full territorial control over a resource as critical as steel, and full control over steel manufacturers in the US. US steelworkers keeping their jobs and union might simply be a positive domestic political side benefit. If this is the calculus, the reasoning and logic are sound to me. US Steel is better in US hands, be that its own hands or the hands of another American firm. Steelmaking capacity is too important for an industrial powerhouse to simply give away to someone else, even a trusted ally. Also, if both Nippon and Cliffs are blocked from buying US Steel, be it from national security concerns or antitrust concerns, US Steel will have no choice but to fundamentally improve its operations and profitability to compete with competitors like Nucor and survive the steel price crisis. The article writer was wringing his hands over America being insufficiently committed to market forces and free trade nowadays, but what's more free market than letting a steel company sink or swim on its own merits? In sum, I think Nucor, X, NPSCY, CLF, and all the other steel players are being affected by politics, and that it's not really a big problem. I also think the article's fears that America is scaring off foreign investment in its new push to deglobalize are overblown, and that America's new approach to the problem is correct, since it takes much better account of critical political and geopolitical factors that globalization did not consider important.",2024-09-16
"It seems politics is also at play in this industry:When a Steel Deal Isn't Tempered for D.C.Nippon Steel's Bid to Buy U.S. Steel and the Disastrous Absurdities of PoliticsLAU VEGYSSEP 10 With the Harris-Trump presidential debate just hours away, it's the perfect time to discuss a particular episode that I’ve been meaning to bring to your attention. Now, I'm not going to pretend this is going to be a hot-button issue tonight... but it really encapsulates the current state of American politics and how both of the parties are in many ways just two sides of the same coin.And it all revolves around a little something called steel.A $14.9 Billion Bet on American SteelRoughly a year ago, Japan's steel giant Nippon Steel (TYO: 5401) made an offer to acquire its struggling American counterpart, U.S. Steel (X). The primary reason behind Nippon's desire to buy out U.S. Steel can be summed up in one word: China.For years, Nippon's margins have been suffering from competition with Chinese steelmakers. The company has been trying to stay afloat in a sea of cheap Chinese steel. Much like U.S. Steel...Enter Nippon’s proposed $14.9-billion takeover.The deal would inject $2.7 billion to refurbish the Pittsburgh steelmaker's aging plants. It would create a stronger entity with reduced costs, increased efficiency, and higher market share to compete against Chinese manufacturers, who benefit from lower wages, fewer labor restrictions, and government subsidies.A company from a trusted ally swoops in to buy your ailing firm to compete with your main geopolitical rival. What’s not to like?Good Deal, Bad Politics Apparently, quite a bit, according to the Biden Administration.As I write this, President Joe Biden is preparing to announce that he will formally block Nippon Steel's proposed $14.9 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel.Their stated reason is as puzzling as Biden's never-ending gaffes: ""national security concerns.""Now, unless you've been living under a rock, you probably know that Japan has been one of America's closest allies for decades. And it's becoming an increasingly important one as the U.S. relationship with China grows more adversarial. You'd think Biden would have moved past the whole Pearl Harbor thing by now.And it doesn't help that Nippon's deal is actually very generous—more than twice the current market capitalization of U.S. Steel. Or that it agreed to honor U.S. Steel's collective bargaining agreements with the United Steelworkers.As you might have guessed, the actual reason for blocking the merger has little to do with national security.You see, another U.S. steel company, Cleveland Cliffs (CLF), submitted a rival bid to acquire U.S. Steel for roughly half of Nippon's offer. Yes, you read that right—half.It just so happens that Cleveland Cliffs' CEO, Lourenco Goncalves, is a staunch union advocate and a friend of the Biden Administration. He aims to create a domestic cartel protected from competition by the 25% steel tariffs (originally imposed by Trump and maintained by Biden).So, needless to say, the administration likes this deal better, despite the steep discount.Goncalves has been pushing the narrative of a national security threat, even going so far as to say that ""Japan is not a friend."" The upshot? The Nippon Steel deal is as good as dead at this point...This means Cleveland Cliffs will probably scoop up U.S. Steel at a huge discount, thanks to its CEO's political connections, and we’ll end up with a genuine steel monopoly in the U.S.Political Look-alikesSo, instead of preventing monopolies, the Biden Administration is actively helping to create one... And rather than upholding the principles of open markets — yes, I know, shocking — they're wholeheartedly embracing economic protectionism.But that’s to be expected from the likes of Biden and Kamala.What’s more surprising is that Donald Trump and JD Vance are also against Nippon's acquisition of U.S. Steel. In fact, Trump himself promised to block the deal back in January.It's frankly mind-boggling; Nippon is ready to invest billions in America to revitalize its aging steel industry and make it more competitive. Yet politicians on both sides of the aisle are lining up against it.This will definitely make other foreign companies think twice about investing in the U.S.But the bigger picture here is even more significant. For decades, the U.S. has been a proponent of free trade and open markets, based on the (accurate) belief that they create wealth for investors, keep prices low for consumers, and generate jobs for the working class.The pushback against the Nippon Steel deal hints at a major shift in that mindset… not that it has been on solid ground lately anyway. And, again, it's coming from both sides of the political aisle... something Trump and Kamala would no doubt confirm in tonight's debate if asked.Time and again, we're reminded: on the issues that really count, both sides couldn't be more alike.Regards,Lau VegysDoug Casey's Crisis Investing is a reader-supported publication.

"Additional detail on Nucor's business operations relevant to the article:If it is true that EAFs are the future of steel, Nucor has a big opportunity as an EAF leader to rapidly gain market share in the steel market, which will require growing its production facilities. Nucor is apparently up to the challenge, as the company is investing over $3 billion into a huge facility in West Virginia, the biggest investment in the state's history. www.wvnews.com/... The facility will produce 3 millions of tons of steel (enough to stay competitive in steel volumes against its rival US Steel). However, Nucor's new site will also create ~800 permanent manufacturing jobs and up to 20,000 jobs in the surrounding area. Such a big impact with surely be felt in a state that is struggling to conduct a 'just transition' of its economy from coal and other fossil fuels to clean energy www.brookings.edu/... . Nucor's sustainable steel hub will go a long way in helping the state complete that transition. In the West Virginia project, but also its operations as a whole, Nucor appears highly committed to growing and expanding its position in the steel industry, and thereby cementing its status as a leading, if not *the* leading, EAF steelmaker worldwide.",2024-09-13

"@Stephen Tobin Thanks for reading, glad you enjoyed it! Indeed, the onshoring trend represents a big and broad risk to Chinese steel demand, its days as the world's factory are nearing an end. I suspect that onshoring and friendshoring will happen in the EU too, though I am uncertain to what degree and whether European steel will be part of it. Yes, Nucor's green credentials will be a big asset in the steel industry, that alone should act as a buffer for preserving its market share as #1 US steelmaker by volume. It has potential to usurp MT to become the largest non-Chinese steelmaker globally if it plays its cards right, but that's too speculative for now. Bright future for Nucor nonetheless, though, which is good for NUE stockholders.",2024-09-13
"@Sisyphus7 The only way I see steel prices staying relatively favorable is if North America blocks the Chinese steel glut from the continent and bucks the rest of the global market pricing. Which I suppose could happen, but I don't think I'd bet on it. Cliffs' strategy of buying up blast furnaces seems fundamentally poor long term. Furnaces running on nat gas will not be sufficiently emissions-friendly compared to EAFs to be ignored by possible future regulatory measures mandating broad decarbonization and a net zeroing of the steel industry. Furnaces running on green hydrogen is a different story, though. As long as it requires few or no carbon emissions, I think it could keep the green energy monkey off the company's back. But even so, generating green hydrogen is probably a lot less efficient than using renewable or nuclear power like Nucor is aiming to do. And EAFs as I understand it are easier to operate, more precise in melting steel down, and do not require continuous operations compared to blast furnaces. Even if Cliffs plans to slowly make its way to a low-emissions blast furnace strategy, it may still be more expensive or less environmentally friendly compared to EAF usage. And I am unaware of Cliffs' CEO planning such a transition for the company's blast furnaces, it seems to me he is more interested in getting them from struggling steelmakers at a discount. Discounts aren't necessarily good deals - ask any buyer of a lemon car. Good chance Cliffs is buying soon-to-be stranded assets if EAFs take over the steel industry long term.",2024-09-12
"@Ray Merola Glad you liked the article! As far as how and when the price crisis will end and where the price bottom will be, I have no idea for certain; timing market trends is as hard for me as timing markets, especially in the short term. If I had to guess, though, I would say we are in the relatively early innings of the ordeal. Big steel industry observers and institutional investors are only now informing the world of the growing Chinese oversupply issue, even though it probably could have been predicted in 2022 when Evergrande exposed the rot in the Chinese property sector. There is good reason to believe that things in China are far less rosy than the official government numbers would have the world believe, and I don't just mean the property stats, I'm talking about the overall economic data. I think the only demand buffers for the Chinese steel industry will be EVs, green energy, possibly robots, some data centers, and maybe military equipment. But these are longer term demand sources, so several of these will either kick in years down the line, or may not generate as much steel demand as expected, meaning even long term steel demand in China may be a bit exaggerated. That is to say, long term recovery of steel demand in China may take longer than expected, meaning the steel price situation for global steelmakers could last longer than some of them can comfortably withstand it.The one thing I'm sure of is that in the near term, Chinese steel excess should be absorbed (or maybe blocked?) by the global industry, prices will respond accordingly, and the less profitable or the otherwise less financially secure steelmakers will have difficulties getting through it if absorption of the excess occurs. Hope that helps, and good work on your NUE article a while back!",2024-09-12
"@Matt-G Indeed, another bullish feature of Nucor's business. Happy employees can be more productive, and are probably more loyal. Better efficiency seen in reduced man-hours/ton could be due to the EAF-based nature of the business, since blast furnaces have to be operated 24/7. All positive in any case.",2024-09-12
Nucor has a massive facility planned for West Virginia so maybe start with that next time as this is the largest investment in the History of West Virginia been being made with that which of course once fully operational will put enormous downward pressure on steel prices,2024-09-12
"While your article is broadly solid, I think you’re missing the environmental strategy Cliffs is using to bring down emissions from blast furnace steel production.  They’ve already switched over to natgas for a number of their facilities, and recently have been working on the first hydrogen-based blast furnace.  The latter is expected to produce steel with lower emissions and higher quality than EAFs.Cliffs has its challenges, as you note in the article.  Since escaping a near bankruptcy about a decade ago, they’ve used industry downturns to boost market share, especially in automotive and electrical steel.  That’s left them with a lot of assets and a lot of debt.  I think we’ll see a swing back to a more favorable North American steel price soon, and Cliffs will benefit greatly, but it’s a higher risk play.",2024-09-12
"Thank you for an outstanding article about the steel industry and specifically Nucor.  I appreciate the in-depth analysis and business understanding.For many years, China has been a problem for the steel industry.  Continually, they ignore WTO rules, game the system, and dump subsidized, illegally produced steel into the United States.  Nucor management has long argued that global free trade is welcomed, but that includes *fair* trade.  Question: Where do you believe we are in the steel price down cycle, as outlined in this excerpt from the article: ""Steel prices are likely to see a large and steady fall, as China produces more than half of the world’s steel, so the profitability of global steelmakers will probably see a large fall as well.""Would you care to quantify by $/ton or percentages (or just qualify) the lowball endgame here?",2024-09-12
"Excellent article and summary of the competing processes/technologies.  Another key ingredient in NUE's success is stakeholder alignment, especially the employees.  They are rewarded well for performing well, something that the legacy producers and unions (primarily USW) have not been able to reproduce.  X realizes this in its Big River Steel investments.  NUE and STLD have the lowest man-hours/ton in the business.  Some of that is due to management and technology and some of that is due to employee engagement and its fruits.  They have built it into a sustainable advantage.",2024-09-12
