@rabblerouser it’s just different numbers. Numbers are relative. % gain is the same. Do you understand that?This is a weird post.,2024-09-24
"""But this was also the case in early 2018, when the stock was priced near $150/share. Today, it trades over $480/share. So, while ISRG may not be the best short-term trade, it is a sound long-term investment.""Excuse me? I believe there was a 3 for 1 stock split in October 2017, and a second 3 for 1 stock split in October 2021.  In both cases the pre split ISRG stock price exceeded $1000.00.Looking at my notes The ... three for one split was announced August 14th 2017.   on September 11th 2017 the pre split stock price was $1,045.46 a share.  On 7/8/2018 it was $495.46 a share post split.  “Intuitive Board Of Directors Approves A Three-For-One Stock Split BY Reuters— 10:14 AM ET 08/05/2021”   On August 6 2021 the stock price was $1,030.02 a share pre the 2021 3 for 1 stock split.  My notes show ISRG closing stock price Monday Oct 4, 2021 pre split was $970.50.  The next morning it was trading in the Pre market hours at $326.31 post split. Digging more the price declined to a low of $186.83 a post split share and has been working its way back up since to the $480 level.  The drop in 2022  was a great opportunity to acquire ISRG as was the GLP1 weight loss brouhaha  in late summer and fall of 2023.My latest posting in a thread called ""Riding the Lightning"" on another website -""This thread was started in the fall of 2017 on 9/12/2017 before the 3:1 stock split on October 6th. The price was $1045 a share that day. It has been a wild ride since then, and it isn’t over yet.""",2024-09-24
"ISRG has been perennially expensive for more than a decade, but I agree with you in this case since it has moved up 2.5x the price at which it traded in July of this year.",2024-09-24
