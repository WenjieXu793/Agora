@Rhoda711 They converted from a Trust to a C Corp in January 2021.,2024-10-05
"@rabblerouser Three weeks later WTIC and Brent are down about 5% from where they were on June 7th and TPL stock is up about 70% [I am not complaining].  Horizon Kinetics must be doing the Happy Dance. BTW the latest days to cover for the shorts after the first two weeks of September is 19.31 on an average daily volume of 71,055 share per day.",2024-10-04
@HPBunker It has to be oil operations will move into TPL acreage as development of the field continues. It's hard to understand such a price paid  for so small a parcel. @Krypto have any ideas on this TPL buy?,2024-10-03
"@HPBunker It sure makes VTLE's buy of 86,000 Delaware basin acres for 880M cash all in look like a bargain. And Wall Street hated that buy. I think Wall Street missed that one. Plus they have cheap smaller lot bolt-on acreage available.",2024-10-03
"@HPBunker Acreage is quit small 7500. Look like this deal is along the same line as when TELL paid 150M cash all in for 5,000 Haynesville acres a couple years ago. Surely it will have better cashflow than the TELL buy.",2024-10-03
"Isn't any currently producing collection of Permian royalty interests going to fall in production rapidly, just due to the nature of fracked wells?  I'm concerned that a deal like this, that seems expensive at its outset, is only going to seem more expensive as production falls.There's also zero doubt that simply buying back shares at (adjusting for the split) $400 for several months in 2023 would have been a vastly better use of shareholder capital.  Instead, the board accumulated cash on the balance sheet and then... did this.",2024-10-03
"I'd be curious if DMLP took a look at this...  As mentioned, perhaps it was too rich a price?  A nice collection of assets though.",2024-10-03
"@BIZUN1973 just spitballing here, but i would be hard pressed to believe TPL with decades of experience in these fields is going to get screwed.  also, even if they did, it represents 1.3% of their market cap.  this is probably a nice tuck-in acquisition with potential for increasing economies of scale with the adjacent holdings.",2024-10-02
"@idahoradm I agree.  7,490 acres and 1,380 boe/day?  Either these acres haven’t been developed yet or $TPL got screwed.",2024-10-02
"That’s $38,000 per acre. Could be a little high? At 1300 boe/day for a year, at $70 oil, that's about a 12% return for one year for all involved, TPL only receives 20 to 25% royalty. So the 12% return becomes less than 3% return.",2024-10-02
TPL represents a great stock and a great company.  Longz!  :-),2024-09-25
"I own TPL in all 3 of my investing accounts.  I'm up between 50-75% in the three accounts.  The 75% up account is because I added on TPL's price pull back.  My holding period in all 3 accounts is less than one year.  I last added when the stock was trading at $800@.  I'd be a little hesitant to add at these prices.  However, if the stock corrects to $800@, I would add to all three positions.  Thanks for your article.",2024-09-25
"@RobnE Stock split will turn the stock more volatile. I say “ things are great so don’t change them “. Divvy only in a few years when growth decreases exponentially. Until this baby hits a 2x or a 3x from here, I would like it to stay as it is :)",2024-09-25
@PauloCostaSilva very cool. I am in a lil higher than you but still under 200. I hope in the next 24 months or so they do a stock split. Then eventually a dividend.,2024-09-25
@builderscott TPL have been working at the solar leasing for a while I believe they have a team dedicated to that endeavor.  The link was the second response to a Google Search.tpltblog.com/...,2024-09-24
"@PauloCostaSilva I agree 100% with you. Compensate the team for exceptional performance and it’s a win every time. I am totally for performance based compensation. Trying to find some extra cash to add to my TPL and LB. Might have to go pick up pop cans along the road …..If you like this style of company, check out AXON. The CEO changed his pay to 1$ a year and the rest in shares based on performance milestones. And he opened the same option to other employees…… that company is on a roll. And they are barely getting started. Leo …. You should do an update on this company next month.",2024-09-24
"@JJJRS Goose Hollow Investments was correct about the mineral rights.  The surface rights are limited just to the ground level.  As a practical matter there is limited use to below ground level to support houses, power lines, roads etc.  The holder of the mineral rights has to work out an agreement with the holder of the surface rights to be able to bring equipment, roads, power lines and pipe lines to where the well will drilled.  The holder of the mineral rights has to pay the holder of the surface rights for access etc. even if it turns out to be a dry hole.  TPL makes substantial income by charging companies for crossing its land.  Check out TPL's web cite and financial statements for more details.   Just a thought or two.",2024-09-18
"What I am not seeing in this analysis is that TPL's Business model changed twice in the last 10 years. Before 2017 it had 10 employees, and its major activities were the sale of land 3 million acres in 1870 [I believe] to the current level of less than a million acres, and share buybacks reducing the number of units of the TPL Trust. I believe the trust income was primarily from oil and gas royalties and the sale of land.  The water business was started in 2017 by the TPL Trust and resulted in a significant increase in the headcount to the current level approaching 100. That is the first change in the business model.  The second was the ending of the Texas Pacific Land Trust in 2021 and the conversion to the current Ccorp model. with an elected Board of Directors vs the Trust with three Trustees who served for their lifetimes and 3 annual meetings in the last 20 years.  I believe this is all well documented on the TPL website. The 3 for 1 stock split in March 2024 may have had some unintended consequences.  Increasing the share count from 7.66M to 22.95M in the public float appears to have allowed TPL to join the SP400 index and also resulted in increased interest from the short sellers.  According to FINRA data the percent short interest increased from a mid-three percent range before the split to in excess of six percent in the last two weeks of June.  The unintended consequence is the days to cover the short position is now in the double digits with a high of 16.67 days in the last two weeks of July. As you are probably well aware TPL's stock price is up about 40% since the announcement of TPL joining the SP400 index on about June 7th what you may not be aware of is that the price of WTIC and Brent oil has declined about 15% in the same time span.",2024-09-15
@ChubbyCharles approx 30% by my calculations at the current time. But I will update the target after next report.,2024-09-15
"I own the company, and I'm dripping it.  I plan to hold it indefinitely, and if it drops to $600, I'll buy another 25% of my holding.",2024-09-15
