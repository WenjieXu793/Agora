"@Rob G. in Vegas thanks yes, I did start going over it but there is a lot to digest. I would look at annual cash flows as there is seasonality in SUI's business, still it is interesting to see how the company responds. Perhaps I would look at whether SUI reports larger free cash flow /AFFO+interest+preferred dividend/ to Enterprise value relative to peers, perhaps as a proportion of revenue. Good luck ",2024-09-25
It happened again.  Blue Orca announces a new short position on one of Brad's REIT Buys.  I read the short analysis and did not find it that compelling.www.blueorcacapital.com/...,2024-09-25
"@Ivo Kolchev Short thesis is mostly about how SUI plays games with ""recurring"" versus ""non-recurring"" capital expenditures when they report AFFO.  Lots of REITs do this but SUI is extremely aggressive.You can't hide those games in the Statement of Cash Flows.  If one looks solely at that statement from SUI's 2Q 2024 10Q, SUI does not even cover its paltry $.94 quarterly common dividend (only a 2.75% yield) with free cash flow.",2024-09-25
"@Druvaciam Aleh interesting thanks, I will check it out once their site loads :) link is here www.blueorcacapital.com/...",2024-09-25
The stock is selling hard. Short report announced by Blue Orca,2024-09-25
"@user8289 yup you are totally right, with spreads so wide you should always use limit orders and ideally hold to maturity/what I usually do 95% of the time/. Thanks for highlighting this and good luck",2024-09-23
"Good coverage of SUI. My only criticism is that there is very little open interest in the next two expiry’s, and there is no volume. The bid-ask spreads of the 145 and 150 strikes is $4 wide. It’s possible to get a fill, but you should be extremely careful with limit orders and I would not try to cover before expiration. I typically like to roll short calls and puts, but a hold until expiration is the right strategy here if you can get a decent fill within $0.20 of mid-price.",2024-09-23
SPG will cruise past all time high then do a forward stock split,2024-09-17
SLG was easy money for awhileBut now the upside is baked inI held my nose to buy because NYC ain’t what it used to beTip: Much better and safer places to go on vacation,2024-09-16
"Well, if a 188.88% gain on SLG that has taken place with an ‘underperform’ rating that only just now shifted to ‘in line’, someone really missed the boat here.That someone wasn’t me. I really wish that all of my shares ‘underperformed’ like this.",2024-09-16
