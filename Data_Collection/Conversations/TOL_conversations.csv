@bigfish1977 I know but a long time ago I researched LOW and HD.  It was when HD was having problems with Nardelli as CEO.  I picked LOW to start a position and I've added to it on dips.  HD eventually did get its act together.  Both are attractive.,2024-09-18

"Does Barry the ceo of PSEC have to buy more shares every single day???? He was rude to the shareolders at the Conf call and even though the news was good - he gave many shareholders attitude.  I can whine cause i bought a bunch at $4.75-85 but I planned on buying even more.  Everytime I set a price Barry comes in and buys more and literally millions.  This guy is something else, not sure I've seen anything like it in over 50 years of investing.  I'd love to be able to call him and ask if he plans to stop but I over-react to rude people.",2024-09-12

@dlevine007 I see rates getting that low too although I'm not sure there will be much of a move lower in the overall housing market.  As rates drop more buyers will come into the market and those buyers include foreign and corporate as well.,2024-09-11
