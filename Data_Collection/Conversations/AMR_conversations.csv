10yr growth rate of 15%. Please explain. Is that 15% cumulative or less than inflation? 15% cumulative in real dollars? Is it 15% annually?,2024-10-02
@William Walsh I am actually sitting tight for just that reason. Selling covered calls while waiting.,2024-10-02
"@Energy Alpha I agree, but then you are trying to time the market. Too hard for me. I like to purchase positions in tranches. Selling some Naked PUTs on the stock may also be rewarding since the ImpVol is high and offering nice premiums.",2024-10-02
@jamesn84 Too bad! Up 25% since the article was published less than a month ago :-),2024-09-30
"I was waiting for the next quarter to buy more AMR but this share has done a good bounce back too soon, grrr",2024-09-27
@jamesn84 Everyone saw China's real estate bubble collapse is coming. It was obvious for many years. Its prices are more ridiculous that US ones in 2007.,2024-09-19
"@Druvaciam Aleh I think it's more like they couldn't see that coal bear market was coming back then, no one could have seen the collapse of China's real estate.Q1 and Q2, ARCH and CEIX have been using 80%+ of their FCF in buying back shares while AMR didn't buy back much. Instead AMR only bought a small amount and building cash to protect their franchise.This is a good thing IMO. Now share price is even cheaper, it's a better time for buyback compared to Q1 and Q2. So I'd give management credit on this.",2024-09-19
"I don't think this is clear. Look at the chart of iron ore; it's back to pandemic lows. That feeds right into met coal demand.My guess is that India, Indonesia etc will pick up much of China's slack, but not all. The Chinese overbuild on structures and infrastructure was incredible and wasteful. Others have learned the lesson.",2024-09-12
"@AlphaSierra It is value destruction. $DG did the same, bought a ton of shares at all time high. And now can buy a single share. Incompetent management.",2024-09-11
"@AlphaSierra one cannot blame them too much for this. If you look at the met coal space. They set the trend on the buybacks when the met coal prices are high and first to stop the buybacks when they sensed weakness in the met coal prices. They aren't lossing any money yet, they are preserving cash which is accumulating on the balance sheet. When met coal prices turn around or when. They have enough cash buybacks will again kick in.",2024-09-10
@valentin.pal India is the only customer of AMR with more than 10 % revenue share in 2023. So China accounts for less than 10 % of revenue.,2024-09-10
Not tell happy about their capital allocation regarding share repurchases. The bought back at all time highs and are now limiting any repurchases at more than 50% lower prices,2024-09-10
"@Queen Anne Investor Mining costs are not the only relevant cost factor. It’s more about the mining result, shipping costs & time",2024-09-10
@Stock Scanner But you reference buybacks in regard to the Q2 earnings.  It's confusing because the buybacks stopped after Q1.,2024-09-10
@Tradedollarnut  and at today’s prices what would be their profit for the 75% remaining? What I have trouble understanding is what coal futures curve or index I should look at to get an idea of the selling price.,2024-09-10
"IMHO, China steel making sector is about to collapse permanently. Rest of the world cannot absorb China's steel capacity so it will most likely be significantly curtailed.  Moreover, I expect that new India steel fabs are more likely to go with DRI and initially crack LNG to make hydrogen to replace metallurgical coal process.  That way, in the long run they could use green hydrogen as they ramp up solar plus battery power nationally over the coming decades.The countries replacing China are not going to be building crazy oversupply of infrastructure like China did.  So, from what I can tell global steel demand is going to be structurally flat to down over the coming years, no need to even mention the coming global deep recession and China's impending economic collapse.",2024-09-09
"@Queen Anne Investor No, Hcc is lower cost. They include their shipping to port in their costs whereas AMR does not",2024-09-09
I like companies with minimal debt and strong FCF. My only hesitation with AMR is that it is dependent on commodity prices which it has no control over. Does anyone have a grasp of which companies are the low cost producers? I believe AMR is more efficient than HCC. Also if I am not mistaken the world has no issues with met coal (unlike thermal coal) so there is not an existential crisis for met coal producers. The same cannot be said for CEIX and ARCH. Under $200 is a big bargain IMO. I suspect it will not stay for long.,2024-09-09
@Jonah007 they typically lock in about 4Mt [25% of production] with domestic steel companies for the year ahead. The price will be announced in November during Q3 earnings release. It should be around $150 giving them a locked in gross profit of appx $200M.,2024-09-09
@Stock Scanner  and nothing locked for 2025? Should coking coal prices remain at today’s prices (lowest in a few  years) what will revenue/ fcf on ops be?,2024-09-09
