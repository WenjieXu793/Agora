"Zillow just announced that they will now list homes that are a climate risk.  16.7 percent have a risk of flooding and 12.8% have a risk of wildfire.  This will cause huge price swings in the existing home and future sales.  What's next, how about climate change impacts that could compromise the water supply like Las Vegas?",2024-09-27
"@Centsible Investor I agree with your thoughts. When I bought my home, I was paying 11% interest and $1,000 a month, in 1984. This was a lot of money at that time. I worked for around $7.50 an hour plus delivered pizza and anything else I could do to make it. I paid the house off in three and a half years because I would put the extra money I made towards paying down the house. This allowed me to save money and invest. If I had stayed in an apartment which at that time rent was around $250 a month I would now be paying over $2,000 a month. So many today do not want to work that hard, but it pays off. There are expenses related to home ownership, but they are not as much as the overall cost of renting. I think that many today forget that rent is not stagnant and goes up over time, which takes away more money as time goes on. While home ownership holds your purchase cost flat giving you in time more money to either spend and or invest.",2024-09-27
"@PapaWhisky Incorrect. I've lived through stretching to buy, I've had clients that did so, children that did so. The results were remarkably consistent. Over the short term, you're house poor. Over the medium term, you're fine. Over the long term, you're way ahead.",2024-09-27

"Used to be if I sold my house and rolled the proceeds into a new home, I paid no tax. Now you get a 250k per person exemption and then you pay the cap gains rate. Considering the average price of homes is twice that, If I sold and paid the tax exemption or no exemption, I couldn't afford the same house. Now add the mortgage rate and forget it. Pays to stay in the one that brung you.",2024-09-19

"@PanicFirst Value is what people are willing to pay for something.  While there is a short supply the prices will be higher.  Lowering rates should increase the supply.Not that the rates should have necessarily been lowered as much as they were, nevertheless, the supply should increase.",2024-09-19
@PanicFirst People thought housing prices in hot markets were 2x overvalued 10 years ago and then they doubled.Supply in markets with good jobs and schools is local and limited but demand is global.,2024-09-19
"@mike ekim Hey mike, I bought a couple of shares of MDT.  Not much else.  Today I don’t have any money, though tomorrow I probably will buy 10 shares of CP. On Monday, I may buy a share or two of AMT and JPM.",2024-09-19
Why would anyone own Z when they could own ZG $2.00 lower?????,2024-09-18
"@PanicFirst Rates, low ones, are what created ""overvalued"" in the first place. So rates matter. And as stated above, people are reluctant to sell with such low lock ins. Home prices haven't and likely won't correct as there is no distress situation so it's a matter of rates retreating. Homebuilders are buying down mtg. rates into the 5's for buyers. They've got a lot of margin in those overpriced units.",2024-09-18
Transitory:“Cheaper borrowing costs helped drive a 5.4% advance in the group’s home-purchase applications index to a three-month high. The refinancing gauge surged more than 24% to the highest level since April 2022.”www.bloomberg.com/...,2024-09-18
I think a big reason is that people realize the rates are going down and are putting off buying a home until the rates fall.,2024-09-18
Supply is the issue.  Until that changes prices will probably continue upwards.,2024-09-18
@PanicFirst Exactly. Seems like demand at these prices is exactly what you would expect,2024-09-18
"@Natturner1966 - the hope I was referring to was actual *earnings*. We've had strong real estate markets before and Zillow couldn't figure out how to cash in, right? Certainly ZG has momentum going for it ... but in my opinion the company has yet to prove it has figured out how to actually monetize its website. On a GAAP basis, the company still lost money last quarter:seekingalpha.com/...As pointed out in this piece, Zillow has been publicly traded for over a decade and still is not profitable on a GAAP basis. That is why I think ZG trading at $60 is - no offense - a joke and based on earnings ""hopium"".",2024-09-17
"@Michael Fitzsimmons You know, I’m not sure it’s up just on hopium. RDFN is up 126% in last 6 months. Investors are betting on a recovery in real estate in general I believe. This is why I bought ZG in the first place- to participate in the momentum. I believe this is what traders should do. Trade the momentum.",2024-09-17
"@Natturner1966 - congrats on your success! I obviously had a bad call on this one (although note my first SELL rating on Zillow was spot on). I still think this stock trades on ""hopium"".",2024-09-17
ZG - position closed (+39%) in: $43.40 out: $60.63. I still think it goes higher from here. Just locking in profits. I think I have captured most of the move. If it pulls back I might buy it back.,2024-09-17
Someone advised me to sell my Zillow position at $43. I most certainly did not.,2024-09-16
