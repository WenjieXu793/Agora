"I well written and balanced article. I’ve made my bet back a few years ago. I started buying MRVL aggressively in the low to mid $20s. I built a sizable full position and now utilize derivatives to drive my returns higher while I wait for the story to transpire. I do expect MRVL to materially expand revenues over the coming few years. I expect margins will expand as the model operating leverage takes hold. If their historical sectors come back in the next couple of years, the stock should move materially higher. I’m counting on it. Just my two cents. Slow and steady!  Good luck to all!",2024-10-06
"@Leonard Brecken I don't know that MRVL will hit 2.50 next year, but something in the 2.30-2.40 range is doable.   Nevertheless, your point is correct.  MRVL just needs a bit of time to ""grow into"" its earnings.  If it performs properly.",2024-10-06
Comps better next qrt so wont be long focus shifts to next fiscal yr and discover no longer that expensive on 2.50 in eps.....its a classic optics play as per article above demonstrates.,2024-10-05
"@tfizzle check out SMH or FSELX indexes. They’re both slightly different -check the holdings and %returns. FSELX has ON, and MRVL, but less volatility. NVDA is the largest holding in both.",2024-10-05
@Puche Cheers! AI-growth drivers should continue to boost its valuation higher over time!,2024-10-04
They also know how to manage reported earnings. Not saying good or bad. Just saying.,2024-10-04
Long and strong since the mid $20s and loving the ride. I like how the next 2-3 years are lining up. The two acquisitions over the past couple of years were well timed and set the company up well to participate in some advance products and services. Basically it moved MRVL up the food chain and should allow them to open up margins nicely over the coming years. Thanks for the article. All just my two cents. Slow and steady!  Good luck to all!,2024-10-04
"Lengthy consolidation phase.  Lengthy.  May last a few more quarters.  You have to be very patient with this name.  But I do think that if it breaks out, it will run a good solid 20% pretty quickly.",2024-10-04
Thanks for your analysis. I own a number of semiconductor related stocks with Marvel being one of my biggest positions.,2024-10-03
"@Yanakis Broadcom for sure, if you look at size, execution, margins, cashflows, leadership, ... everything. MRVL pretends they compete with AVGO on some markets (optics, switch...) but really it's like a little ant compared to the silverback gorilla on steroids hahaha",2024-10-03

"It seems marvell and broadcom are similar companies.  I don't know a lot about marvell, I do know that broadcom it's a very good company with excellent leadership. Not asking which is the better company, but in everyone's opinion which is the better stock performer?",2024-10-02

"@tfizzle ..........I was lucky and got MRVL in the $50 range.  Still hanging onto it, and I keep asking myself why?  It has been spinning its wheels for three years.  The dividend is almost nothing and they haven't raised it since they started giving one about 12 years ago.  They could afford to raise it as their payout ratio is very low.  I might sell it after the new year.",2024-10-02
"@A Retired Investor Same with ON Semi. Love the companies, stocks not treating me well.",2024-10-02
MRVL is a good stock to own if you liked riding a roller coaster for the last three years.,2024-10-01
"So all of Europe can't get a single combat helicopter into Ukraine but they can do this? Name *ONE* computer business based in Europe that makes an entire Machine plus software and sells to ... even themselves. Nokia is the only Company that comes to mind when talking ""computers"" and ""Europe."" What's left of Blackberry is another but still in Canada tho. Is this what is being talked about here?",2024-09-26
