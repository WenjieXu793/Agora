"@russwise Which to me is exactly the appeal of owning these shares. I do get the ambivalence some investors might have with a preferred yielding 7+% when they can put their money in a Schwab money market paying them 5+%, but if Powell and the Fed start to systematically take down rates in the same way they raised them, these shares will look a lot better when that Schwab account is paying 3+%.",2024-08-28
@RoHughes59 Yeah. I was gonna type the same thing. I agree. It’ll take years for the preferreds to recover.  I own all of them in equal amounts.  I’ll just keep clicking along collecting my 7%+ yield on each and keep them.,2024-08-27
Love the VNO.prO- ave cost 14.28 and original coupon is approximately 300 Basis points under water (yield 300 higher than 4.45 coupon ) Fed Funds 150 higher than 2 yr treasury so Powell has room to ease . This preferred is at 40% discount so $ price free to rise as funding costs drop - once these get to $25 or par further price gains slow as call features come into play - good hunting all,2024-08-27
"@kmetviner we will know by the end of the year who is correct. The company claims they have a lot of action at Penn 2. I also doubt they would have mentioned the master lease at 770 unless it was fairly certain to get done. They have plenty of cash and will be using the proceeds from the JV to pay down a corporate level debt coming due. I have no idea what corporate restructuring you are imagining. Also, if you wanted a good buying opportunity, you could have bought it at $12.",2024-08-27
"@Newton100 You are drinking the kool-aid re 2 Penn. Why did they bring on Cushman & Wakefield as leasing agent? Obviously, they know they need a lot of help. Re 770 Broadway, that is also a long shot. Liquidity is quickly becoming a bit of a challenge, and they are addressing it, to their credit. I still see a corporate restructuring as a way to generate cash. That would be a positive, but the market would likely sell off, thus providing a good buying opportunity.",2024-08-27
