@rjm22 It didnt crash in Jun15 2023 when they slashed div by 54%. I dont think that people expect much from this stock at these levels. Its an asset and FED rates play.,2024-09-14
@theblofeld For first half of 2024 they had over $100m FFO and over $300m unrestricted cash (almost $500m total). Dividend payments were only $15m.Doesnt seem like they were forced to stop dividend. Behler mentioned that they are looking at some opportunities on the market. That may be the reason.,2024-09-14
"Holy cow, what an absolute puff piece blowing sunshine and rainbows up investor's butts. Not a single hint the dividend was at risk.",2024-09-14
"Update:  ""PGRE announced that its board of directors suspended the Company’s regular quarterly dividend that would have otherwisebeen payable on October 15, 2024 noting that during 2024, the Company paid three regular quarterly dividendsaggregating $0.1050 per share of common stock, which approximates 100% of its estimated 2024 taxable income and“the decision by our Board of Directors to suspend our regular quarterly dividend aligns with our commitment to fortifyour balance sheet and maintain the utmost financial flexibility.”",2024-09-13
