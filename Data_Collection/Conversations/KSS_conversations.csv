"@ramgaana I would think so too.  Not that I want it to happen, but I would think it would be attractive for PE.  In 2022 their real estate was supposedly valued at $8B, and they only have about $1.5B of LT debt as of their last filing.  Even if you knock that $8B down some, the net liquidation value could easily be $5-6B vs a market cap of $2B.  As you said they keep generating more FCF as time goes on which provides even more options.",2024-09-26
"@Corgs42 I don't see how they don't get bought out, especially with rates coming down. Given the excess FCF the company generates and its invaluable real estate (which probably covers the net debt), KSS has got to be an attractive company for bidders. FRG did attempt to buy them for 53/sh in 2022 - when rates were about to rocket, inflation was mooing. Now rates are on a sharp down cycle, inflation is under control. So if KSS was attractive in 2022, it ought to be much more attractive now. No?",2024-09-26
@ramgaana Agreed with everything you said.  It’s trading far below its liquidation value so that really boosts the risk vs reward as well.,2024-09-26
"Arguably one of the best risk/reward set ups in the whole market -1) Lowest no. of shares outstanding since 2010 2) Highest number of shares shorted since 20103) Lowest valuation since 20104) Highest dividend yield since 20105) Highest cost for shorts (dividend + borrow rate) to remain short since 2010Have built a fairly decent position since mid 19s. Curious to see how this plays out. Despite the bad narrative around dept stores since pre covid, the facts above seem to be beyond irrational. This company is nowhere near the risk of bankruptcy. Should I die on the KSS hill, my last words shall echo that of Oscar Wilde - ""Either the wallpaper goes or I do""",2024-09-21
"@Tschurin You are correct. I was looking at year-end numbers for fiscal years vs. August quarter. 12-month change (YoY) is a $310 million drop in seasonal inventory level. CAPEX was about $270 million less than depreciation, plus $280 million income level gets you close to $700-$800 million in extra cash flow. If KSS went out of business, liquidated its inventory at a discount, then sold its real estate, you are likely getting back considerably more than $20 per share after paying off all liabilities.",2024-09-17
"@Paul Franke Inventory for a retailer typically refers to merchandise inventory, and that is how Kohl's itself thinks of it. This from their latest earnings call: ""Inventory at quarter-end was down 9% compared to last year, once again exceeding our commitment of mid-single-digits decline."" And in their May earnings call they specifically cited inventory management as the primary force behind operating cash flow improvement. I defer to you on the accounting treatment for real estate as I have not looked into that yet.",2024-09-17
"@Tschurin Inventories have actually increased. KSS can keep up to $750 million annually as depreciation/amortization expense on its vast real estate holdings, plus equipment write-downs.",2024-09-17
"@Paul Franke An interesting presentation. I might have been more convinced if you had discovered and analyzed the rationale of the shorts, i.e., what aspects of Kohls led them to short the stock. While free cash flow is a key metric to focus on, it’s also important to analyze the source of the FCF. In Kohl’s case it’s almost certain that inventory reduction has recently been an important source of that FCF, and it’s likely that there may not be that much more inventory reduction available as a source for FCF. Also concerning is KSS's lack of overall revenue growth; despite the addition of Sephora. While you say a recession is the primary worry, I am more worried about the “woke” controversy that Kohl’s became embroiled with; a lot of Kohl’s anti-woke customers may have said goodbye to the store and won't return. What do you think? Despite those caveats you may well be right that KSS is a promising trade, to hold until a short-squeeze, another activist investor, a buyout bid, improved performance or any combination thereof.",2024-09-17
"@Paul Franke I did a little bit more DD, now own 2400 shares at $19.03Will sit back and now watch",2024-09-16
"@Paul Franke Thank you for the article. I have put KSS on my watch list. Looking at the financials, I think the current $2 dividend is safe, unless like you state there is a major recession. Interesting story",2024-09-16
"Simply superb analysis Paul - thank you for your deep dive on Kohls.  I follow this company very closely, which isn't too hard given that I live in Wisconsin and am situated less than 15 miles from their corporate headquarters in Menomonee Falls, WI; they are simply a steady-eddy in their approach to business, stores always have a steady stream of customers, and they continue to try to innovate where possible, including Babies-R-Us now being gradually rolled out to the stores.  As mentioned, the free cash flow is strong and can relatively easily support the now 10% dividend.  I own the stock outright to collect the dividend, and also have some out-of-the-money put option plays on it as well.  A deep recession is a concern for all retailers, including Kohls, but even with that scenario, my gut tells me Kohls will be a survivor.  Cheers!",2024-09-16
"@southbuckeye GAAP earnings is not what the divi is coming from- it's paid out of FCF, which is 3x the divi. No chance for a cut.",2024-09-16
"@Tao Jaxx Without the overly aggressive short interest, KSS would be a $30 stock. If we get a soft landing and earnings beats next year WHILE shorts cover, KSS is back to $35-40 price range.",2024-09-15
Weird situation: apparently the shorts enjoy paying a 10% dividend...,2024-09-15
"Thanks for pointing out the short position.Seems like as long as the business sort of muddles through and maintains FCF similar to what it is doing now, the biggest thing affecting the price will be the short position.  Not much more downside at this level, but there is potential upside even if the ratios just revert to the mean values.I have to say however, I am no longer very impressed with Kohls as a retailer. Before I retired, I used to shop there quite often. Last couple of times I have been in there I haven't bought anything - seems mostly oriented to younger women and mostly store brands.",2024-09-13
"@Paul Franke Or once they get the debt down they could buy stock, it is a better use of money than raising the dividend, and it would also panic the shorts",2024-09-13
"@Paul Franke but you know they wouldn't do that. Dividend cut quite possible. Dividend raise to $3, when earning $2, a thousand to one shot.",2024-09-13
@southbuckeye $700 million FCF vs. $221 million dividend payout last 12 months. KSS could raise the dividend to $3 to start the short squeeze if they wanted.,2024-09-13
A little premature to think that a short squeeze is possible at this time.Until there are more shares short or a possible catalyst it's a little early to be talking about short squeeze material.,2024-09-13
"The author lists the projected earnings of KSS for the next three years. In the first year, the dividend exceeds the earnings. In year two and three, the earnings barely exceed the dividend. KSS needs to invest in its stores. Don't count on the dividend not being cut in half.",2024-09-13
