"""In the Spring and Summer of 2023, Yellow was working to implement Phase 2 of a One Yellow initiative that would have provided hundreds of millions of dollars in additional income annually, enabled new financing, and put Yellow on the path to long-term sustainability. At the same time, Yellow had retained a financial advisor and was “in the market” for financing to bridge to a final labor deal, similar to the deals Yellow had reached with its Unions repeatedly over the prior 15 years. Yellow had no reason to believe that, in July 2023, the IBT would kill the Company (and cause the loss of 22,000 of its own members’ jobs), leaving it to liquidate. Any suggestion that Yellow was legally required to issue WARN notices to its workforce two months before the IBT blindsided the Company with a strike notice in late-July 2023—causing Yellow’s customers to flee and destroying Yellow’s prospects of obtaining financing—is absurd. No responsible company would have done so, and issuing WARN notices prior to the fallout from the IBT’s ill-fated strike notice would have been a breach of Yellow’s duty to other stakeholders. Yellow’s plans failed only because of the IBT’s unforeseeable, irrational decision to destroy Yellow in late July 2023 by refusing to engage in the same give and take of normal collective bargaining Yellow and the IBT had engaged in for decades and, instead, threatening to strike in a highly public way.""Fact.",2024-10-03
@Kirk Spano In order to get back to better there may be some resistance but that bit of resistance is far better for the future than the destruction we are seeing now.,2024-10-02

"@golfcat1 we ought to control the border, but, we ought to be issuing enough work visas and green cards to offset Boomer retirements. That requires millions of immigrants per year.",2024-10-01
@santlo It won't. Markets will tank if the weird guys take over. They are a threat to democracy and capitalism.,2024-09-30
"@erbrown Don’t bet the farm on that. I don’t see cap gain tax on unrealized gains. For openers, evaluations are impossible, not only for the likes of farm land but also for 1000 shares of a publicly-traded stock, liquidity is a big deal. Then there’s the velue of the local family business. Not so fast.",2024-09-29

"FreightWaves:""A motion from the Teamsters union to block Yellow Corp.’s deposition of union head Sean O’Brien was denied in a federal bankruptcy court in Delaware on Tuesday. The union was seeking a stay to provide it more time to challenge the deposition ruling in a U.S. district court. The bankruptcy court did grant a seven-day administrative stay on Tuesday, leaving the Teamsters one week to see if the district court will grant a stay while it considers taking up the appeal.The bankruptcy court ruled earlier this month that O’Brien could be deposed by Yellow regarding up to $244 million in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act claims against the estate. Yellow claims correspondence between CEO Darren Hawkins and O’Brien are key to its “good faith” defense, relieving the company of its duty to provide timely layoff notices to employees ahead of its July 2023 shutdown.“Indeed, given the extremely modest commitment required by the Court’s Order, it appears Mr. O’Brien simply does not want to be questioned, under oath, as to his role in the loss of approximately 22,000 IBT [International Brotherhood of Teamsters] member jobs,” a Friday court filing from Yellow attempting to block the stay read. “But Mr. O’Brien’s role is directly related to the WARN claims filed by the IBT and several Debtor defenses thereto, and Mr. O’Brien does not get to avoid a deposition merely because he would personally prefer not to talk about these subjects under oath.”",2024-09-25
@slodon28 of course it will - just ask Milton Friedman. Spending leads to inflation (Why I sold any bond holding/ blended fund before 2022). Don't make this so hard.,2024-09-16
@TJ Burke Wont all of that NEW that government spending increase inflation?,2024-09-16
Spending will take off again under Harris. All her initiatives require new spending. It's objective reality and your lack of policy awareness or shallow partisanship does not change it.,2024-09-15
"@King Ice finance.yahoo.com/...""The implication is that Yellow is now responsible for some form of withdrawal liability to 11 different MEPPs that received government funds.""Seems that the liability is somewhere between $1B and $6.5B, curious how does this now factor into your recovery estimates? The plan has got to be more than overfunded now, they should just annuitize those plans",2024-09-15

"@Brucejfern Having owned $MAIN, $ARCC, $OBDC, etc., in the past, I now think $PBDC or $BIZD (the ETFs with nice dividends) is the best way to participate in this sector. Spread the risk.
