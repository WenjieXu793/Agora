"@translate there are nuggets of truth in your ramblings, but you miss some things. People always want to try “fiber” but they aren’t better, and in many cases are worse given they don’t offer mobile and what they will find is the same thing as cable…price increases down the road and the same dissatisfaction. What is driving the share price being depressed is uncertainty in what the business will be. Will it be a race to the bottom, or will it be a FCF machine with limited capex ? The answer right now isn’t certain.",2024-09-29
"@Nichalyssa yes, as a former holder i am aware of all these things, and even experienced charters' disastrous upsell strategies.here are other things i know :- all the indexes are at highs while liberty is 60% off its own.- subscriber losses continue, even to overbuilders.in a hated industry, its the incumbent that loses out and never recovers NPS.  hell, people even switch to give comcast a try if they have charter, and vice-versa.- malone has overpaid his management friends for decades , and now aware of his own mortality, is trying to clean up many ventures.  most unlikely to reclaim peaks.these are broadband companies, and haven't been valued as a dying cable biz since cord-cutting and debundling  started.",2024-09-26
"@translate do you know what their market cap is, how many shares outstanding, normalized fcf? Do you know that 60% of their footprint is a monopoly for speeds above 100 mbps? Do you know that they have the low cost position in broadband and how fast their mobile business is growing? Do you know how much their footprint grows every year? Do you know they can offer a mobile/wifi/broadband bundle across their whole footprint that telcos cannot replicate? Do you know how low their pricing is for that bundle and how much profit the telcos stand to lose if they aggressively compete on price? Unhappy customers and cable has been going on for 60 years. And the biggest reason customers are angry was pricing for the cable channel bundles which cable didn’t have much control over. I can’t stand any cable, telco, mobile business I have ever dealt with yet I pay them 250 dollars a month for 2 people including a few streaming channels. And cable gets a small % of that total spend. Are you from earth?",2024-09-26
"in the end, this is a loser if you hold on to charter shares, and no amount of docsis tech is going to help.since covid price gouging and relentless up-selling, it is ~3 years now with no strategy to retain existing (very unhappy) customers, who then they spend tons on marketing to recover.  inertia that had kept them around now works against charter.",2024-09-25
@bluescorpion0 So you believe that the determining variable of a business intrinsic value is the market price falling?  Is it not possible for Charter to be deeply undervalued and still have its stock drop?,2024-09-24
"@alcw charter didnt fleece twc, there was a competing offer from Altice which forced liberty to pay much more than they had talked about a year earlier before comcast tried to steal twc.  And now the values of cable stock are probably lower than the multiple that charter paid for twc.",2024-09-24
"Charter fleeced the TWC peeps, let's see if they can do it again here.  I like the footprint add here...now the big question in any ""merger""...who is retiring, who gets forced out and who really runs the show?  Is it the old cablevision crew or will Malone force them to hold onto his team in key leadership roles for a few years.",2024-09-24
Solid article.  I’ve been long LBRDK and waiting for this to happen.  Nice to get the underlying (Charter shares) at such a big discount.,2024-09-24
"And the main issue with SIRI was its tiny liquidity, which is not the case with CHTR.",2024-09-24
@bluescorpion0 Siri likely was overvalued/ however Siri is a different company so its relevance is zero,2024-09-24
And if charter is overvalued as was Siri before the merger it will drop ..Siri is now 2.5 bucks pre split. And was down from like 5 when the merger announced.,2024-09-24
"@rgpeterson4592 yes I am long $LBRDP as well w a basis near $22, happily long for as 'long' as it is outstanding thru all this merger nonsense, Malone the master manipulator but the value is here. Shares go xd this week, 1.75/yr is fine w me given the huge backing in value of Charter stock.  4% total allocation w most in my RothIRA w no tax issues.  At current share price 24.62 it is still a great value and should trade well over that especially if rates keep falling. Bea",2024-09-24
@yazzer yes I can see that just on protected yield if rates keep falling,2024-09-24
"@Early Retiree That's right. The NAV in that scenario would be $102.79 per share and the ratio would be 0.315. Since LBC already counter-offered 0.29, that's the max we can expect. I hope that ends up being the ratio. One more interesting detail is that in the counter-offer they are trying to  or reduce (or eliminate maybe) the need for LBC to participate on CHTR's buybacks. Given the current discount today (18.8% aprox) its much better to keep the shares and not participate in the buyback at all.",2024-09-24
"@Luis Hernandez Correct. So GCI all in should be worth $3.6B EV to cancel out net debt at LBRD, and the multiple implied by my thesis would be 10x EBITDA.",2024-09-24
@Early Retiree GCI's EBITDA'23 was $361M. At 6.81x that's an EV $2.458 billion. Net debt at GCI of $1.084 billion. Equity value ff GCI is $1.374 billion. LBC's net debt $2.569 billion. They don't quite neutralize each other. Then there's the $180M of preferred stock.,2024-09-24
"@Luis Hernandez Thank you. I don't understand the math here. GCI makes $350m of adj. EBITDA. In my calculation I am considering that GCI's EV is roughly equal to all net debt at LBRD, which would be $2.6B or 7.42x EBITDA. What am I missing?",2024-09-24
"Nice write-up as always. I do have a question on the 0.275 ratio. For that to work, GCI's multiple is 4.85x EBITDA. That's WAY TOO LOW. The 0.29 ratio proposed by LBC makes more sense, and it is still quite cheap (6.81x EBITDA). The LBC net debt ex-GCI's is $2.569 billion. GCI's net debt is $1.084 billion.The amount of CHTR shares currently owned by LBC is 45,571,206.With yesterday's closing price on CHTR at $331.60, NAV is $96.16 per share.",2024-09-24
I bought LBRDP about a year ago for the +7% dividend and the 2039 Call Date feeling it could be a sort-of cornerstone for my long-term investment account.Assuming the merger with Charter goes through I think it sweetens my position going forward.,2024-09-24
@bluescorpion0 I did some work on the merger and my analysis can be found here:seekingalpha.com/...,2024-09-24
