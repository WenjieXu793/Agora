"@techy46 Sounds like something a poor person would say, which begs the question why are you even on an investing site to begin with.  Cash has zero risk and earns over 5% which better than most stocks, any one whose not a fool would know that.",2024-09-24

Why does CFPB have any say in bank regulations?CFPB is just another US agency with quasi legal overreach.,2024-09-23
"@Mike2021 Disagree,  FDIC was not formed to protect corp payroll accounts.Indiviudals w/ $250K+ in any single bank account are fools.",2024-09-23
"FDIC needs to raise savings limits to $500k or a $1m, it was raised to $250k during 2008, due to massive inflation it should be raised again.",2024-09-20
It does seem as if this last proposal was written by the NY Fed. Doesn't look so good on Main Street.,2024-09-20
"Makes sense ... less capital = more odds of failure = more odds of FDIC payouts and capital raises. Of course FDIC would be peeved. Of course, the original Fed proposal was going to immediately put a whole bunch of banks underwater, illustrating just how fragile things are, so they couldn't do it.Stay far away from banking sector. Business risk is high and LT returns on bank stocks are uncompetitive anyway.My two cents. Make if it what you will :)",2024-09-20
Yeah..whata shame the Fed didn't work with Lehman Bros. in 2008....just saying...,2024-09-20
"Good Article! In the past, I have been stymied trying to become comfortable with State Street as an investment.  Thanks for cutting to the chase, I find their Annual Report a challenging read.",2024-09-19
"@2021investor Lower Mortgage rates will lead to refinancing at lower rates, devaluing mortgages via higher CPR, and leading to lower interest components. If you think service fees will salvage the lost value, then go ahead. The only thing going for banks in a declining-rate environment is 1) IBD, and 2) Lower funding cost + higher credit spread on loan book, but credit event risk is usually higher when rates first start dropping, so, that's why you're seeing banks reduce duration on loans (lower returns), I use $MS as an example.",2024-09-13
"@Pearl Gray Equity and Research Why not? Nobody's taking out mortgages right now. With lower rates, the floodgates will open again.",2024-09-12
"@MileHighMoney30 It's both. ""The market"" is a lot of different people doing different things. Sometimes the things they do has a common theme. However, news articles talk about ""the market"" as if it's one individual. Trying to understand the psychology of ""the market"" is like trying to understand what direction an army of ants will scatter. Depending on the environment, incentives, and stimulus, it can be all sorts of things.Some people are expecting 25bps, others are expecting 50bps, some changed their minds given X or Y news. On balance, the net change is reflected in the market. Zoomed out, it looks ""random"" to a series of economists and other academics. When it finally happens next week, the immediate result will be corrected towards what actually happens. But the overall long-term result ""should"" be that the economy improves with rate cuts, depending on how severe the economy was damaged with the rate hikes.That's my take at least from a random guy on the internet.",2024-09-11
@MileHighMoney30 Rate cuts are good for banks looking to grow their loan books.,2024-09-11
"Im confused, I thought a larger rate cut meant the economy was struggling more than we would like but now a smaller rate cut is bad? Which is it?!",2024-09-11
This is the start of possibly a very dramatic easing cycle so hardly bad news for Banks as credit becomes more widely available and as there be no shortage of Government need to borrow let alone all of the massive industries currently running flat out to meet demand and still hardly immaterial inflation even Banks should make money here.

Banks were down previously because a 50 bsp cut was on the table. Letâ€™s pick whatever nonsense headline fits our narrative today. NII is the story this week with JPM cooling expectations. This has overshadowed banks who made positive remarks and reaffirmed guidance. Place your bets accordingly.,2024-09-11
