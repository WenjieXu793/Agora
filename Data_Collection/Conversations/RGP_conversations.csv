"When it comes to the 6% dividend:- Operating cash flow will be at least $22 million in FY 2025 and the foreseeable future, based on the company's latest reports and growth initiatives.- Annual CapEx has always been minimal and less than $3 million over the last years, according to the annual cash flow reports. Given that CapEx in Q1 FY 2025 was only $266K, CapEx in FY 2025 will remain below $3 million for another year in a row. - As a result, annual free cash flow will be at least $19 million in the foreseeable future.- Annual dividend payment is approximately $19 million, based on $0.56 per share annual dividend.- Therefore, the annual free cash flow will fully cover the annual dividend payment in the foreseeable future.- On top of this, RGP's cash & cash equivalents are $90 million at the end of Q1 FY 2025, which is a significant cash cushion that can support the annual dividend payment for several years, if needed.",2024-10-03

"@JPS Capital It is Palm Valley Capital....ticker PVCMX.   They mentioned RGP in their 2Q 2024 Quarterly Commentary.  Here is what the portfolio managers wrote:""We purchased one new position during the second quarter. Resources Connection (ticker: RGP) is a global consulting firm focused on project execution. The company’s 4,100 professionals specialize in facilitating initiatives associated with business transformation, strategic transactions, or regulatory change. Many employees have Big Four or legal backgrounds. In the mid 2000’s RGP was viewed as the best public company play on Sarbanes Oxley compliance requirements, leading to a temporary profit boom. Besides consulting projects, the company also competes on the high end of professional staffing. RGP works with over 2,000 clients, including 87% of the Fortune 100.Factoring in RGP’s extremely clean balance sheet, the business has never been priced this low since its IPO over 20 years ago. While results have been on a consistent downward slide for almost two years, the performance is consistent with other providers of consulting and temporary staffing. The stock’s valuation multiples are appealing on both a trailing and normalized basis, although RGP’s financials have not yet bottomed. RGP has generated positive free cash flow every year since going public. We believe it will survive the current industry recession.""",2024-09-25
@Rob G. in Vegas Thanks. I plan on revisiting this stock as well in light of the underperformance. Looks historically cheap to TBV. Which small cap manager are you referring to?,2024-09-24
"Thanks for the concise article. Is it fair to judge the company's return on equity on 'average invested capital' when so much of the balance sheet is tied up in 'goodwill' and 'intangible assets'? Presumably, ROTE is a more accurate measure.",2024-09-24
