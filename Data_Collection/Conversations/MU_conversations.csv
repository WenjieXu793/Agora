"@Outcast_Searcher Thanks for your comments. Appreciate your time and attention very much. ""One should obviously know what one is doing (from books, articles, multiple sources, etc) BEFORE trading stock options."" - I am working on this. I did my first covered call last week although I have been buying stocks since 2007 (but never spent much time on investing). Retired a few months ago and spending more time learning now. I started following you on Seeking Alpha so I can copy you and become a better investor. Thank you again sir. -Kris",2024-10-06
"@ndardick ""I rely upon my aggressive trading in stock options to drive my out-performance compared to the S&P 500 Index that is my benchmark."" - I need to study and figure this out. Thank you for mentioning it.",2024-10-06
"@desperados76 ASML is a great company that has a wide competitive moat with a monopoly in EUV. I don't own the stock because one of my ""lessons-learned"" over the years is to avoid owning foreign firms. Regarding CDNS and SNPS, I do not follow companies in that sub-sector, so I don't have an opinion of them.",2024-10-06
"@SuperPac:  Presuming Powell / the Fed continues to be DATA based (AKA rational) about their moves, that's the best we can have. For example, ongoing evidence we aren't entering a recession (if the recent jobs data is a valid indication) should preclude ""too many"" rate cuts. I believe the experts at the Fed are MUCH more competent to make such decisions than a bazillion armchair pundits and political hacks that infest the internet with their emotional policy opinions, but few facts and VERY little actual math and economics.  That's why I never say ""the Fed should do X short term"".  Having lived through the inflation storm of the late 60's through early 80's, preventing anything close to THAT is job one by a country mile for the fed, IMO.",2024-10-06
"@Celandina:  Short to intermediate term, we NEVER have any idea about the market, despite all the belief in systems and arts and charts.  Long term, I have faith that (barring a total system shattering event that we can't predict anyway) something like the SPY or QQQ will be MUCH MUCH higher.  But the vast majority of people don't want to wait the 4 decades to be almost certain, or even the 2 decades to make that HIGHLY probable.",2024-10-06
"@Outcast_Searcher You are preaching to the choir here. If you followed my prolific comments on SA, you would know that I rely upon my aggressive trading in stock options to drive my out-performance compared to the S&P 500 Index that is my benchmark. In fact, I have been actively trading options for more than five decades....yes, even before they were publicly traded in the early 1970s.",2024-10-06
"@K SA 01:  Respectfully, just to be clear -- such short term trading strategies are SPECULATION.  Investing is over a multi-year horizon. I do both (more investing than speculation).  Nothing wrong with doing both, but not knowing the difference may WELL be subjecting your holdings to far more risk than you're ready for, especially in a relatively expensive market rife with speculation.  (For example, if you're fully invested at 94, what's your plan if the QQQ drops in half over the next 3 years?  Just hold it and hope?   I'd rather sell some option spreads for income and not get a full position until a MUCH lower price.  And yes, I realize I might well be leaving plenty of money on the table.  So might you if the stock DOES rise 50 or 100 percent over the next several years.Also, if the market overall DOES rise a lot, then my large portfolio percentage of core holdings (never sold, just reinvesting dividends and any cap. gain distributions for over 30 years) in various index funds and ETFs is VERY happy about that.  (The tax efficiency of doing that in things like an efficient broad based Vanguard fund which only pays a small dividend can't be overstated.  If you don't sell, it's almost as good as a 401-K, but without all the restrictions or penalties if you do decide to sell some).",2024-10-06
@FearGreedy:  Why would wanting to wait for a less risky PE mean he expects bankruptcy -- in any way?,2024-10-06
"@Cepages:  I do that with a variety of good stocks (general idea, collecting both short term covered call and some put theta, but only around the EDGES of a position, unless the stock moves significantly over time.  Then I let them either sell me more at an increasingly great price over time, or sell some for larger and larger profits over time. As long as I REALLY like the stock for the long term, this has worked well for me. The key thing, IMO, is NOT to get greedy and acquire a ""huge"" position in any one stock.  Too risky, and too easy to let emotions get involved, leading to weak decision making. Are you selling ""all the options you safely can"" to maximize premium income / theta decay, or are you doing more of a partial position to get paid while you wait?  (I LOVE being paid to wait, overall).",2024-10-06
@DTRPDX:  Short term FOMO chasing is NOT long term investment.,2024-10-06
"@kalu0003:  That's an interesting take.  Respectfully, I think long run, solid high performing semiconductor chips and memory will grow well, whether the current ""AI"" speculation ends up being a big deal or a ripple, so I see it as LESS risk than, say, taking a big stake in NVDA -- while acknowledging that if ""AI"" makes it big in the next decade, NVDA has a higher return potential. To me, one of the biggest values in sites like SA is being able to see and exchange ideas in the comments with other investors.  As random as people and their beliefs can be, a mix of ideas is almost always better than just one's own, re a complex future.  ""The Wisdom of Crowds"" idea (re Suroweicki's book) seems ample proof of that, IMO.",2024-10-06
"Despite strong earnings, my only problem with the stock is that it doesn't have much independence from $NVDA, i.e., it trades closely to $NVDA but consistently underperforms it on days that $NVDA is up. It seems that $MU may not get the multiple it deserve but rather will continue to be a commodity semiconductor play.",2024-10-06
"The article thesis is sound, but I guess we have to wait Q3 DRAM market share. Does anyone here know the EXACT expected eps growth and fwd p/e of both SK Hynix and Samsung's? I guess it would be difficult to use Samsung as a comparison, given the company has multiple business lines",2024-10-06
"@tar19 Is it a sample of the sector, or a symbol of the stock and what is to come. I am in the camp that it is the sector, based off of the earnings and rapid growth of HBM for at least the next 2 years. Then add in all of the other high value products that will be joining the sales party.",2024-10-06
