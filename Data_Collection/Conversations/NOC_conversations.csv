@MySami it will be greatly reduced if Pooh decides to invade Taiwan. I think Putins disaster in Ukraine is giving him second thoughts.,2024-10-05
@123semi It's not in Putin's interest for him to unilaterally pull out of the Ukraine at this time..The West will have to offer Putin a plausible off ramp dealthat will allow Putin a reason to quit fighting.Putin has control of approx 20% of the Ukraine land mass.Most of it he has controlled since 2014.  Perhaps the best time to have seriously negotiated with Putin would have been 8 years ago...? As it stands now its absolutely fantasy to think Putin willexit the whole of Ukraine without Zelensky giving up someterritory to get a deal done.,2024-10-05

"@MySami really. Russia is already facing massive labor shortages amd inflation because of the lack of working age men. Drafted, fled the country or dead. You need to study Russian demographics. They are in big trouble.",2024-10-04

"Agreed 100% on NOC also being a tech company. In fact, all defense stocks are tbh. I like NOC’s continued development of drone tech, such as their manta ray sea drones.",2024-10-04
"@Leo Nelissen Your evolving macro perspective keeps me on my toes, Leo, and makes me a better investor.I hope you are as diligent in your 3-day-a-week exercise regimen as you are in bringing new ideas to us on a daily basis.Speaking of humbling, two weeks ago I sustained a severe hamstring injury that prevented me from playing tennis every day. Until yesterday. I was advised by my medical professionals that I should rest for six weeks. But I started to have compensating injuries in my other leg and my back, and needed to treat  my ostensibly debilitating injury in the context of my overall mental and physical well being. And move forward. So I worked out in a swimming pool, taped up my hamstring, and played with a pro yesterday. Two weeks is close to six weeks, right? I feel fine now, and am going to a tennis drill this morning.My point, I think, is that you need to move forward or you are really moving backward. This is equally true for our portfolios as well as our bodies. That's why I am so diligent, and active, in managing our portfolios in the context of an evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop.Another equally compelling point here is that you can and should seek advice from professionals, and listen to them, but ultimately it is your responsibility to do what is most appropriate for your particular situation and needs. This applies to our bodies as well as our portfolios.You are good at helping the rest of us treat our portfolios in a similar manner as our bodies. Strengthening our portfolios, and preparing for the future.When I managed portfolios for insurance companies, I wrote a weekly financial newsletter in which I compared the markets to pop culture events and closed every newsletter with my tag line: ""Hug your loved ones often, floss your teeth daily, and always smile when you trade.""Mind, body and spirit!",2024-10-04
"I somehow missed this article yesterday. Glad I found it this morning. I discovered a lot from the details displayed.I agree that NOC is not cheap, which is why I sold it. However, you make a good point that it is a tech stock in hiding. So this weekend I will take another look at NOC in this context. It's time to update my analysis of all of the aerospace/defense contractors anyway.",2024-10-04
"Leo, thanks for going deep on NOC.A few things you quipped:'Since 2014, the company has grown its dividend by 12% per year.''Northrop isn't very cheap.''would be a gradual buyer.'Personally, been buying monthly since 2014, so, got that right.  (Love dividend growth more than dividend size.  Best spot on the curve.)  NOC is rarely cheap, hence the solution is to buy monthly.  'Gradual buyer' is perfect for stocks that seem to be perpetually elevated.Very good review (as usual).  NOC is not my largest defense holding, but it is the one getting new money, so, obviously agree w/the rating.  Thanks once more.Alex.",2024-10-03

@HardytheTrader I had to roll out calls on LMT a little further as I was in danger of shares I have owned for a decade and a half being called away.,2024-10-02
"''Yes, the way mankind is going, best to be overweight Cyber tech, and F-35s/Missiles.''Yep, there are some very bad people in positions of concentrated power who are funding endless wars and arming others nations / groups to fight. They are skilled in packaging and cloaking their fiendish intentions for war in beguiling language for mass consumption. Utterly slippery slope.",2024-10-02

"@HardytheTrader Have held LMT, GD, NOC, RTX for years, nearly a decade. These are great long term stocks, assets for all seasons. Intrinsically, a carve out from the federal pie goes to them and then to the shareholders as dividends / buy-backs and stock price growth. Never selling.",2024-10-01
