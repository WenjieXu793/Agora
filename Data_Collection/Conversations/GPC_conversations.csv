"@sa6abe Hi and thanks for the question. I respect the fact that you're open to learning. I had ""ancora imparo"" written above my desk when I worked on Bay Street, and we may be kindred spirits in that way. Given that, what I'm about to write about is my approach, and I think you should not consider it to be the end all and be all of this stuff. Question it, take what's useful from it, add other stuff to it to make your own approach. Here's mine:Although I'm as much of a fan of accrual accounting as any semi-sane person can be, when it comes to debt, I'm all about cash. So, when you look at the contractual obligations section of the latest 10-K, you see (pp. 29) that they've got ~$1.4 billion coming due over a relatively short period of time. I put that number in context by comparing it to the delta between CFO and CFI. Over the past 3 years, they've generated an average of $1.386 billion CFO. Over the same time period, they've needed to invest an average of $965 million CFI in the business.Consider also that the CFO figure above includes ~$989 million of depreciation that was added back to CFO because stuff wearing out is a non-cash item. Thing is, stuff DOES wears out, and so I think it's bu11$hit that such things are added back, thus inflating CFO.Taking all of the above into consideration, I think the $1.4 billion over the 1-3 year time frame is a bit of a spicy meatball. This is especially the case in light of the fact that cash has basically been cut in half over the past 6 months (down $546 million), while LT debt is down only about $25.5 million.I hope the above makes sense. I truly appreciate questions that seem to come from an honest desire to understand. Too many ""questions"" on this forum are barely disguised barbs, and so many thanks.

"@Patrick Doyle Hi, thanks for the reply! I agree with everything you said, I don't find GPC a good opportunity at the moment in term of expected returns vs risks too, exactly. I was just, and still am, really curoius why did you say the debt is excessive, maybe to learn a new perspective to look at debt levels. The debt is about $5B, they are sitting on $1B in cash and the CFO/FCF has been about $1B in the last years. So is that excessive? With a dividend payout ratio of around 50% they can really pay down their debt significantly if they needed/wanted to...Would love to read how you are looking at it.",2024-09-27
"@sa6abe Hi and thanks for the comment. A few things in response.1) In my view, anchoring on/comparing this company to others that ""you've seen lately"" isn't relevant in my view. I think excessive debt is a widespread problem, so you might make a good faith claim that this is one of the cleanest dirty shirts, but that's not compelling in my view. For instance, the rollover risk at the moment is terrible, given the heretofore cheap debt that's coming due next year.2) It's all about relative risk. If a Treasury Note gets you X, and this thing gets you some fraction of X, you're being paid a negative risk premium at current prices. Willingly receiving less for more risk...that just kind of sounds dumb to me, manageable debt or not. I don't know why people don't benchmark stocks against Treasuries (CNBC-itis?), but they should. Anyway, thanks for the comment and take care.PD",2024-09-26
How is the debt exessive? One of the more managable debts I've seen lately,2024-09-24
"@Hugh Arhue Yep. It's nearly 40% of net sales and tends to compound at a faster clip. Recent quarters have been the exception, but I suspect that should change soon as the segment bounces back.",2024-09-11
@usiah GPC at $84.20 is an original component of my IRA.,2024-09-11
@usiah Congrats on the long term buy and hold and thanks for sharing.,2024-09-11
GPC -- one of my longest-held stocks. So long ago that I don't recall offhand when I initially bought it.Retired dividend-growth investor,2024-09-11
"@Slow roller While CB has been a great long-term hold and remains one of our top five holdings, I would not buy it at its current price.I do not own any ETFs because I don't want to buy the mutts with the best of breed, and both tend to be in diversified ETFs. The only ETF that I endorse, because of the nature of its structure, is QQQ. Thank you for your compliment.",2024-09-11
"@Kody's Dividends I agree with @ndardick that your plan to live off dividends (combined with other government retiree benefits) in retirement is a good one Kody. I'm retired and target a 3% to 3.5% overall portfolio div yield to allow me to do so. That way I only have to sell a holding if I see a better opportunity elsewhere.FWIW, Morningstar gives GPC a 3 star rating (with a fair value of $148) and assigns it a narrow economic moat. By extrapolation it looks like their 4 star price is around $125. Thanks for bringing this idea up. I'll add it to my watch list.",2024-09-11
"@ndardick quick question… I know you have CB …. Would you buy it at today’s level? Also, do you have any ETF’s ? Always enjoy reading your comments… thanks",2024-09-11
@ndardick I’d think GPC would be pretty recession proof as more pro fix their own cars.,2024-09-11
"You picked a winner there Kody.  Everyone knows ""NAPA Know How"" but not everyone is keen to the acquisition years ago of Motion Industries: The Industrial Parts Group is represented by Motion Industries in North America and Mi Asia Pac in Australasia. The Industrial Parts Group provides access to more than 19 million industrial replacement parts and supplies for more than 200,000 MRO (maintenance, repair and operations) and OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customers in all types of end markets. We track 14 different end markets which includes: equipment and machinery, food and beverage, iron and steel, pulp and paper, mining and automotive, among others.   . . ,  which BTW last time I checked its revenues were growing faster than the Auto Parts Biz. (If you could check I think it's over 40% of Revenue and growing faster) The biggest boost is all the Warehousing retrofitting and anything / everything associated with movement of products/packages.",2024-09-11
"Yes, Kody. Your plan to live off of dividends is a good one. And GPC is a legitimate investment candidate, although I don't see sufficient upside from its current price to buy it now. Stocks such as this one tend to decline materially in a recession, so the next recession (are we in it yet?) should give you a better entry price.Your focus on dividend paying stocks is in sync with the views expressed by Leo Nelissen in an article entitled ""Why everyone should be a dividend investor"" that was published on SA this morning:seekingalpha.com/...",2024-09-11
"I think I’m more concerned about growth prospects than you are. The electrification of our automotive fleet over time will significantly diminish two of the big maintenance areas for cars: oil changes and brakes. Yes, EV’s still have brakes but they work very differently and don’t need to be changed nearly as often. This headwind is definitely a bit down the road, but it’s something to keep in mind.",2024-09-11
@Hubert Biagi Hope Boeing can survive without parts made in China. This could even threaten the CEO annual bonus.,2024-09-11
