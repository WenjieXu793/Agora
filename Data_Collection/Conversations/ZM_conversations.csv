Zoom is getting the adults in the room.  Cut back on SBC…tuck-in acquisitions..,2024-10-01
No one cares. This is such a poorly run company. I believe it’s a long term short,2024-10-01
"I found this noted that I saved on SA in 2021. ""Sold at a loss ($328) on 6/2/21. Eligible to buy on 7/3/21"". For some reason, I never bought ZM back. Isn't that something that you just don't forget? I would like to see ZM with significant M&A or diversification before I can overcome.",2024-09-27
I sold zm not all that long ago.  The share dilution is expensive.  I will wait and see if they follow through on the promise to lower stock compensation.  Something tells me they won't.  Company also has competition.,2024-09-27
Yea maybe I will sell some puts as well.  But room's free cash flow is perverted when you take into account all the shares they issue and then attempt to buy back.  No free cash flow at all really.,2024-09-27
Thanks for the article. I have sold some puts and considering more aggressive investment in zm. Commenting here so I can track comments. Thanks a bunch for the article.,2024-09-26
@Rleaton I was thinking roughly the same area - around $55,2024-09-24
"@Income Generator I was about to open a pretty sizable position @56 before the stock ran away from me a bit, so emotionally I’d love that level again .In all seriousness I’d love a little more margin of safety from here given that their return to growth story is still very speculative. Although admittedly I could see a scenario where we never see 50’s again",2024-09-24
@Rleaton Thank you!Which price levels are you watching as a possible entry point?,2024-09-24
Last quarternet income $219 milStock based comp $237 milGonna begin to stop this next year over the next two years. Any wonder the stock dropped 80% from the highs,2024-09-24
"Thanks for the piece. It’s on my watchlist, hoping for a slightly better entry though. This company is a cash flow monster.",2024-09-24
This is the right move.  Pau each employee what they are worth.  Account for ir correctly.   I literally sold my shares a month ago or so cause of this reason.,2024-09-22
@Rleaton withholding and tax rate are different. Suggest you learn the delta.,2024-09-21
@123semi in California they definitely are not taxed as ordinary incomeI’m not sure I understand your example.,2024-09-20
@Rleaton bonuses are taxed as ordinary income same as salary. If it wasn’t everyone would have a “salary” of $1 and everything else would also be a “bonus” right?,2024-09-20
@BrownSwiss I don’t think that’s true.RSU’s are taxed as ordinary income. And then again on capital gains.  Cash bonuses are taxed as supplemental income. I’m not sure how options are taxed,2024-09-20
Single digit growth for the last 2yrs.  This should’ve happened sooner.   Turn this into a cash machine.,2024-09-20
"Turns out, when your revenue is flat, only senior leadership gets equity grants and the peons get nothing.",2024-09-20
"@Rleaton tax on bonus is the same as tax on any other income, withholding is moot. Equity doesn’t have capital gains at the time it’s issued and tax rate is the same as any other income. They are just paying you less for the same work.",2024-09-20
"Zoom CEO tells employees stock-based comp will be cut: report04:24 PM | Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (ZM) |Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan told employees that the communications software company is reducing the amount of stock-based compensation they receive, Bloomberg reported.    The 54-year-old Yuan said the rate of stock-based compensation issued to employees, which has become an issue for some public market investors, is ""not sustainable"" and needs to be reduced. “We grant a significant amount of shares each year that has led to very high dilution,"" Yuan wrote in the email, according to the news outlet. “Put simply, we are granting too much equity and must proactively reduce it.”",2024-09-20
