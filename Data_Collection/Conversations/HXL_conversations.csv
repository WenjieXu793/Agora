@T_PNW I know more about BA than you think. Please don't generalize based on this HAZMAT requirement. Outliers can't be used to justify giving insane hikes to 30000 workers. I have seen the assembly. Boeing is an integration shop and most subsystems are done by their Tier 1 subs. Now there are some highly skilled test engineers who are paid highly. Aside from them it is just a nut job.,2024-09-18
"@T_PNW well it was not my plan to submit a  700 page due diligence report. Cost of labor per plane is 15 percent of which 5 percent is union labor. Just so as you know in this low margin business if 5 percent becomes 7 percent that is a full 200 bps margin erosion. That's provided Boeing can make money. Manufacturing business is a game of managing tiny margins and cost elements which I think someone like you has no knowledge of. Manufacturing anything in Washington state is a fools job. When I say transition to Arkansas it meant a gradual disciplined transition. One element a time until everything is hollowed out. These unions, strikes and other methods to alter wages when market forces don't allow are akin to playing yesterday's game. It is you who needs the advice of some pro with investing not me.",2024-09-18
@Tiger231 I guess this answers my question about how clueless you are….completely.You believe other states are willing to offer better tax incentives?  You think there are zero expenses involved in moving such a large production to another state?  Have you bothered to realize how negligible the cost of labor is per airplane?Don’t quit your fast food job…your lack of due diligence in investing clearly isn’t going to help you.,2024-09-17
@T_PNW well then maybe all jobs and plant needs to shift to Arkansas. I am sure these nut job mechanics are available aplenty down south. As a shareholder do I care about Washington state. Not at all.,2024-09-17
@Tiger231 haha how clueless are you?  You make it sound like the cost of living around Seattle is the same as Arkansas.,2024-09-17
In a break from typical Boeing leadership….Ortberg should request $1.00 per year for salary/compensation until Boeing regains profitability & strike is settled. This would send a huge message to the entitled and embittered  IAM workforce. Buying a modest $4.1 million house in Seattle hardly demonstrates integrity or a commitment to fix this sad pup we call Boeing.,2024-09-16
@ContyC - they are losing $ because of overpaid management's incompetence and hubris. Clearly they need engineers at the top again.,2024-09-15
"@Tiger231 did you read the facts?Not 84K per person,  $19 to $34 hour25% over 4 years is basically cost of living",2024-09-15
The question remains at a salary of 84K per person for this nut job what are the unions looking for since they are already paid 40% more than any other machinist? This is beyond ludicrous at this point.,2024-09-15
"No matter how much cash the company is bleeding, the unions are not satisfied. When a company is losing money, asking for pay raises and striking is just absurd. But they do this because they know taxpayer money will bail them out if the company fails.",2024-09-15
"@MySami   Before a bankruptcy filing, it will more likely raise needed capital by selling shares and (unfortunately) diluting existing shareholders.",2024-09-15
"@MySami Yes. Chapter 11 of course. The USA would never let them fail. Too important to our perverse capitalist system. So the USA and taxpayers will bail them out. Under Chapter 11 they will walk away from debts, leaving many others holding the bag. Then they can emerge a few years later under the prestigious Boeing name. After a while people will forget the damage done by mismanagement, just like the rest of the Chapter 11 survivors, GM, Delta, United Airlines, Sears, AIG, etc.  Chapter 11 should be abolished. If you mismanage your business then you go out of business. Others can pick up the pieces and move on.",2024-09-15
On the one hand it’s one of two main producers of commercial planes with a backlog that will last basically forever and a huge moat due to the complexity of the business. On the other hand…everything. I can’t imagine so many things going wrong at a single major company. I keep thinking “this is the last cockroach” but…no.,2024-09-15
