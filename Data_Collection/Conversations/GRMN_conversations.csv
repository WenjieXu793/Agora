Exited my $GRMN position in August.  Almost a double with a nice divi.  Will get back in at a better entry point.  Too far extended for me.,2024-09-22
@Optionputter fair point. Share price has appreciated a ton over the past year.,2024-09-22
"What dividend? The current yield is so small it wonâ€™t even cover inflation. I like the Company, but not the current valuation.",2024-09-22
I really do not understand the motivation for Dividend Collectuh marketing articles through BT's  iREIT.,2024-09-22
They're saying it's the end of Garmin in our time.,2024-09-13
@PanicFirst @The Real Cavalier I would not buy the dip.  You need to look deeper into the markets they serve.  $MPX and other companies in the boat building business are slowing down.  Look at the general aviation business and look at the sales of new and used planes.  They are all slowing down and prices are dropping.  Business aviation is having its own problems.  I sold my $GRMN a month ago.  There will be plenty of opportunities to pick up shares at a much lower price.,2024-09-13
buy the dip.  hardly any of this stuff matters for quality companies in fed markets.,2024-09-13
That's aggressive.  Don't see an analyst go out on a limb like that very often.  He's not going to get a lot of time for a question on the earnings conference call.  Payback is forthcoming.,2024-09-13
