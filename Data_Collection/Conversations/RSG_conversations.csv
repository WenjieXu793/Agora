@Kirk Spano In order to get back to better there may be some resistance but that bit of resistance is far better for the future than the destruction we are seeing now.,2024-10-02
@boris gudonov Every one of these investment firms have a list. Maybe they're pitching their book. They want you to buy the price up! ;-),2024-10-02
"@golfcat1 we ought to control the border, but, we ought to be issuing enough work visas and green cards to offset Boomer retirements. That requires millions of immigrants per year.",2024-10-01
@santlo It won't. Markets will tank if the weird guys take over. They are a threat to democracy and capitalism.,2024-09-30
"@erbrown Don’t bet the farm on that. I don’t see cap gain tax on unrealized gains. For openers, evaluations are impossible, not only for the likes of farm land but also for 1000 shares of a publicly-traded stock, liquidity is a big deal. Then there’s the velue of the local family business. Not so fast.",2024-09-29
Stock Market at record levels under Biden-Harris …why will change  to Trump be better for market?,2024-09-29
"The market is pricing this as one of the safest investments on the market today. I had the same concerns when I bought it at all time highs. I can comfort myself paying premium prices knowing that stocks like this have low volatility and low beta… meaning there is a good likelihood they will outperform in a broad drawdown. Last time I checked, RSG has a higher FCF yield than WM right now despite the outperformance. I would be comfortable having 15% of my portfolio in these two stocks, 2/3 RSG and 1/3 WM. Still buying!",2024-09-26
"@Leo Nelissen I certainly could be wrong, but felt the Healthcare waste business buyout was a negative. I forgot the name now. I did sell WM for a decent gain. I should have not sold RSG. My bad.",2024-09-25
"I agree with you that RSG is a perfect stock to own- and so does Bill Gates who owns billions of RSG and WM- but the problem is that it is now fully valued. I bought RSG and WM about 12 years ago when their valuations and yields were much more attractive, and as a result, the two of these give me 36.8K of annual income. They are never sells to me.",2024-09-25
"A great long term sector and one of the top names therein. I like WM better and have been long for decades. Too rich currently, I'd be willing to add, perhaps significantly, on a pull back of 25% or more. If I were @Leo Nelissen 's age and not retired, I'd be more aggressive.",2024-09-25
"I would love to own some shares of either $RSG or $WM, but very difficult to catch at a fair value. I am with you on waiting for a pullback, but patience is required. Great business, more garbage created every day!!! Thanks for the quality article!!!",2024-09-25
"Leo, Great piece, and you sum up RSG well.  Want to own it, likely will.Have WM.  Believe it's more of a technology leader.  Trucks have a driver and no one else (although they come back around if the robot arms don't get it done).  RSG, more old style, operational costs on human pickups.  WM also has the 'bags' one can buy @ HD that will hold tons of refuse (think home demos) with, one driver, automated arms.  Both are great.  The goal should be to own the duopoly, and that is mine.  Will fill out WM, then start on RSG.  It goes slowly as both are expensive (historically true).  Market drops, will take a lot w/it.  That would be a gift.  Thanks again.Alex.",2024-09-24
32x earnings ??   Pass.Thats the only problem. Its just too expensive.,2024-09-24
"The RSG valuation problem is market wide. Pretty much every high quality stock like WM and COR have traded down or sideways for the last 3-6 months.  The new high SPX is clearly hyper focused in high flyers like MSFT, Costco, Walmart, and Lilly. Opportunities generally appear less opportune as summer turns to fall and skepticism is reborn again. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with selling gains into Cape 36+ extraordinary valuations. Sell with gains into strength. Buy on uncomfortable weakness. Never sell into uncomfortable weakness. Add on reasonable prospects with a margin of error. The margin of error appears to be thin or non-existent.  Prospects appear hypnotically forged.",2024-09-24
"I like RSG, but I don’t understand why you like them better than WM. Am I missing something? I think both are expensive right now and I’ve been waiting for WM to drop some before adding it.",2024-09-24
"Another good article from Leo!RSG is buyable on the 10-15% pullback you want to see. At the moment, it does not deserve a place in our family's main portfolio that I trimmed down to 26 holdings today by selling CRM when it popped this morning.RSG and WM are great companies that are both on my Watch List, will be resilient in an economic downturn, and continue to grow over time. Unfortunately, my time horizon is much shorter than yours, making the low current yield of 1% (although it will grow over time) and the current p/e ratio of 32 (which will decline over time as earnings increase) unappealing to me.",2024-09-24
@slodon28 of course it will - just ask Milton Friedman. Spending leads to inflation (Why I sold any bond holding/ blended fund before 2022). Don't make this so hard.,2024-09-16
@TJ Burke Wont all of that NEW that government spending increase inflation?,2024-09-16
Spending will take off again under Harris. All her initiatives require new spending. It's objective reality and your lack of policy awareness or shallow partisanship does not change it.,2024-09-15
Communism or Capitalism. Hmmm Wonder which will be good for the stock market?,2024-09-15
