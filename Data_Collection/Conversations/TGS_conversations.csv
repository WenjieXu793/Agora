"I am always glad to see analysis on TGS … I was getting lonely being a holder for the last decade, but a 500% gain eased the solitude.  Unfortunately I was hoping for more in the analysis…actually went back to be sure it wasn’t from August 2023.  My observation … how can you have current analysis without mentioning…shouting… Vaca Muerta !   How can you mention Macri and not mention Milei?  Mr Pelican has radically changed the expectations of private sector takeover of all industries, most centrally making FDI in hydrocarbons a top of the list priority.  So unfortunately we’ve got a small fraction of the TGS story told here…we need more specific to the likely plans for doubling the pipeline capacity for Vaca Muerta ASAP.   Any insights are welcomed please!",2024-09-27
