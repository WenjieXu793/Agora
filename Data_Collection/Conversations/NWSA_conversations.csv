"@nerd_rage Exactly. If you look at the NY Times, they did what you said, which is to implement the charge but also to add more value. So for example there's also the Wirecutter (which arguably covers the cost of the subscription by itself), the expanded Cooking section, etc. I don't know why more of these companies don't follow in the footsteps of one of the only news companies that's shown how you can actually make money at the game.",2024-10-08 11:23:09.759103
"@RealRural If you're monetizing a previously free product, you better have one hell of a product and CNN is hardly that.And no I'm not complaining that CNN is too biased and left wing. I've observed that people don't pay for news at all anymore. They get it for free from YouTube and social media. CNN is not the only free news site out there, so if they slap up a paywall, why wouldn't everyone say okay bye and move onto something else.If CNN were high quality (either you think that now or it could become better), that wouldn't help either because high quality news is not what people are looking for. They might say that but what they're really looking for is bias confirmation.Some people might pay for a news site that is an echo chamber reflecting their own beliefs back at them. That's why Fox News is still in business. Ironically they're losing audience to news outlets even more radical and right wing. That's the problem with going into the bias confirmation business.CNN does need to change, both their site and their streaming efforts (which are now part of Max). But are they going to improve their products so that people might value them enough to pay or just hold out their hand and say gimmee because that sure isn't going to work.There are few online publications that are making a paywall work. The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal. The latter is more of a business journal than general news site. People will pay for that because their profession requires them to.But if I just want to find out what is blowing up in the Middle East today, I don't need CNN for that. It's all over the internet.",2024-10-08 11:23:09.759103
CNN+ was such a glaring success they are going for the money again.,2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@Tschurin Unlike AP, Reuters covers a lot more business stories and has a wider geographical base. Will indeed be interesting to see how this evolves.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@nerd_rage ""One would assume.."".An assumption is just that, a guess. In this case, a guess that missed the mark. Many products are given away for free and then monetized, it is the way of the digital world, no enhancements needed. People get hooked or realize they enjoy/benefit/learn from an online site and then have to decide whether they will pay for it. This is an inexorable trend that is devolving from the ""Internet Is Free!"" mantra that started decades ago. Most major mainstream media news sites are subscription based, since it costs real money to provide news coverage, pay salaries and travel costs and reputable and experienced staff (as opposed to opinion/blather). Many magazines that were once free now charge as well. The consuming public has adapted to accept this model -- enhancements come AFTER the paywall goes up, as has occurred at many online pubs. The big question here is what will they charge and how many people will value CNN enough to pay it? CNN will indeed have to entice new subscribers with value added as they evolve.  Or they could do like Politico, which has subscribers for a higher tier of specialized info, and an open tier to lure folks in. Will be interesting to follow.",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@RealRural The core problem is, once people are used to getting something for free, it becomes very hard to convince them that it's worth paying money for.Compounding that is the death of cable TV. I know two people who still have cable; the two oldest people I know. Younger people get news for free from all over and not much from CNN.com. There's a lot of news being released on social media and YouTube, even people who set themselves up as experts and run their own news organizations out of their home. Some of those are out and out crackpots but the crackpots seem to have more traction than CNN type normal news organizations. Everyone prefers their own echo chambers.And it's not just right wing echo chambers with their fake news. I know people to the left of Che Guevara who think CNN etc are all government funded CIA psyops so where do they go? YouTube crackpots.This is a huge problem for news but I haven't seen any indication that CNN etc are realistically addressing it. Just taking something that was free and slapping a price tag on it, is no solution. What's the enhancement that justifies the price tag?",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"People have been getting Product A for free. Then the company starts charging. One would assume that Product A has now been enhanced with something it didn't have before, to justify slapping a price on something that was valued at $0. But I see no indication of an enhancement to the product.Conclusion: this will be a dismal failure.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@MWinMD Right, but if you can get it elsewhere, why would you pay Reuters directly to get it?",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@Caywyn I read Reuters all the time.  They rally are where ""the news"" gets a lot of their news.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
"CNN actually has a fairly large online direct to consumer business (as opposed to CNN Newswire), this might generate a bit of additional revenue for them. Reuters though, who goes to Reuters directly for news?",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
@RealRural thank you. I figured there was one person out there that would gladly pay for CNN. You are apparently it.,2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
"Reading and watching news sites for free, considering the costs of maintaining news organizations as large and comprehensive as CNN, especially with its correspondents abroad, has never made a lot of sense. Sometimes we donâ€™t realize the value of something until it is taken away. Many credible and excellent media organizations already have a pay wall and it is working for them. Not surprised that Reuters and CNN are going this route.Will be interested to see how this goes. CNN already collect revenues from having its news and broadcasts bundled and streamed. If you want to see what is going on in the Middle East right now, CNN and probably Al Jazeera are going to be important to watch.As for the poor trolls who have made comments below, they should look up the word irony, and take to heart the words of their dear leader, which is: fake news.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
