Good product and great company but the valuation is stretched to the extreme,2024-09-29
"I will stick with CDNS, one of two stocks operating as a duplopoly in the sector.  If one waits until higher earnings come in, it will be far too late.  Because of where this operates (duopoly in AI and chips and medicine), it will NEVER be a cheap stock.  Something that the analyst somehow forgot to mention.Also, beware of the words ""could be"".  If Medusa appears, I could be turned to stone.  See how that works.",2024-09-25
