"Thanks for the good article.When you mention ""At the time of writing, the company trades at a P/E below 7x"", that already take into account the legacy minority interests in the business?",2024-08-23
@MUGSLEY Good points TY.  I agree with you and I thought they still had a fair amount of floating debt.,2024-08-22
"@dondougie Why do you think rate cuts benefit RPRX? I would argue the opposite. Their debt is fixed at low 3% after their latest refi. And, with a healthy cash position & high free cash flow, they are actually earning interest at ~5% and offsetting much of the debt service cost. Most importantly with higher rates, their pipeline should increase as more entities w/ high quality products may need to shore up liquidity in tighter credit markets, thus pursuing a deal with RPRX. You could argue lower discount rates  w/ lower interest rates, but that is generally offset by lowering the IRR hurdle on future deals as deals become more competitive. And hypothetical multiple expansion seems totally irrelevant to discuss. considering the multiple was much higher in 2022 when rate hikes were on the horizon & business model/cf was less proven than today. Also, the inflation and geopolitical uncertainty, CRE bubble, really have no impact on their cfs.  Similar to Mare, in summary, I would say the uncertainty around the dispute in the CF royalty is the biggest hurdle today along with some general ambiguity of how their business model is structured & compounds long term. Any kind of resolution here would help stock momentum. If you want to better understand the CF royalty, they provide a slide in the appendix of their investor day presentation that really simplifies the impact to their business.",2024-08-22
