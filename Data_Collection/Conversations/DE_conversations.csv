@anelsen15 We mfg large equipment. Our only competitors are Canadian companies. In 30 yrs I’ve not had one customer buy from us vs Canadian due to nationalism. Oh and we are the SAME on price…..some would say we are higher quality but imo we’re equal.,2024-09-27
"@JazzPaw Tariffs and counter tariffs generally lead to higher prices for consumers. Tariffs: When a country imposes tariffs (taxes) on imported goods, the cost of those goods increases. Importers often pass these additional costs onto consumers, resulting in higher prices for imported products.Countertariffs: When the targeted country retaliates with its own tariffs on exports from the first country, it can lead to a trade war. This reduces the availability of certain goods, leading to fewer choices and potentially higher prices for consumers.Domestic Price Adjustments: Domestic producers might also raise their prices because the competition from cheaper imported goods is reduced. This can further contribute to higher prices for consumers.Overall, while tariffs aim to protect domestic industries, they often result in increased costs for consumers due to higher prices on both imported and domestic goods.During the period from 2016 to 2020, Canada imposed counter tariffs on a variety of items in response to tariffs imposed by other countries, particularly the United States. Some of the key items included:Steel and Aluminum Products: Various steel and aluminum products were targeted due to the U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.Agricultural Products: Items such as yogurt, coffee, and maple syrup were included.Consumer Goods: Products like toilet paper, washing machines, and dishwashers were also subject to counter tariffs.Industrial Goods: Items such as plywood, paper products, and certain types of machinery were included.These counter tariffs were part of Canada’s strategy to protect its industries and economy from the impact of foreign tariffs.Tariffs did have an impact on Whirlpool’s profits. The company faced challenges due to the tariffs, which affected their profits. However, Whirlpool managed to counteract some of the negative effects by raising prices on their products.",2024-09-27
"@Tim aWalz's Family Loves Trump They did not leave.They are still being hired by Americans to do work American refuse to do.Statista is not a government website. It is a global data and business intelligence platform that provides statistics, reports, and insights on a wide range of topics. Statista was established in Germany in 2007 and operates as a private company. It gathers data from various sources, including government agencies, but it is not itself a government entity.",2024-09-26
"@Tim aWalz's Family Loves Trump American demand may increase, but at the expense of other purchases because the products will cost more.However, other countries will counter with tariffs of their own, and American companies will lose that business, unless they move production out of the US.Tariffs are essentially a tax on the consumer. No importer will eat the costs, and neither will the exporting companies. Their margins would be killed.",2024-09-26
@wboz You explained the PPP perfectly. That’s exactly how it worked and didn’t work. The bank relationship was everything. Small business without a CPA or someone to run with this non stop was at a disadvantage. You didn’t mention hotels and others were incorporated in various entities similar to Trumps famous gazillion companies each got paid. This turned into a huge scam but not a lot was done. Then you had EIDL loans that companies took but now complaining they have to pay back. wtf it was a loan not a gift. 30 yr low low interest. I have one $150K paying it back slowly. We took advantage of what was offered because we didn’t know what was coming. If you recall these programs were time sensitive at the beginning. It was a huge waste of money but no one wants to talk about facts when you can blame Biden.,2024-09-26
@Tim aWalz's Family Loves Trump we will see the evidence at trial. He will probably cop a plea. DOJ wouldn’t indict him unless they have clear evidence of intent. I doubt I’m wrong on this.,2024-09-26
"@kmi So, you don’t like taxation. How much government would you cut?We will have a military, a court system, DOJ, Treasury and State Dept, at least. That costs nearly $1T per year. Where do we get the money.We have designated Social Security and Medicare obligations. We have interest on the national debt. More $$$!I’m a blue state, rich liberal who pays lots of taxes to bailout lots of poorly run red states. I’d love to get rid of the federal income tax, and fund government with per capita assessments on the state governments. My state would stop being the sucker that pays everyone else’s bills.",2024-09-26

"@georgefelix75 Yes. The first checks were delayed because Don insisted that Treasury figure out a way to print his signature on them. It wasn't a meaningful delay, but it shows whether he cared about the people or the PR. Unfortunately, they don't write his name on ""inflation"" to match later.PPP - Had a friend with a small biz in NYC. She called her banker, but because she had not borrowed large sums in the past, he ignored her calls until he could get millions for his other clients. The PPP funds ran out, her business went bust, and she fired everybody. It was an asset-lite business, and she started it again later, but of course without any money there was 0 back pay to be had.Meanwhile here's how PPP worked for big biz: You had a bunch of employees that could keep working anyway. You got a loan amount for each of them. As long as you didn't fire them by the end, you got to KEEP the money for just running your business as it was - there was no requirement it be a business that had furloughed workers. Pure handouts. (Some fraud, too, but the non fraudulent portion was equally useless). This would end up inflationary as well, tho it's not easy to tell if it went to asset price inflation (stonks) or corporate PP&E investments.These ever-less-productive rounds of stimulus continued into the Biden admin as well. And now, takeout for the fam costs $70 instead of $38 ... I have a list on the back of the cabinet with pre-covid costs from various places. The US is currently borrowing at ... 4%? And GDP growth is 3%. That's actually better than it has been, but it's a negative rate of return on borrowing ...",2024-09-26
"@georgefelix75 i didn't need it at all. it was like $400, multiple times (3?) because I had a child. the child is well cared for already, no extra spending happened on them because i got money. the first check proudly had Donald J Trump's name on it, i remembered that.",2024-09-26
"@georgefelix75 I complained when they sent me checks for doing nothing. And I'm complaining now, for being 20% poorer than I had been.",2024-09-26
@georgefelix75 Election right around the corner. Is OPEC going to help keep the current admin in power?www.reuters.com/...,2024-09-26
@ihookem Omg inflation was a function of Covid shortages when the economy re-opened. We had no workers and we couldn’t get half the material we needed. Everything was a cluster in the supply chain. Do you have a very short memory or just don’t understand the impact of closing the world down and trying to start it back up? FYI when I say “we” I’m talking about my company but it was nationwide both big and small companies were in chaotic conditions. That lasted over a year. Some products never came back and we’ve had to find alternatives. Covid wasn’t nothing.,2024-09-26
"@georgefelix75 There was no covid inflation.No one was buying cars, houses , or gas.  Food has not had deflation. If so , where , what how much and when??  Food is up 40% in 4 yrs. and you think it just went back down. Down how much? 2.5%?   So we are still up 37.5% on food. You can't just say there is food deflation. That is crazy .  You are picking your time line again and it's very short term and likely temporary. When did food ever go down in in over 3 yrs.?  You are not telling the truth and moving the goal post every time you say you are interested in today and tomorrow.  You say wages are permenent, and so are prices. They dont really go back down.  IMR rifle powder is $73.00 lb. and 3 yrs ago it was $35.00.   My home owners went from $650 to $1,547. My auto went from $640 to $800. My liabilty on my business ins. went from $432 to $680 in 4 yrs. Tires are up 40%?  in 4 yrs. My electric is up 14.4% in 2 yrs. ( We Energies.) .  What on earth are you talking about... But hey , wait ,,, I saw milk at Aldi's for $2.62 and it was $2.99 so all is better now!!  Heck, the old lady that sells me her eggs is beside herself . Even chicken feed is way up.",2024-09-26
@JazzPaw The only way to make tariffs work is to create an isolationist economy. Nothing in and very little out,2024-09-26
@JazzPaw Yeah and China will just sell to Canada or Mexico then it gets resold in the US. That’s a great opportunity for Mexico. It helps zero Americans. The only thing it does is upset the supply chain and increase cost. My company is absolutely not bringing that back because we outsourced for a reason. Trump is about going backwards and making it sound like progress.,2024-09-26
"@georgefelix75   You dont take data on what it is over a 1 or 3 month period unless  you are trying to  tilt the numbers to your desire. In less that 4 yrs. almost everything is up at least 25%. By your thinking , it never happened because it is now only 2.5% over the last 3 months is not how you measure inflation. You know this . Also, the same bunch that were off by 818,000 jobs in the first 8 months are the same type of cronies that are telling us in is now 2.5% and that is was transitory .. Again,, they LIE!",2024-09-26

"@kmi Tariffs will not gain GDP. What we gain in on shore manufacturing we lose by other countries tariffing our exports. And, Americans pay the tariffs, NOT foreigners. Tariffs also raise the cost of other production, making it uncompetitive in world markets.",2024-09-26
