@EliasMouawad Thanks for reading! PFE still looks like a great deal as well.,2024-10-04
"Interesting article. I am long PFE but unfortunately, the stock has failed to rise above $30",2024-10-04
A 13% increase per year in port labor costs won't be inflationary will it?,2024-10-02
"Everyone will be impacted one way or the other. Earlier this year, Biden joined the picket lines, striking the auto industry. Let’s see if he does the same, as a tightening supply chain will surely affect inflation.",2024-10-01
Isn't this anti-competitive?  Maybe the DOJ should bring an anti-trust action to force them to stay in these lines and promote competition.,2024-09-28
I have a small position @$49.55 cost.  Will write $150 puts.  If exercised I'll have a position @ ~$115.  If not I'll keep the premium and do it again.,2024-09-27

Take advantage of the current low price and REINVEST the Healthy Dividends.Years from now you will be quite happy...imo.Long   JNJ and staying there.,2024-09-25
Long time buy and hold position for me. My guess the next decade for JNJ will be better than the last,2024-09-25
"If you’re gonna buy J&J anytime in the next three years, you should buy it now. If you own it, you should definitely not sell it until the talc lawsuit is settled. jnj has been stagnant for years for one reason and one reason only and that is the talc lawsuit. As soon as that gets settled jnj will revert to mean…. Longer-term JNJ is a buy because of its pipeline of amazing med-tech… lots of pent-up price… no  institutional investor will buy when there is a lawsuit overhanging.",2024-09-24
@ErpichtAuf exchange for what? Kenvue? Should never have been spun and Jnj shareholders should have been compensated and I mean all of us not just a few who took the previous swap that was grossly over subscribed. I feel cheated.,2024-09-24
I have to agree . I’ve been long for 40 years. Too much capital gains to ever sell. Will pass on to heirs to sell. Dividends come quarterly and go up every year. I’m not happy with current leadership . Kenvuecwas a disaster. Shareholders got nothing! Where is the promised growth. Interesting no mention of talc in your analysis. I believe it is responsible for 5 years of no growth in stock price . Is third time the charm when it comes to bankruptcy attempt. Even if Texas judge approved there will be appeals probably up to scotus. Jnj at war with one plaintiff lawyer named Andy birchfield. It’s a ridiculous situation holding up settlement.  I’d love to sell but won’t pay the AMT. .,2024-09-24
"JNJ is possibly still adjusting to the changes they have somewhat recently made.I'm willing to wait and see how they adjust to their reasonably new circumstances.I am not interested in selling at this time, but I'd consider exchanging IF the offer is sufficiently interesting.",2024-09-24
"Thanks for the article. Good info on the upcoming pharmaceutical efforts. However, much of the backbone of this company is medical equipment, and should at least be mentioned. The payments for new and used equipment, along w/ maintenance plans, provides much of the lifeblood that keeps JNJ slowly growing forward...",2024-09-24
J&J is one of the many evil companies that the US govt allows to slowly murder people starting when they are babies. Finally proven beyond doubt. Their entire leadership should go to prison. I would never put a penny in their stock to support their evil business practices.,2024-09-23
"""We're at 16.6X forward earnings.......JNJ is quite expensive""LMAO.  Well, I'm going to take my 16.6x forward earnings and hold steady.  ;)",2024-09-23
Sold 1/3 of my JNJ holdings in August 2023 for over $172.  No regrets doing that.  Too many talc lawsuits that just never seem to go away.,2024-09-23
"I was wondering. This is the 4th time I’ve owned JNJ. It always bounces up, tops & retreats back to where you purchased. I sell soon as it drops 2% after 10+% gain.",2024-09-23
"Thanks,  I agree with your call so sold a covered call on portion of position.I used proceeds to pick up some shares in ETFs prior to ex date.",2024-09-23
"I agree with this call. I did sell JNJ a month or so ago for more than $166 after purchasing it earlier in the year for $145. I didn't expect to get a quick 15% gain on something so safe, but decided that there was minimal remaining upside and that the dividend was not a sufficient reason to keep the stock when there were other alternative choices with similarly high dividend yields but more substantial upside potential.",2024-09-23
