"Stephen. Thanks for a very nicely done article on DCI.  They are a very well run operation, but usually sell for a premium.  I’ve been long for many years, but agree with your assessment that the current valuation is a bit high.DCI has been a consistent share buyback company as can be seen in the dwindling outstanding share count over the years. But it’s not necessarily a good thing when shares are priced dearly.",2024-08-22
