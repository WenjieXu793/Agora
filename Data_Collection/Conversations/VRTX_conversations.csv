"@zerosum85 Vertex has always maintained it is NOT better than opioids!It It fits in the niche just below opioids. One of its benefits is, since it is not central nervous system related, but peripheral,  it can be piggybacked on current prescriptions. We need to readjust and see how it is used and received. Feedback is most MDs will at least try it with their patients and see what kind of patient feed back they getJust getting an MD to write a new drug script is always the hardest aspect of commercialization with a new drug. MDs have maybe 20-30 drugs or so they are very comfortable with, and they stick to those scripts. I'd like some of our MDs here on the boards to tell us what their comfort level is a to numbers they tend to rescript over and over.I'm curious over the years if this changes.",2024-09-29
"Do not see my comment, so I get a do over! VX548 can be combined with/piggybacked with current prescriptions NOW, since it is not central nervous system related, but peripheral",2024-09-29
"VX 548 can be piggy backed with other existing pain meds now! Reason being it is not central nervous system related, but peripheral.",2024-09-29
IMO VX will eventually be combined with other pain meds to be even more or as effective as opioids…,2024-09-28
@borgesjvcm I don't think it's going to treat those illness but we'll see.,2024-09-24
"@New Adams  Yes, for the time being.  If VX-548 is approved, this stock 's performace will look like LLY and NOV after their GLP-1 approvals. The Market will love it.  If the third phase trial continues to show that VX-548 is effective with no serious side effects then their is no reason not to approve it  If it gets approval, doctors will not have much reason not to prescibe it. Hopefully Vertex will not make the mistake of over pricing VX-548. I will wait on the side-lines for approval. That does not mean that I do not like VX-548. It just means that I am cautious.",2024-09-21
"How about use in combination with Ibuprofen?What about VX-548's potential for chronic pain? Opioids are no longer recommended for the treatment of most patients with chronic pain.  There were also few side effects VX-548, supporting Vertex’s case.  Opioids have earned a very negative view by the general public. This will have a positive effect for VRTX stock price if it is approved. Stock prices are not only determined by fundamentals and technical but also by psychology. Physicians may be more prone to prescribing VX-548 to avoid potential law suits by patients.Many patients will request VX-548 out of addiction and withdrawal fears. ""Opioid use — even short term — can lead to addiction and, too often, overdose."" - Mayo Clinic",2024-09-21
"@Chase02 I As I recall VRTX investigation showed most of the chronic pain scripts are written by the primary care MD. in that setting.VRTX has recently reiterated they would partner-up for chronic pain, as that is not a ""Vertexian"" thing. Specialty drugs and commercialization are VRTX areas of focus. Strict business model again. They know what they do well and stick to it.How the chronic pain would be marketed, assuming it gets approved for that would be up to their partner. They would have the expertise how to market it with an input on cost no doubt,We are probably getting ahead of ourselves. Vertex has ideas I am sure. A lot depends as the studies progress as to what it can do..",2024-09-20
"@New Adams We will have to agree to disagree on that one, at least for now! It seems premature to say the market has spoken, when no one has even had the opportunity to try the drug yet and the FDA has not even reviewed the evidence submiitted.That's like saying you don't like your brothers wife, but BOTH of you  have never met her and he is not married!Like I said; I hope it works, for those in pain; more options are always better. Many of us cannot take NSAIDS, pretty much at all!",2024-09-20
"The data that has been submitted to the FDA shows VX548 as better  than NSAIDS,( which have a lot of potentially nasty side effects), but NOT as good as opioids! VX 548 does not have addictive capabilities. VX548 side effects if any, are minimal and managable. That is why they are asking for a ""moderate to severe acute pain label.""They work good in the niche between NSAIDS and opioids and will be priced accordingly with generics taken in consideration. We will have to see if the FDA agrees the data was sufficient for the ""moderate to severe"" pain label. My understanding is they went out of their way to prove the labeling they are seeking is justified. This label is very important to them. VERTX is known for not wasting money on losers. A sucessful business and it's reputation is built on repeat business. If it does not work, or you can't get people to buy it again, yikes. People don't always remember winners, but they sure as blazes remember the losers. Dumping molecules that are ok, but not up to their standards is frequent . They have been working 20+ yrs. on pain. I can't picture them ruining their reputation for excellence if this drug did not perform as stated!With the new sodium ion planned research, new to them anyway, they hope to make their pain program even better. As SZGCH brought to our attention in this thread , there is a drug using sodium ions in Europe,  but it has lots of side effects which have caused some regulatory problems in some countries. So there is room for improvement! For everyone's sake, lets hope the proof as submitted is good enough! This seems like a good drug for everyone to at least try out. No one drug works well for everyone.",2024-09-20
"@Blo65 It will be very interesting to see if the FDA feels there is enought of the correct data submitted to warrant the ""moderate to severe acute pain"" label they are requesting. To me that says a lot in itself as to the effectiveness of the drug.""",2024-09-19
Looks like The Market has spoken and they do Not like Vertex pain medication. Sorry.,2024-09-17
"@millifiori except UCB SA was the first to target these sodium channels, Vertex is copying.",2024-09-17
@Chase02 this is why Vertex will not have success with its pain med. For severe post surgical pain inpatient I will typically have a patient on oxycodone on a PCA (patient controlled anesthesia) where they press a button to release a dose (the hourly dose is limited and once used the machine locks up). Then after a few days we move to oral capsules when ready to discharge. The patient may need a week or 10 days of decreasing dosages then is moved to non opioid painmeds if pain still persists. Oxycodone generic 10 mg tablets run about $20 for an entire month supply. None of my patients has ever needed an entire month. Opioids are cheap strong and work. You just have to stop when you don’t need them. Anyone who continues to use by buying on the street obviously is going to have an addiction problem. Fortunately most normal people (100% of my patients) would never buy illegal street drugs or even know where to find them. If you adhere to protocol as an anesthesiologist and pain medicine doc I will keep you out of pain during the post op period. It will end. 2-3 weeks is the most anyone almost ever needs.,2024-09-17
"@borgesjvcm If you are in Europe you should know Vimpat- this drug works the same as the so -called wonder drug from Vertex-I posted the same earlier somewhere in regards to VX-548. I think this drug is highly overrated. People like to forget, there is basically a similar drug on the market. Vimpat -Lacosamid -which is inhibiting Nav1.7 and Nav1.8. They block the exact same sodium channel. Not sure why this gets no coverage. in my country in Europe they already give this drug for nerve pain especially. VX-548 is no game changer- as confirmed by my neurologist. I understand they did not get approval in the US for pain. Not surprised as they want to give the big money rather to a US company.But the company which owns the right to Vimpat is skyrocketing anyway - UCB SA",2024-09-16
"We need to remember the govt. is committed to making this work, and so is VRTX price wise. VRTX has 20+ years of research on this drug. They will be adding another pain ion channel for R&D down the road in the not too distant future. It has been announced.  IMHO no one is better than VRTX at working out pricing, based on their history. Pricing seems to be of concern in the comment section.16 states have laws mandating prescribers consider non-opioid alternatives, maybe more by now, as time has passed, all 50 states have opioid prescribing guidelines. No MD wants restrictions on their DEA license. They also need special CME training on pain mgt. The ""No Pain Act"" was passed which creates a separate payment in the outpt. setting. It directs CMS to provide add-on- payments for non-opioid TX ( in addition to bundled payments) in the ASC outpatient settings.There is also incentive in the inpatient acute setting also. I'm sure details are on the internet. The govt. is working out exceptions payment wise on Casgevy also. I only follow VRTX, so I don't know about their competitors.Point being,  If the govt. wants to make exceptions as to payments, they will!The govt. wants to make sure patients who need non-opioid meds get them. As noted above the cost is horendous to society. Ask anyone with acute or chronic pain, all of their energies are focused on just managing the pain. Work productivity, if they can hold down a job is minimal. If I recall there are no known side effects. that I have read about.  Complaints minimal to none. This is a well tolerated drug. Anyone chime in on this one if they recall different. In the Q3/2022 financials out in early Feb. of 2023 the acute pain market alone was figured North of $4B @generic pricing! Food for thought here. So many forms of pain! Diabetic Neuropathy and Lumbo-sacral pain are in studies now.",2024-09-16
As a pain specialist if the Vertex product is inferior to Vicodin (hydrocodone/acetaminophen for a simple bunion treatment then it is not an effective painkiller. Opioids have been over demonized in media. One week of opioids will not addict a person especially not a weak one like hydrocodone which is as weak as morphine ( that’s another story but people think morphine is strong. It’s the weakest opioid in the market excepting quasi fake opioids like Tramadol). This pain med candidate sounds like a failure already,2024-09-16
"@Larry Ramer @Chase02 Yes the financial considerations are probably a bit off due to a wrong comparison - Ajovy is an injectable drug taken once a month for a chronic disease while VX-548:""How is VX-548 taken?VX-548 is an oral tablet that is taken every 12 hours after an initial loading dose.The dose used in the phase 3 clinical trials was a loading dose of 100mg followed by 50mg every 12 hours.""This means that it should have a price point more comparable to COX-2 inhibitors' price (at launch).The real goal of the company should be a price point that will could lead to a very large market share, instead of a 1%ish share.I also think that the chronic pain potential is huge, given the lack of alternatives and side effects of the existing drugs - opioids are no longer recommended for non-cancer chronic pain due to perceived lack of efficacy and abuse potential, anticonvulsants and antidepressives also have addictive potential and lots of side effects.The only study so far is for diabetic polyneuropathy, with good results, but the potential uses include back pain, post herpetic neuralgia, post chemotherapy neuropathy and many other neuropathic pain conditions, excluding . That could mean patients taking the drug everyday... for life.",2024-09-16
Not underestimating Vertex but worried about any financial asset correlated to stocks,2024-09-15
"''VX-548 has shown to be more effective than placebos and potentially more powerful than NSAIDs and ibuprofen in post-surgery pain relief.''Ibuprofen is an NSAID, so I wonder if you (or the editors) meant acetaminophen, which is not. Any thoughts on the side effect profile vs. NSAIDs and acetaminophen, especially long-term and heart, liver, and kidney related?Thanks for a nice article!",2024-09-15
