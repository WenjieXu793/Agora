"Only a dollar below offer. Some investors are selling, those buying must be considering waiting for a counter offer. Only upside from here even if it is just a dollar. I will sell within 1-2 weeks if no ones comes around. Market does not seem to expect a counter though.. Could be Adobe or a competitor looking to build scale. Cash offer is hard to beat though unless you have a large cash on hand and $8bn is not much for a MSFT. There is a 45 day shop period to allow for this to happen.",2024-09-24
Anyone believes on a counter bid? Market does not seem to… 45 go shop window.,2024-09-24

"Good ideas and theory on this press release, but way too much research for this ancient investor. Anyone have recommendations if there is/are mid-cap tech ETFs or CEFs to look at? I'd be happy to get decent performance with diversified tech risk from a mid cap fund.",2024-09-10
"I actually see quite a few solid companies here with share prices that should appreciate considerably, if not immediately. Some names I don't recognize and a few I find questionable but overall not a bad list to generate some ideas for further research.Mid-caps are something my portfolio needs desparately and I would like to open ~5 positions in a few new stocks over the coming weeks (usually 1/4th to 1/3rd the size of what I consider a full position). I'd like at least 3 to be mid-caps. I'm really eyeing TER, but my portfolio is already considerably overweight in the semiconductor industry.",2024-09-10
