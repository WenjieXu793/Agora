"Allstate, and Progressive are going to get crushed.... they have the most exposure.  No one wants to insure in this state which is why Citizens was setup......",2024-10-08 10:47:31.678406
@ny44 package it up and sell it as catastrophe bonds?  But looks like market thinks significant risk is sticking to insurers.,2024-10-08 10:47:31.678406

Not sure why the exact opposite isn't true do not cover the Industry but if they don't pay out they're not writing policies and clearly they will be paying out here the most expensive Hurricane ever clearly en route. Long US Treasuries strong buy,2024-10-08 10:47:31.678406
"@trentbridge Its not always the severity but the type.  If the ground shakes a certain way, then a liquification of the ground can occur and destroy the home.  Yes, Nevada is not high next to Cal, but we get some and we have lots of fault lines.  Albeit, the fault lines may relieve stress more gradual then the Cal ones.",2024-10-08 10:47:31.678406
"Hurricane insurers like acic will be fine. This is what’s known as a second retention event. Basically, they’ll pay the deductible on Helene and the deductible on Milton before extensive reinsurance kicks in. Highly dependent on the name obviously but 3q earnings largely a wash now.Smart money will be buying this",2024-10-08 10:47:31.678406
"@trentbridge As a Nevada resident with earthquake insurance, its basically the same amount as fire, so double the amount.  yes, its expensive, but Nevada has a lot of earthquakes, albeit small.  However, I felt a few that if it were a little rougher, it could do some damage.",2024-10-08 10:47:31.678406
@thumbsoup I doubt re-insurance will want to take on the risk.,2024-10-08 10:47:31.678406
"@Jared Wright I don't think a statewide mutuel model works - as you suggest.  Hurricanes are widespread disasters, worse than tornadoes or earthquakes. It would need to be Federal like flooding insurance.   Having lived in California, I know that the state's earthquake insurance policy was never cheap and widely ignored.  A twenty percent deductible based on the home's value was a massive deterrent.  Congress should divert some FEMA funds to establishing a national re-insurance plan for these vulnerable areas.",2024-10-08 10:47:31.678406
"Given the share price drops, I am assuming these insurers are not fully covered by re-insurance?  There is a catastrophe bond market, which interests me because of the increasing damage from storms etc may or may not be covered by the premiums. Two related funds are not dropping today.

"@trentbridge We're going to find out what mutual insurance without profit motive looks like for Florida when Citizens takes a whack after this storm, unfortunately. The sad reality is that taking on the hurricane risk of owning property in Florida would drive most property owners in Florida out of the state. Insurers are less and less willing to subsidize Florida property owners. It will probably end up falling on the federal government and at the end of the day a huge number of people are going to have to move.",2024-10-08 10:47:31.678406
@kjseagle1 I first bought in 2022 when it had lower valuation multiples. I was trying to copy Warren Buffet by buying insurance companies at a discount.,2024-10-08 10:47:31.678406
