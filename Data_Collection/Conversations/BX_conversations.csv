"@FROGBERT Thank for the analysis. Other than IFRS NAV $14.3, what other evidence shows BX gets a good deal? The P/FFO is 20x in the end, which seems in line with TCN's competitors which are all trading at ~20x.",2024-09-30
"finance.yahoo.com/...""Both Mamik and Yonan will be joining BXCI as partners in the infrastructure and asset-based credit group which is led by Rob Horn, Blackstone’s global head of infrastructure and asset-based credit.BXCI’s infrastructure and asset based group has about $75 billion in assets under management and has committed more than $20 billion this year...""",2024-09-30
BX has many levers from which to choose - I'm a long time holder from the days of the financial crisis and have full faith this management team will continue to deliver with its most diversified business model yet.,2024-09-25
"@JohnJRey1945 You may be able to add, but you cannot spell.  “Through” instead of “Throw”.  “Beleive” instead of “Believe”",2024-09-23
@Tyler Okland  They may have sold a number of locations prior to this.  Just guessing.,2024-09-21
"@Tyler Okland No one outside BX knows the exact details, but it is possible.They spend $1.9 B to buy it, then they earn $200MM per year in profits for the 12 years they own it, then they sell it for $500MM.  So net earnings would have been $2.4B, less the $1.4B loss on the purchase/sale, yields a net gain of $1B.I'm making those numbers up, but that is how you would reconcile the statements.Even if true, the IRR on such a deal is far below BX's standards.  If you imagine they have an internal cost of capital of 10%, then the $200MM return on $1.9B investment is basically only equal to the cost of capital.",2024-09-21
"Can you do a better job of explaining how buying for $2 B and selling for $0.5 B results in 3X return and $1 B in profit?It's not that I don't believe it, but if you're going to report this do the work of explaining how the presented math is positive for BX. Thanks.",2024-09-21
"BX buys M6 for $1.9B sells for $525M. From the way the transaction is written in the article, It seems to be a lousy outcome for BX. Even with $1B in profits over time it seems short of the $1.9B purchase.",2024-09-21
@Azred BX acquired Motel 6 / Studio 6 in 2012 for just shy of $2 billion.BX has made a lot of great deals over the years;  I don't think this is the one they'll be showcasing on Investor Day...,2024-09-21
Oyo's first move will be to change the motel's brand name to Motel 5.,2024-09-21
I bought BX under 100 & continued to buy as it moved to the 70s. Now I’m selling off pieces as it moves to all time highs. I need income so I’m redeploying to higher income.,2024-09-13
That's Blackstone's business.  Buy low sell high.  Gotta love it.,2024-09-13
"Hi @KrazyGuy, thank you for your question.Many of Blackstone's funds are private market funds that are only available to accredited investors.So an accredited investor is defined by the SEC as as an individual or entity that meets certain requirements and is eligible to invest in securities that are not registered with the SEC. Accredited investors are considered to be financially sophisticated and have a lower need for the protection that regulatory disclosure filings provide. Usually, this means having to meet certain criteria, such as a 200k annual income or one million in net worth.Blackstone markets its funds through private banking platforms or directly with institutional investors and high-net-worth clients. But Blackstone also has a couple of listed funds for retail investors such as BXSL, SRLN, and HYBL.",2024-09-10
@Stratos Capital Partners Is the Blackstone Real Estate Partners Asia III listed in USA markets?,2024-09-10
"Hi @Swamp Thing, thank you for your comments.Indeed, Blackstone has also been growing their exposure in India. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, they are adding US$25 billion worth of investment into India over the next five years, and have added 20 more professionals to its 75-person team based in Mumbai.www.bloomberg.com/...Blackstone already has about $50 billion of private equity and real estate assets in India, including data centers, infrastructure, and renewables. We do not have the right expertise to provide any analysis or recommendations on specific funds. But we believe that the Real Estate Partners Asia Fund III (BREP Asia III) would probably have the largest exposure to India.",2024-09-09
@Stratos Capital Partners  can you identify which blackstone securities are most heavily invested in India? Jon Gray has been talking a lot about their economic growth and BX’s investment there.I believe this is fertile ground for investment as our relations with china are changing and am curious if you’ve done any digging as to their exposure to the Indian markets.,2024-09-09
