"@Johnny Skyhook ""I would agree with those reasons but add that China has ambitions as a global hegemon, something difficult to achieve unless it takes leadership on important global issues such as CO2 emissions."" Not really, Chinese companies just need to deliver goods at the cheapest price.",2024-10-06
"@Bob-in-DE The study I pointed you to has nothing whatsoever to do with ""depletion write offs"". It’s about the billions in damage that fossil fuels cause that alternative energy sources would not.  Billions that taxpayers have to cover so that fossil fuels can keep pretending to be ""cheap"" energy.You’re watching one major case of this on your nightly news this week.  Who do you think funds the hundreds of millions FEMA spends getting families back on their feet again after the latest superflood?  These megastorms are happening four times as often now as in 1980, due to warming the planet.Same thing for the costs of fighting the western wildfires that have also quadrupled since the 70s.  And many other types of health and infrastructure damage.  These are the implicit subsidies the annual IMF study is tabulating.  Maybe take an actual look at it.",2024-10-05
"@Solar Investing Tesla sells Powerwall's, I just ordered mine, not an economic decision but an electric reliability decision.By the end of 2025, Tesla's energy storage business will generate more revenue and profit than its EV division.",2024-10-05
@J Kimmel what's the resale or trade-in value compared to ICE cars?,2024-10-05
@Bob-in-DE that's your opinion. There are taxi EVs on their original battery with 400k+ miles. Why you think Amazon is switching its delivery fleet to EV. Cause it's cheaper to operate.,2024-10-04
"@J Kimmel I have owned cars for 50 years.  I have never had to replace an engine.  But if I had it would have made economic sense.  The cost is not as great as one might think.EV record is atrocious.  The ""engines"", which is to say the batteries, have a high failure rate.  Replacement is a 20k+ proposition,  No one will replace a battery on an EV.  They will scrap the car.  They will probably have to pay someone to take it away.Even if you come from the ""saving the planet"" crowd, EVs are not the way to do it.  It's really time for the country to grow up on this issue.",2024-10-04
@Tim aWalz's Family Loves Trump $0 for 1st 100k miles. I don't think you realize modern liquid cooled batteries last 4000-5000 charge cycles or about 900k-1.2 million miles.,2024-10-03
@Bob-in-DE My battery is lab tested to last 900k-1.2 million miles. EVs are also significantly less likely to cause a fire vs ICE.Seems like you are spouting nonsense. I appreciate your dedication to my oil stocks though.,2024-10-03
"@Bob-in-DE ""The fossil fuel industry is not subsidized.""The economists at the IMF find otherwise.  So do the analysts at Citicorp, who say that fossil fuel-driven climate change is costing us $44 trillion in present dollars (this analysis was several years ago, and since then we've shattered records every year for damage from extreme weather):www.cnbc.com/...Could you point us to your papers finding otherwise, that heating the planet isn't causing trillions in harms?  I'm sure we'd love to see them.Every industry ""pays taxes"" on their earnings.  And if the food industry ""went away tomorrow"" things would collapse way more certainly than if we shifted to OTHER energy sources.  That doesn't change the fact that getting our energy from fossil fuels has massive off the books costs.",2024-10-02

"@Bob-in-DE The definition of anarchy is being against nearly all forms of external authority, chiefly governments. You have indicated twice in this thread alone that you believe that all governments are ""a problem"" and that they operate ""with impunity"", and are against the interests of ordinary people, i.e. you and ""your friend[s]"". I feel quite certain concluding that the anarchist here is you. There is certainly nothing wrong with being an anarchist in and of itself, but having an indistinguishing hostility to all governments and all government actions will cloud your judgement in circumstances, like this one with NHTSA and Cruise, where government acts to the benefit of the public. It also will not allow you to accurately account for government and regulatory actions in relation to companies in which you hold stock. Having a strong set of beliefs is fine, bit it can be quite problematic when those beliefs prevent you from being able to see objective reality in the realm of finances, e.g. when government regulation of a company or industry is or would be a net benefit to the public, and how and whether companies/industries subject to such government and regulatory mandates may or should behave. In short, commitment to anarchy is fine, but try to leave it at the door when making investment decisions.",2024-10-02
"@MWinMD The fossil fuel industry is not subsidized.  To the contrary, they page huge sums in taxes and other payments to governments at all levels.If the petroleum industry in the U.S. went away tomorrow a dozen states would see their economies collapse.  Many countries, too.",2024-10-02
"@Jeff Swan   The ecological impacts are commonly brought up but, $SGML is a Tier 1 producer with some of the lowest production costs in the world with zero carbon (100% renewable energy), zero waste water and using only recycled sewage grade water, no tailings ponds, pretty much as clean as it can possibly be.  More producers such as $ATLX will follow.  The most hazardous materials are down the supply chain from lithium mining anyway. Circularity continually increases.  This space is already an improvement over ICE pollution and will continue to improve with innovation now there is sufficient scale to justify the R&D.",2024-10-02
"@J Kimmel The economics of EVs is terrible.  Really inarguable.Hope you're not parking the car in the garage.  My insurance company won't cover fires started by EVs parked in my garage.Hope your battery doesn't die prematurely, as they are prone to do  Then, all you have a a 2 thousand pound paperweight.  You will have to pay someone to take the car away.However, if you are headed to coastal SC you will see intelligent use of EVs!  In Charleston, and on the islands.  In those places it makes great sense.  But then they are run on lead acid batteries.",2024-10-02

"@Reality Chacer Forcing taxpayers to pick up the tab for damage ONE energy source does that others would not, so that the first energy source can falsely POSE as ""cheap energy"" IS an implicit subsidy.  It's money taxpayers shell out to help that industry look like it sells its products at a better cost point.",2024-10-02
"@dstb Literally ICE vehicles contribute 30-40% to global emissions, EVs are inifitely better maintenance wise, eventually cost wise, driving wise, and climate wise. I'm not sure how you could possibly saying driving a Tesla Model 3 is not lightyears ahead of driving a totoya corolla. If you are saying that you are either intentionally lying or never driven an EV (no, a Bolt doesn't count).",2024-10-02
