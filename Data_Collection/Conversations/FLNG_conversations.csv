Compelling case for the industry but nada regarding FLNG's comparative merit vs. the competition in the sector.,2024-10-05
"@Charlot- 2020 $26.26 though it is not even a half position for me.  Not sure I trust any company that relies on 13 assets for their revenue.  Especially those that are basically floating bombs.As to my favorite, HAFN and Torm in my dividend portfolio and STNG in my total return portfolio.",2024-10-05
"@Charlot- 2020 I ended up using some of those funds to put towards other things I have been buying at the time: CNQ, DVN, EQT, IAUX, MU",2024-10-04
@atlasman Thank you. What was your purchase price on FNLG? And what is your prefered Tankers stock among the peers?,2024-10-04
"@Bulldog67 “FLNG has not covered its dividend for 7 consecutive quarters, and 8 out of the last 9 Q’s.”There’s a reason we’re yielding 12%TANSTAAFL",2024-10-04
I believe there was a lot of insider selling recently. It was enough to convince me to move on while I was at a slight profit on this one.,2024-10-04
"Robert,Good summary, but surprised you did not spend more time on the sustainability of FLNG’s dividend.Clearly if one adds back depreciation, the cash flows are sufficient to pay the dividend.  But as you know, eventually any company has to spend money to replace worn out plant and equipment (LNG ships in this case).FLNG has not covered its dividend for 7 consecutive quarters, and 8 out of the last 9 Q’s.  Now does that mean they will cut the dividend in the near future?  Of course not!  However, anyone owning FLNG needs to understand that the company has been refi’ing debt on their various ships to take capital out.  That excess capital has been used to maintain the dividend.Positives:  good fleet contract coverage and no debt maturing before 2028.John Fredriksen owns 43.4% of FLNG;  he loves dividends; and doesn’t mind borrowing $$ to pay them.  Note Seadrill.While the 2Q earnings were the low point due to two ships in dry dock, it is interesting to note that interest costs in the last quarter consumed 30.7 cents of every revenue dollar!  That is high!I have successfully traded FLNG over the past several years, but am currently out of the stock.  Any investor needs to understand that this is a high risk yield play!  Safe for now, but better hope that ships continue to get contracted at good rates.GLTA!",2024-10-04
"FLNG was my latest tanker purchase.  I held off on it for so long because I viewed it expensive compared with their peers with an EV/EBITDA > 10 which is twice my other tankers (ASC, TRMD, HAFN, STNG, and TNK) mainly due to their relatively high debt load (NET Debt/EBITDA ~5).  However, they are extremely profitable and can sustain their 11% dividend which recently includes 7.3% debt pay down yield which hopefully will turn in to real RoC sometime in the future.",2024-10-04
I just researched JOLCOs and they are apparently lease to own financing deals typically for aircraft.  Does this mean FLNG will be selling this freighter?Is it callable by the lessee?,2024-10-03
If this results in any meaningful pullback in stock price an opportunity is at hand.  Will monitor price action for possible buy entry points.  Long FLNG,2024-10-02
"@PapaWhisky More likely, renewing $FLNG's October 1, 2021 shelf filing on its three-year expiration. Here's the prior shelf registration:www.sec.gov/... (dated October 1, 2021)_____What Is a Shelf Offering?A shelf offering is a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provision that allows an equity issuer (such as a corporation) to register a new issue of securities without having to sell the entire issue at once. The issuer can instead sell portions of the issue over a three-year period without re-registering the security or incurring penalties.www.investopedia.com/... (emphasis added)",2024-10-02
"@Nikolaos Sismanis I agree with you that a dividend cut is not a near term possibility.  FLNG will continue to refi-debt to create more cash to help pay the dividend.  Given the forward contracts of their fleet, I would expect the crap to hit the fan about 2 years from now.However, I don’t like owning any stock that is consistently not covering their dividend.  Because if (when) they do cut, the stock will hit an air pocket.  There are just too many other good income opportunities where the company’s dividend is well covered.  So IMHO, why play with fire!",2024-09-24
"@Bulldog67 I have to agree with you. I certainly painted a somewhat more optimistic picture in that regard. I guess it's because I don't think they will be cutting the dividend at least through 2028, making this a ""bond-like"" investment. Also, derivatives are non-cash, so there is some room for them. It's certainly a riskier situation that this conveyed, though. Thank you for contributing!",2024-09-23
@Bulldog67 Agreed.  One rate cut isn't going to dramatically improve their div coverage.  There's time to wait on this one.,2024-09-20
"@Nikolaos Sismanis While I agree with you that the 2Q was likely the low EPS quarter of the year due to dry docking of two ships, you paint a too rosy picture of FLNG's dividend coverage.  Listed below is a comparison of FLNG's FD EPS and DPS over the past 11 Q's (almost three years):Quarter .......... FD EPS............Div. Paid (includes extras)2Q24 ............. 0.40 .................  0.751Q24 ............. 0.62 .................  0.754Q23 ............. 0.36 .................  0.753Q23 ............. 0.84 .................  0.8752Q23 ............. 0.72 ................   0.751Q23 ............. 0.31 ................   0.754Q22 ............. 0.77 ................   1.003Q22 ............. 0.87 ................   0.752Q22 ............. 0.83 ................   1.251Q22 ............. 1.05 ................   0.754Q21 ............. 1.30 ................   0.75Now the quarterly FD earnings shown above include gains and losses on derivatives.  However, those gains and losses are real (whether they should be ""marked to market"" each quarter according to GAAP is another argument), and they helped reported earnings in several of the Q's.So bottom line, FLNG has NOT covered it's dividend in any of the past 7 Q's, nor in 8 of the past 9 Q's.  As you point out, management has refinanced loans on certain ships, which has freed up cash.  That additional cash has been used to fund part of the dividends each quarter.Remember that John Fredriksen is a major shareholder, and thru his ownership of Geveran Trading Company owns 43.4%.  Mr. Fredriksen loves dividends and does not mind taking on debt to pay them.  ""Google"" Seadrill for an example.Lastly, in the most recent quarter, FLNG's net interest expense consumed 30.7 cents of every revenue dollar!  Now if revs pick back up, that # will drop, but it still represents a very high cost of debt!So bottom line:  FLNG is a high risk yield play.  Their forward contracted fleet is a positive, as well as not having any debt maturities prior to 2028.  However, there is NO WAY one can claim that their dividend is well covered as your article certainly insinuates.",2024-09-12
Div coverage looked shaky last I checked.  Sold it and bought lpg earlier in the year.,2024-09-11
"Thanks for this article. I own both FLNG and CLCO, and I'm hoping for better times for both as interest rates decline. But the juicy dividends these two pay have made it much easier to absorb the declines in their stock prices over the past several months. It's encouraging to know that you think their dividends are safe for now.",2024-09-10

"I hesitate to purchase a company that relies on only 13 boats for the business.  One goes down for any reason and you lose 8% of your business.  Also, their debt load is very high and will absorb a fair amount of FCF over the next few years.",2024-09-09
