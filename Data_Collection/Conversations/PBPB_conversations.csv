"430 stores built in 40 years. Now they're gonna build 1,600 more?I remember my last meal at Potbelly's 10 years ago on the Tollway in Dallas, Texas. I thought, ""How sad and tired this customer experience is. Firehouse Subs left this place in the rearview covered in dust. WTH happened?""That said, a 500 SF store is interesting. Would that be drive thru only?",2024-10-06
"One of the only places I go for quick serve food. Always high-quality food and good variety. That being said, their prices are getting a lot higher. Family of four is going to pay over $50 for a sandwich, chips and a drink. Easy to see why store traffic could decline in the future.",2024-09-10
