"@rondayvous2 It is not enough to be sustainable, we have to compete for best sustainable and economical ways to harness renewables.Tax subsidies are not sustainable.Get real! Enphase is the least competitive . yet kept alive on the death bed with tubes  injected into arms from government subsidiesx.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@Adam Lyons I like the idea, every time we have a power outage and my neighbors generators kick in, the racket is more than a little annoying. Batteries have already come down a lot and aren't that far away from being comparable to the cost of putting a generator in. As for the DC chargers, still don't see the need, unless they come out with a low voltage system that you can run off your solar charged batteries and that seems like a pretty limited use situation.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"ARRY has the highest Piotroski Score in the sectorA score of 7( fwiw, NVDA has a score of 6 )The Piotroski Score was devised by Professor of Accounting at Stanford, Joseph D. Piotroski.For every criteria below met, a stock is awarded one point. The points are then added up to determine the value of the stock, with Nine being the highest and Zero being the lowest.Positive Net IncomePositive return on assets in the current yearPositive operating cash flow in the current yearCash flow from operations being greater than net IncomeLower ratio of long term debt in the current period, compared to the previous yearHigher current ratio this year compared to the previous yearNo new shares were issued in the last yearA higher gross margin compared to the previous yearA higher asset turnover ratio compared to the previous yearThis stuff matters the most at the end of the day.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000
"@JR Research:  I hope so.  But as a homeowner who doesn't like newer homes and the prices, build issues, HOA issues, etc. -- when the storms come and the lines are down -- you're in the dark with your food spoiling, no heat or AC, no cooking, etc. unless you have your own solar and/or battery system (preferably both for long outages). It would be nice if we'd just bite the bullet and bury ALL the lines on a schedule (lots of jobs, etc), but I don't see us paying for that when we won't pay our bills already, re the massive ongoing deficits.",2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
"@theunintelligent-investor:  So people that want a battery and solar panels couldn't use an Enphase Solar system and a non-Enphase battery?  I have friends who are adding a Powerwall 3 to an existing solar system locally by a professional installer, and I'm pretty sure the solar system is NOT from Tesla, but I'd need to confirm.  They didn't want to do both at once, but like me, they wanted more independence re power, especially during outages, plus burning less fossil fuels (it's all coal and gas around here, re the utilities.  Certainly the profits would be bigger if people choose a whole Enphase solar plus battery system, but I don't see Tesla ruining Enphase unless they end up with a battery system in a class by itself and at a low price.  (And even as a long term TSLA long, I don't expect that -- just that Tesla is serious about battery backup systems, and growing volumes over time).",2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
"Now lets compare and contrast NXT with ARRY i preface this with the fact that i like NXT but right now ARRY is also outperforming them and NXT saw a huge increase in shares outstanding last year and a quarter over quarter revenue decline so : Valuation RatiosARRY has a market cap or net worth of $966.25 million. The enterprise value is $1.77 billion.ARRY The trailing PE ratio is 61.09 and the forward PE ratio is 8.17.

"@Nick from Canada maybe if our government double or triple tax subsidies to First Solar, then the locals may change their minds about being too stubbornly loyal to our domestic fossil industry.  Our government can take tax credits away from expensive rooftops and give to First Solar.. There is still one glitch,   where do  First Solar get more tellurium in the future? Tellurium is a rare earth metal.There is a tiny tellurium exploratioin company with two depoists here in North America including one in the B.C. They moves too slowly and I wonder if First Solar will run out of tellurium before the tiny company start developing the mines.Biden is blocking fossil developments then give very little to First Solar which makes very little sense ot me.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@Nick from Canada First Solar is the biggest but many locals are against solar farms . First Solar doesnt  make solar panels for rooftops..  just solar farms.  many locals are loyal to oil companies so they favor gensets over solar farms .. you can buy Generac . Amercians are not focused on renewables as much as you may think. They still prefer to support domestic fossil industry here.  so what better way to do so by buying gensets that use diesel, NG or gasoline  instead of soaking in sunshine . Even renewable guys hate solar farms .First Solar is oddly siilent about future tellurium supplies that is critical to making solar panels that are made of cadmium telluride.   instead of silicon crystalline which is most common and can be used on rooftops.Rooftops are very expensive  because of high labor costs  and time consuming installations, but our government still give tax credits to rooftop customers and very little to First Solar.",2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
@OilIsDEAD which Solar stocks do you recommend? First Solar? I’d like to buy a US-based solar stock but I’m not sure which ones are making strides in the industry.,2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@rondayvous2 Exactly, we're in the very early innings. The idea would be that in the next ten years, solar and batteries get a lot better and continue to grow. So someone starts making affordable DC chargers. But it might be quite a few years from now.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
Enphase is actually a very small solar stock if you stil call it as such which it was never been a solar stock. it is just a electronic stock that happens to work with solar panels. Enphase doesnt contribute much to the growth of renewable energy needed to cut down fossil production .  I know traders dont care but I am talking to others who mistakenly thought that Enphase is a solar energy stock which they are really not!Dump Enphase!,2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
Enphase is a midget in comparsion to First Solar.. Enphase is nothing but a highly profitable ripoff that are still enabled by our government and high utiltiy rates. Enphase cannot survive without high utility rates.First Solar compete on price of wholesale electricity.. not Enphase.. Enphase rely totally on highest utility electriicty rates .,2024-09-29 00:00:00.000000
"@Rossum You can buy a DC charger for home use, but they're designed to charge exceptionally fast (faster than most homes can support), and are very expensive. Most readily available and affordable chargers are AC. But DC chargers will come, as this is still an extremely young space. The years to come will feature extremely quick advances.",2024-09-27 00:00:00.000000
"@Rossum re "" I'll consider an EV for local use once I can get one with an LFP battery that supports bi-directional charging.""Why do you need it to have LFP, if is primarily for emergency V2H backup power, which is a very rare event? It seems to make more sense to have an NMC/NCA battery to get much longer driving range, and maximum V2H especially in dangerous weather situations like hurricanes, wildfires, storms, etc., which can be expected and planned (fully charged) for ahead of time.  That said, already the Ford F150 lightning has V2H and will get LFPs by next year.fordauthority.com/...The 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning will receive a new LFP battery pack at some point during its production run, which is expected to be optional on the Pro and XLT trims, with the current NICM unit standard range battery serving as the standard option. When that happens, the F-150 Lightning will join the Ford Mustang Mach-E as the second Blue Oval model to be available with an LFP battery pack, as the EV crossover gained that option for standard range models earlier this year.Some electric vehicles (EVs) with bidirectional charging include:Ford F-150 Lightning: Supports V2G, V2H, and V2V chargingGenesis GV60: Supports V2L chargingGenesis GV70: Supports V2L chargingGenesis GV80: Supports V2L chargingHyundai Ioniq 5: Supports V2L chargingHyundai Ioniq 6: Supports V2L chargingKia EV6: Supports V2L chargingKia EV9: Supports V2G, V2H, and V2L chargingKia Niro: Supports V2L chargingLucid Air: Supports V2V chargingMitsubishi Outlander PHEV: Supports V2L chargingNissan Leaf: Supports V2H and V2G chargingTesla Cybertruck: Supports V2H and V2L chargingVolkswagen ID.4: Supports V2H charging",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"@gnwilliams Rooftop customers typically have no idea how much a single solar panel produce a hour in terms of money..  a 500 watt panel produce about 20 cents worth of electricty a hour.  It is hard to justify investing $1000 on every single solar panel on average for rooftops. If we spent more than we should, this mean that we are much slower on our goal toward climate change. Frist Solar probalby cost $200 or so per solar panel on average in a solar farm and this includes free recycling .. First Solar competes with other sources of energy on wholesale prices .  If First Solar compete based on utility rates we pay, First solar would be most profitable solar stock!",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000

"@Rossum For emergency use this is a huge positive use case for an EV! And it's part of my thesis: batteries, in your car or in your house, will be becoming more and more popular every year. Hybrid string inverters for solar do better with batteries. Whether your residential battery or charging your car off solar directly!",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"@Aricool I've said I'll consider an EV for local use once I can get one with an LFP battery that supports bi-directional charging.   I don't care about V2G, but an extra 50-75 kWh of storage for V2H would dramatically increase the value proposition of such a vehicle to me in a power outage.   I already have solar and some battery capacity, but the batts aren't even close to big enough to ride out a lengthy power outage without a generator.",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
@Seeburto Same here. Battery technology is improving all the time. Five years from now I expect to see higher capacity with lower weight and lower prices. Samsung's new battery tech in particular seems very promising.,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
