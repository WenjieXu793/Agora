@Brad Toland Productively?  I don't think so.  The money will be used to make greener steel.  Green steel that the other steel makers already provide.  The CAPEX needed to produce green steel is redundant not productive.  When CLF is done updating the blast furnaces and pellet plants the company will still produce the same amount of steel just in a less carbon intensive way.  This is why the share price lags behind the rest of the industry.  It is why US Steel is selling.  The money needed to update facilities puts CLF at the bottom of the steel industry.  Don't believe me look at the multiples of the other steel producers.  CLF has a lot of work ahead of it.  The share price will languish for a long time.,2024-10-08 11:31:06.729931
@hootie123987 deploying that money productively is fine by me. Best regards,2024-10-08 11:31:06.729931
@hootie123987 CLF will have a major carbon reduction agenda in the near future.  Probably why the stock price is languishing when compared to electronic arc steel makers.,2024-10-08 11:31:06.729931
@Brad Toland Too bad the cash will be needed to reline the BOF's and convert them to hydrogen.  How many does CLF own? 5-6 plants.  Think a billion or so apiece.  Plus all pellet plants will need to be converted to DRI pellet plants.  About a billion a piece for that at 5 or so mines.,2024-10-08 11:31:06.729931
"What do you pay today for a company that is throwing off a billion in free cash flow and may, in the future, throw off 2 billion per year for the next 15 years?Best regards,Bt",2024-10-08 11:31:06.729931

"@PEAK AUTOS I would bet that Chinese cars made from Chinese steel either weight more or are less strong that their counterparts made in the USA using CLF's automotive steel - it's a special high strength lightweight steel and not cheap compared to regular sheet metal. ArcelorMittal patented at least one special type of automotive steel and licensed it to AKS, which CLFs bought - so if China is using that type of steel they're stealing AM's IP.",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@sts66 Sounds reasonable to me!  I'm confident we'll see high CLF prices again, but the circumstances will probably be different.   That's where I get into trouble.  ""Steel prices are going up, profits will rise next quarter..."", everything looks good and getting better, and then something unexpected happens.  As you said, LG loves his empire building, and he's okay taking down the share price while he does it.  GL to all.",2024-09-29 00:00:00.000000

"@mbrune If CLF hits $22 again I'm out for good - will make 140% in profits and won't care that I could have gotten a lot more if I had sold at $30+ - just can't stand what LG is doing building an empire with the highest cost structure/lowest margins in the industry, primarily due to unions the LG oddly loves to coddle.",2024-09-27 00:00:00.000000
"@G065X ""tripled down today. Bottom is in...next run for infrastructure development will drive need for commodities""I'm not so sure the bottom is in for CLF. Some thought the bottom was in for CLF when it declined from around $33 to around $15 in 2022. While it had some bounces since that $15 price, it never got back up to $33, and is still below $15. Imo the bounce now in CLF is just a bounce. The stock might still get down to $9 or less within the next several months.",2024-09-27 00:00:00.000000

"@Nathan5 Capri is not huge either.And there's plenty of other fashion makers even after a Capri/Tapestry merger. The FTC doesn't care. They could well delay stelco for a while, if not block it altogether.",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"@Only Dividend good for you. Sounds like intelligent trading. By your comment about the next recession, well it was expected many years ago. But it will happen and if you can time your trades accordingly good call.",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
@bessaff I have been in a out of CLF. It has made moves to <$9 many times over the last 5 years. During the next recession I expect it to happen again. I will buy low and sell high. Rinse and repeat with this volatile stock. Generally an easy double if you set limits as it can rise and fall very quickly.,2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"@beach_trader You are correct in your thinking. I will personalize the rest to make my point.....Around 2015/2016 I had some major losses from blown investments (not options) where my naivety got the better of me when I was not well versed in risks associated with likes of LINN/CBL and I carried huge tax loss carry forwards.Next came some solid gains booked via much appreciated stocks with sizable positions (HUN, for example) and it was without tax consequences. It did not matter how those profits were generated.....short/long term......All this happened over a period of a few years.",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"@stock realist stelco is not big enough to be held up; but X maybe yeah. Regardless, even China's current production will come back in line with supply& demand- that's what commodity trading is all about. CLF has a rosy future; should get a boost if Trump wins. Long CLF",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"@beach_trader that is the way I have always understood it.“Short-term capital gains are profits realized from the sale of personal or investment property that has been held for one year or less. These gains are taxed as ordinary income, which is your personal income tax rate (typically between 10% and 37%).”",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"@nkvbradenton ok, but option selling in taxable account is short term capital gain that can be offset by short term capital losses and net winds up getting treated as ordinary income. If you don't want to engage as tax attorney, I don't get it, that's fine, but other investors should not get the impression that it doesn't get very poor tax treatment",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
"@beach_trader Allow me to chime in here. I don't think you have full understanding of someone's personal financial situation. I want to refrain from disclosing anything further respecting some boundaries on personal conduct. I will also say that while totally understanding your stated stance to not engage in options trading, even while you are well versed in the craft from your former work experience, I have quite decent outcomes in put selling activity. Yes, there are risks of blown trades if indulging in selling puts on ""iffy"" tickers which are destined to massively underperform, if not face eventual bankruptcy. It requires one to stay disciplined with total at risk and which companies to take risk on. With the way stocks of some solid companies get whipsawed on headlines, it opens up opportunities to trade. Doing it judiciously......to lessen pain, if wrong....the prerequisite.",2024-09-24 00:00:00.000000
