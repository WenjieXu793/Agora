"What distinguishes APD from its competitors is its enormous and prescient investment in the expansion of its global leadership position in the production of hydrogen  to include both blue and, more importantly, green avenues as well as its their conversion to ammonia for maritime transport.  These multi-year projects consume huge amounts of capital. Neon (https://www.neom.com/en-us) is emblematic.The transcript of its recent presentation at the Jefferies Industrials Conference is instructive(seekingalpha.com/...).  It is a wide ranging discussion that touches on the recently announced multi-year transition process to replace its current extraordinary CEO Seifi Ghasemi.",2024-10-04
"@New Adams APD has certainly been stuck in recent years. I think sentiment will turn around in the next couple of years. Once the NEOM project is placed into service by the end of calendar year 2026, I foresee that being the catalyst to help shares regain momentum.",2024-10-04

"I think they got their footing again.  Some of the issue was that people misinterpreted the cost changes in some projects.  Announcing more was taken as spiraling costs when it was just building a bigger plant.Quarter 4 is usually the best.  And then the last of this crappy 2 cent more dividend.  Hope we see a nice one, next.",2024-10-03
"This stock seems to be forever stuck in the under-300 category, unlike LIN which has been climbing forever to new highs. Don't know what will change the dynamic.",2024-10-03
@sorangi Actually Ghasemi was taken to task by the bankers and analysts for spending so many billions on green and blue H w/o offtake agreements in place.  He argued that the price would keep going up and that waiting would be more profitable.  All those concerns were laid to rest by the TTE deal.,2024-09-10
"@jarratta No. I read that Air products and chemicals only invests with such long term agreements, which indeed supported my confidence in Air Products and Chemicals, despite some technical doubts about hydrogen technology.",2024-09-10
@sorangi Have you examined the metrics of the 15yr TTE offtake agreement?,2024-09-10
