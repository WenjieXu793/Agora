@Bill the Bag Man agree.  At a macro level the weekly summary that would be somewhat useful would be the number of companies that reported positive earnings growth or revenue growth net inflation.  Of which I think only CCL did.  Would need to check.  But otherwise not a very helpful metric.,2024-10-05
Do companies ever really guide earnings very high? No. They guide on the conservative cautious side. Usually that is why an equity tanks if they miss or guide lower. Nothing earth shattering and it is not saying much about the macro economic picture.,2024-10-05
I want to love this stock as much as you and Jim Cramer do. I really do. But MKC trades at an incredibly high p/e for a stock that has gone nowhere in the past five years.,2024-10-02

"With a .76 beta, it is a great hiding place when the market is volatile.  Of course, now that rates are falling, it might not been such a great place to be.  I have some and it may be a source of funds on my next trade.",2024-09-18
