"@recurring_rev i haven't seen a definite revenue number, some back of the napkin analysis ive seen on linkedin imply a revenue range of $14-$25m.  I would assume that as the spend category became mature in the past few years with brex/ramp/divvy et. al. that their customer acquisiton process at airbase became very expensive.  I would assume that paylocity would turbocharge this and you'd see some synergies and margin improvements in this business of the next couple of years.",2024-09-06
@recurring_rev Just saw the Airbase revenue number ~ $5M. very high multiples. Also worried they have 300 employees and with that kind of revenue number.,2024-09-04
Brilliant move. More products with high margins to sell to existing customers.,2024-09-04
This might be me just complaining - but no explainer at all about what Airbase is? I kind of expect to at least have 1-2 sentences here giving me an overview..,2024-09-04

"@Valuation Focus Thanks for your kind comment. Don't have any particular insights with respect to work place culture other than what is available from sites like Glassdoor. Paylocity has a higher score compared to Paycom overall, and also a higher percentage saying they would recommend working for the company to a friend, so it seems the work culture is better.With respect to buyback decisions, it is difficult to know how the Board decides, but it is one of the few companies we have seen to put out a public target that they plan to keep SBC below x% of revenues. We might have missed them, but we could not find news or press releases about repurchases for Paylocity in the 2020-2023 period when shares were trading at high prices, so the Board maybe did consider the valuation when making the decision for the recent stock repurchase program.",2024-08-28
