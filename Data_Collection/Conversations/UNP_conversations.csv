"Do you think the Longshoremen's strike on Sept 1 would cause a spike in the rail stocks?  Thought is that goods that have been shipped to alternative ports in LA, etc will have to get to final destinations by rail",2024-09-30
"Thanks for the article, Leo, always appreciate your insights and opinions.But like others in the comments here, I find $UNP to be pretty fully valued, maybe even a bit overvalued here. Historically, UNP just does not trade over 20 PE for extended periods of time the way it has for the last few years.I'm sorry but at 20+ PE, UNP is priced to perfection here with no room for error. At some point earnings and price will converge at a more reasonable and lower PE.  I appreciate Mr. Vena's efforts in improving operating margins and efficiencies, but what with funding buybacks with debt while revenues have stagnated, at a certain point there's only so much juice that can be squeezed.I made the difficult decision to sell out of my entire position over the past month with my gains intact. I used most of that money to add to my $GOOGL position. I just couldn't justify holding both my UNP and GOOGL positions with both trading at virtually the same PE, with Google having far greater and faster growth ahead, while also buying back shares with cash rather than debt.",2024-09-28
@usiah The quarterly dividend was increased from $1.30 to $1.34 last July.  It should be arriving in our accounts on 30th September. I'm another investor who intends to hold Union Pacific forever (along with Canadian Pacific),2024-09-28
Looks about 10-15% overvalued to me. It will eventually revert to its normal PE range.,2024-09-28
"@usiah I don't mind that, as UNP has always taken care of its shareholders. It's a cyclical business. They are careful when headwinds are mounting.",2024-09-28
"Have been holding UNP (several years) as a dividend-growth vehicle, which, like my other holdings, I bought with the intention never to sell (assuming, of course, that it stays fundamentally sound and continues acceptable dividend growth). Nine quarters without a raise is for me an alert.Retired dividend-growth investor",2024-09-27
@Long Time Running They have done a great job balancing debt and buybacks imo,2024-09-27
@ndardick No. Russia does not have these capabilities. They cannot even achieve a successful ground war on their own land.,2024-09-27
"@Leo Nelissen I hate to rub salt in the wound, but weren't you 100% certain that the Fed would only cut interest rates by 25 BPS? I am proud of you for having a high conviction when you take a stand on something important. But, isn't there a chance that a conflagration between Iran and Israel could bring both Russia and the United States into the war?",2024-09-27
"UNP adding $4.5 billion to their debt over the next few years  for share repurchases....gotta Ike that investment thesis.When interest rates are low and you can beat the market on returns, reward your shareholders.",2024-09-27
"I understand your long term commitment to a panoply of railroads, but I think that UNP and the rest of this sector is now fully and fairly priced, and I expect prices of these railroads to go chug chug rather than choo choo over the next year. Longer term, price targets of $270 and $290 are certainly feasible. In the interim, the p/e ratio and dividend yield of UNP is reasonable. And we know that railroads are irreplaceable and will never go out of business. I might be more interested now except for the following factors:1. My older (much older) age.2. My commitment to reap what I have sowed, and harvest gains rather than plant new seeds in my investment garden.I could be totally wrong as the two largest economies in the World are adding economic stimulus.Have a great weekend, Leo. I hope that WW III does not escalate before the stock market opens on Monday. I am presently as un-leveraged as I recall being for years in light of geopolitical concerns more than macroeconomic concerns, and because the U. S. Presidential election (in which I hope to avoid a sweep by either party) scheduled to take place less than 40 days from now is a wild card.",2024-09-27
"Agreed. Seems priced to perfection here at 20+ PE, lots of optimistic assumptions baked into the price with little room for error.Historically $UNP doesn't trade over 20 PE for extended periods of time like this.Still currently long but I've sold over half my position these last few weeks.",2024-09-15
"Holding, bought last year when Vena became CEO, ~18% up.  I think there is a lot of room for operational improvements which Vena will capitalize on.  He will also restructure and delayer management pushing down decision making.  He will close some switching yards, promote customer blocking, longer trains, bypass terminals, stronger ancillary charges for customer delays etc.  To bolster the balance sheet, sell some excess or surplus properties to reduce debt, retire or mothball excess coal trackage including second or third mains in Wyoming.  He will push marketing and sales to build new markets and rates to cost + inflation.  Bottom line, I see debt levels improving, a more streamlined operation which should improve service and redeploy capital to  bring on more growth in select markets. Inflation is coming down, interest rates are coming down, could miss a recession.  Regardless, long term hold.",2024-09-13
"I believe that UNP is due to declare yet another 2-1 stock split before too long, which will jump start the stock as it has done in the past.",2024-09-13
"agree, good analysis. better entry point ahead. what price does UNP become interesting you? almost every stock is overpriced based on the next recession.",2024-09-13
