"@Randol33 no doubt, but I have become a huge believer in the strength of correct end-markets. I followed two stocks and one has languished for years while the other continues to skyrocket because one chose surgical and genomics end market for 50% of their business and the other chose more mass market industrial for 100% of their business - like removing paint off ships, some EV production, etc.. Specialized niche products that have regulatory capture seem to do a little better. Think of a jet engine part. Do you think anyone will be allowed to certify and make that?",2024-08-27
@bluescorpion0 Hard to gauge how much it is reflected in the share price since we are in a very extended bull market. When the market turns down will tell the tail of how much investors are pricing in the future of TDY.,2024-08-27
