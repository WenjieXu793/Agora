It appears there is quite a lot of bullish sentiment for NFLX. $900 per share is doable but how long will that be reached?,2024-10-05
"@Hudson Investments It seems like everything on TV would be inconsistent with MAGA  values since there is nothing they like, including America itself. You may be right. We’ll see when they report earnings on the 17th.",2024-10-04
"@Damon Judd There will be an upside to NFLX, when and how long depends on SUB acquisition leading to increased income by way of revenues.",2024-10-04
This sounds like a good ide that will open content up to new people.,2024-10-04
It sounds to me like a money grab from NFLX.,2024-10-04
It’s a bad idea for a poor country to saddle costs on streaming of creative material just to make a “buck”. I do not think it will hurt Netflix on a grand scale. Perhaps just a little though I do not know the numbers involve using these taxed companies.,2024-10-04
@SuperPac NFLX et al will just raise prices to compensate. That will knock out lower end customers but then NFLX et al can ratchet back on the content they make for those regions so it still pencils out. They can ramp up production of content for more lucrative regions.The big streaming winners like NFLX and DIS will still be winners. They'll just adjust their businesses to hostile environments. China has never let them in at all. That hasn't prevented their overall success.,2024-10-03
"@ptusr I do not know Ackman’s position, but he must have bought NFLX wrong to bail on the stock. I believe that NFLX will be higher in the near term and am betting on it to win.",2024-10-03
@Henrik Alex $220 to $700 +.... Looks like $NFLX outperformed the market by a wee tad ; )  @Analyze This,2024-10-03
"@SuperPac - It's going to be interesting to see how they try and implement this.  For NFLX and DIS it's easy.  It's VAT and just added to the bill / passed on to the customer with almost no impact to the companies at all unless it impacts the demand price point.For search engines, mobile apps, and gaming... that is going to be harder as, in most cases, there is not a bill for the customer to pay.  They are just exploiting your data and advertising to you.   I'd like to see how they're going to VAT that...",2024-10-02
"Good move. Let's hope other nations in Asia and Africa follow suit, if they haven't already. In fact, impose higher rates on $NFLX et al. 12% seems a bit low. I would say, try a rate b/w 18% and 25%. If $NFLX wish to leave, open the gates wide for them.",2024-10-02
"@ISTJ Investor Hastings and co-CEO Ted Sarandos at one point were interested in buying a big studio to solidify Netflix's presence in Hollywood, but didn't want the associated declining linear businesses, said a person familiar with Sarandos' thinking. Netflix has explored Paramount for its studio business. It looked at MGM before Amazon bought it for an eye-popping $8.5 billion. There were conversations about buying a Korean studio, a knowledgeable source said. (Netflix ended up doing a partnership in 2019 with that company, Studio Dragon, and its parent CJ ENM.)Then there's the question of whether Netflix could really go big in video games, which have newly demonstrated their potential to translate to scripted TV and film hits (see: ""The Last of Us,"" ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie""). If Microsoft succeeds in its $69 billion bid for Activision Blizzard, Netflix could look no further than Epic Games, whose Fortnite game Hastings has held up as the streamer's biggest competitor for eyeballs outside of TVhttp://archive.today/nVTuC",2024-10-01
@LenceFlatu I am long NFLX and I rate it a BUY with a $800 target.,2024-09-30
@nerd_rage I totally agree that ad supported membership of NFLX will bring is a steady stream of new subs. Many new customers will never join due to cost factors as you say. Others are sharing passwords and have been caught by astute technology. These subs will pay the fees to get off the stealing of services due to password sharing. Bottom line this will bring in additional revenues to Netflix.,2024-09-30
"@TheMadMariner I'm not sure I'd go quite that far, although I agree it's unlikely to become the gusher of cash that Disney World is. Netflix is experimenting, much as it has always done, and the novelty of it should yield at least a certain amount of consumer interest, I would think.These are mostly rented facilities, not owned, so if Netflix finds it isn't working it can shut down without too much loss. But there is evidence that consumer fandom enjoys having places like this to go to.",2024-09-30
@Natturner1966 75% of NFLX subscribers are overseas. Why do they care about American domestic politics?,2024-09-30
"@ISTJ Investor I'm curious too. What company could NFLX buy that would do anything for them they can't do for themselves? Something about AI perhaps? I keep thinking that the next big disruption is when people start making and sharing their own pretty good looking AI productions, filching big IP to do so. Let's remake Game of Thrones' final season. Let's see the unwoke version of The Acolyte. NFLX IP could also become a target of this. All the IP owners need to be thinking, how do I manage this without letting YouTube make all the money and I have to spend money siccing copyright lawyers on the whole world?",2024-09-30
"@Max Greve NFLX competes with YouTube and Facebook for advertiser budgets, competitors whose eyeballs number in the billions. Even NFLX is a bit small potatoes by comparison but at least they can boast well over a quarter billion pairs of eyeballs.",2024-09-30
"@Hudson Investments An ad blocker will help with that.My hunch about streaming is that it's 70/30 in favor of ads or will settle into that range when it all shakes out. Remember the growth now is in Asia, with low ARPU. Ads are a good way to reach a lower income audience without jacking up prices too severely.",2024-09-30
"@Max Greve NFLX works with creatives from all over the world, including those who are eager to get their content in front of 277M subscribers. Creatives have relatively little power vs NFLX as the number of wannabe creators swells and the distribution opportunities contract (well I'm not counting social media or YouTube).",2024-09-30
