It will be interesting to see HUM stock after earning report.,2024-10-06
@The ROE Rocketeer I don't have a stance on PBM and don't own a healthcare stock. My point is that if you dig deep enough on almost any industry and you'll probably not like what you see.,2024-10-06
"@ckarabin It doesn't seem to be especially favorable for the provider either, especially in CVS' case. Maybe 2025 rebidding will change that. Good for investors, maybe not so much for customers.",2024-10-06
@The ROE Rocketeer That's terrific that you're 22 and are already on your investing journey. You'll have the power of compounding working for you for decades to come. Best of luck to you!,2024-10-05
"@Citrtan None, I’m still very early in my investment journey, and since I’m only 22 years old, I prefer to focus on quality stocks and concentrate on my convictions. I truly believe this is the best way to kickstart the compounding effect as quickly as possible.For instance, I’m currently holding two stocks: AVG, which is my largest position with around 2,500 shares, and Uber. These are high-quality stocks with growing secular trends, so I trade around my core positions by selling puts and covered calls. Given their high implied volatility, the premiums are expensive, which I like.—- (edit)Healthcare is shady industry, so I’m just really observing from distant at this point. This channel is very informative, so I recommend it to all here: youtu.be/...",2024-10-05
"@pdrozin let me tell you another reason why you’re having trouble with this stock. Aetna has made a practice of forcing retired workers union members in municipalities, into their Medicare advantage plan. You heard me rightIn 2021 they went to move 250,000 retired, disabled, and 911 responders from New York City into the Aetna Medicare advantage plan.  We fought back to stay on our traditional Medicare.Medicare advantage is not Medicare and it’s not an advantage.You’re in it for a stock. Insurance for me saves my life. If you create a barrier to my doctor, we have a problem. Many of our doctors and hospitals would not accept this plan, and it is riddled with prior authorization that makes the insurance company the gatekeeper between me and the treatment. My doctor wants to give me.You can make all the profits you want, but it’s not gonna be off my lifeThat’s What you’re investing in.A company that is literally making money for shareholders by forcing people off Medicare and into their managed healthcare plan in which many of their doctors and hospitals don’t accept. And in which they are the final determinant or require you to go through five levels of appeals before the treatment your doctor wants to give you is received.The New York City organization of public service retirees. We have been fighting this for three years.Aetna has an arm that specifically goes after municipalities to convert their retired workers into their healthcare plan so you could make a dime",2024-10-05
"These Medicare Advantage plans really put the customer on the short end. If their costs go up, you find that your ""contract"" with them was written in invisible ink as they can change the benefits at will or raise price at the next year's start and you really don't have a choice but to pay. When you buy Medicare advantage, what have you really bought but a policy that is open ended for the provider.",2024-10-05
"I sold at $95 and have been watching since.  Where to begin with his company? Aetna profit pressure. Grossly overpaying for the two primary care practices. PBM business under fire from Congress. Pharmacists ill-treated by management. Failure to  more aggressively pay down debt as they had promised. Karen Lynch seems imperious and to have no credibility. Always yapping about some grand synergistic future, where it all comes together. She seems to move the goalposts with every quarterly meeting.  I wish everybody well, but I don't have the confidence to come back in.",2024-10-05
"@Tyreswat Yes, similar cost basis as well, but very slow money at best.",2024-10-05
@pdrozin same here. Stop loss and no risk in this underperforming asset. Have a cost under 50$ but it looks like dead money the next years. Greetings from Germany,2024-10-04
@Herbert +H-Dog+ Kornfeld Someone has to pay the cost. Any time you buy something you're fighting with the supplier for how much you pay.,2024-10-04
"""TD Cowen upgraded CVS Health to Buy...  analyst Charles Rhyee argued that CVS has meaningfully cut over-the-counter benefits across its plans""Unreal how the US health-care system pits providers against patients",2024-10-04
"@Jlexus1953 Agreed, the profit return is little more than chicken scratch - but I think you meant ""paltry"".",2024-10-04
@Always Bullish check today’s price. Mr Market is giving CVS lots of love. Glad I didnt sell when you said to do so.,2024-10-04
Just close my position after 3 years of investment with a reasonable profit including dividends.While CVS provides a nice dividend the company profit return on revenue is poultry.Moreover management got caught unsuspected as benefits from Medicare surged after pandemic.,2024-10-04
"Seems like they will see an earnings boost from the closure of all the Rite Aids nationwide. Not sure how many RA are closing nationwide (800-ish?), but here in Michigan, they've closed ALL of them (almost 200). This has resulted in the other pharmacies (WBA, CVS, and independents) being flooded with all of the prescription transfers. Backlogged for days/weeks.",2024-10-04

Long but very skeptical. Will continue to hold but also protect profits.,2024-10-04
"As an experienced deep value investor, I rate this a hold not sell having added when it crashed to 55.00. All you have to do is read Barron’s sum of the parts article this week to realize the true intrinsic value broken up is around 100.00.",2024-10-04
"I have listened to talking heads pitching this stock for several years. ""Nice valuation,"" etc. Stocks are cheap for a reason. All you need to do is visit a CVS store. The front of the stores carry inventory that one can easily buy on Amazon with a couple of mouse clicks. Legendary investor Peter Lynch said  ""invest in what you know."" Just visit a CVS store. CVS stores around here are fairly empty most of the time.",2024-10-04
