"@gss54  I think SLG is a top class owner and manager of NYC office, and if you want exposure to NYC office, their shares are the way to go.The question is how much exposure one wants to office?I moved my exposure away from office into warehouse/industrial starting in 2018.  I want to be where rents are going up faster than inflation.With office, it's difficult to really understand the actual rents as concessions and broker's commissions typically run 2.5-3 years on a 10 year deal.",2024-10-04
"@nsolot Well, I won't argue with you on that one. And we do mostly agree. Interesting you mentioned NYC RE. I was going to take a position in SLGreen back in late 2022, when it really tanked. They had so much coming debt that short term prospects looked very poor and the market began punishing the stock. But last year the stock started to climb and now (it seems) everything is ROSY. SLG is way up these days, so I guess I missed on that one. Still, I wonder if their won't be future problems with their debt levels and NYC commercial real estate market. We'll see...",2024-10-04

"@nsolot I agree with your points. My longer term POV is that the theater market is likely in decline, despite your valid observations. And with rising labor costs and the move to more on-demand video, the margins in that area may well be under continued pressure. Not saying there's no value there for EPR, but I would think they could gradually put their money to better use (with better returns) than in theaters. And the pandemic did help speed along what was already happening to the theater business and I don't see that Genie ever going back into the bottle, so-to-speak. Like I said, a gradual and opportunistic realignment of capital away from theaters would still be my preference for EPR over time.",2024-10-02
"@The Dividend Collectuh @gss54  I'm going to take the other side, as I would like to see them hold the movie theatres, with the caveat that they continue to be units that perform well above average sales.  EPR often highlights that they own 3% of the US theatres by count, and 8% by revenues.The same goes for office buildings, shopping malls, hotels, and so on.  If you own the best A class locations, you will do well.  Try to avoid the B, and C class locations.At an EPR investor presentation a couple years ago, I stated that Netflix didn't kill the movie theatre, but it surely killed Blockbuster (and the other movie rental stores).  The same can be said for live theatre - sure, there are fewer locations than 100 or years ago, before the moving picture was invented, but today people still make trips to see live theater productions and they pay a lot more for those tickets than any movie.  TV may have reduced the number of people going to the baseball park, but fans still love going to see the game in person.   While I'm not personally a fan of horror movies, I know many who love them...  who wants to sit at home and scream alone?  Where's the fun in that?",2024-10-01
@gss54 well said!! I agree. Don't know if they will exit completely but it is something that could benefit them going forward.,2024-10-01
"Would like to see them continue to reduce exposure to the theater segment over time. And eventually exit it altogether. No great rush to get out, but gradually and opportunistically as time goes by. Evidence of that strategy could help them expand their valuation as the market recognizes a shift. Just my 2 cents and GLTA.",2024-10-01
@Tim aWalz's Family Loves Trump that would be great.  They need to work towards where it was before.  It's not the most important thing but it definitely helps build confidence in the stop as they raised the dividend.  SPG is a great example with great management.,2024-09-30
@Tim aWalz's Family Loves Trump agreed. I think theyâ€™re waiting for more clarity regarding rates. I say a penny increase to $0.2950.,2024-09-30
@The Dividend Collectuh would be nice to see a small dividend bump but probably not until the new year.0.2875?,2024-09-30
@Bucknfl I think EPR is positioning themselves for a better future. Also long the ones you named.,2024-09-30
EPR is about a 10th the size of VICI....VICI's next major acquisition?,2024-09-28
@Income4ever aka Cyclenut true. Will take some time. Investors will remain weary because of the dividend cut. But EPR is a good REIT.,2024-09-28
@Vasil Babanov former owner of ABR. I like them. Them and STWD are the only mREITS I like.,2024-09-28
Many don't either know or remember that before covid hit EPR was one of the best overall performance-oriented reits out there trading in the mid $80s....I expect sooner or later it will fully recover SP wise and it's dividend restored to $0.385,2024-09-28
@omghcarman no problem. Have a great weekend. Gotta love those monthly dividends!,2024-09-27
"@Big Sherm better late than never. While I agree this time last year was a beautiful time, EPR and peers should see further price appreciation over the years.",2024-09-27
"Just recently added a position, I know I am late and missed the best deal but still looks like a fair value to add some diversification in my REIT allocation. Should be some tailwinds for a while. Thanks for the article.",2024-09-27
Thank You for the article. Long EPR at an average cost of $41.57 and reinvesting.,2024-09-27
