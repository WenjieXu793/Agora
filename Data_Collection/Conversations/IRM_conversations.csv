"@jgrever621 Great comment and your views are similar to my own. I continue to hold, but this position has now risen to my third largest position in a substantial retirement account. As you stated, I am somewhat uncomfortable with this, especially with the dividend yield now below 3%. I'm going to keep a close eye on this one, turn off dividend reinvestment, and look around for a larger yield in another equity. Do you mind if I ask where you redeployed your proceeds?",2024-09-30
"I think IRM will continue doing well, but I sold due to valuation at 108.  My reasns were it is way past earning potential (for now), and growth had to be limited for some time. So i took sizable profits and reinvested; selling is a rarely in my portfolio. My goals are dividend income with anticaped regular growth, and some possibility of capital gains. IRM exceeded anything I might have projected when I went long to the point I was uncomfortable.IRM is a good stock and long term will do well, including rising dividends. And while you are downgrading the stock its because of excessing success not problems. Really, a great reason for any stock.",2024-09-29
"This was one of the more positive downgrade articles on IRM. So I thank you for that. The IRM management team adopted a multi prong strategy several years ago and have actually implemented it and have seen positive continual results. I would not classify it as rapid. In the past, downgrade / sell articles on IRM have been greeted with stock price increases, and I hope yours will be no different. Appreciate it.",2024-09-29
@aterosin Even on a down day it goes up.  I am still trying to come to terms with the upgrade to $240 on September 23. j MY overall gain over a 7 year period is about 420% (including capital gains and dividends).,2024-09-25
"@Bucknfl yes, I have seen it too. In the meantime, I have seen my IRM gains add up to 208% :-)",2024-09-24
I sure enjoy my shares that I bought for $25 and the dividend but I am not sure about driping at this price. For me I prefer to reinvest in other reits for now.,2024-09-24
Sold 100 at 117.60….since the ceo  just sold a ton at 114 last week…still have 2100 shares….i,2024-09-23
"I purchased IRM almost seven years ago and have seen a 208% increase, excluding dividends. Recently, I sold one-third of my position. IRM has been a challenging stock for many analysts on Seeking Alpha; over the past four years, many have downgraded it, only to watch it reach new highs. One author wrote a series of articles over three months, providing minimal analysis and mainly personal opinions that the stock should decline because it had risen too much. His articles could be described as being from the genre, glom and doom.This morning, a reputable analyst from Stifel Nicolaus raised his target price for IRM to $140. He has an impressive success rate of 88% with this stock.IRM is transforming from a storage and shredding company into a more diversified entity, now including storage, shredding, and data centers.One note of caution: some insiders recently sold shares of IRM. I will be monitoring any future sales closely.",2024-09-23
In at $31. I already sold 1/3 of my shares awhile back after a similar warning. The stock flew higher. I'm holding. Gerry in Oregon,2024-09-22
My company used them once/ mediocre service/ makes it difficult to invest when you have had such experience,2024-09-21
"I am grateful to own IRM at $35.75. As you suggest I will continue to hold it, but I allocate the dividends to other companies at better prices in my portfolio. I suppose I could increase my income by selling my position and using the profits to increase shares in other companies but I'm glad to have some profitable companies to offset some of the others, like T and LEG.",2024-09-21
"Agreed. Not only for this specific stock, but with the major market indices at all time highs, it's appropriate to review our portfolios closely with an eye toward harvesting gains rather than planting new seeds.",2024-09-21
"@Juxtaposed Ideas Very nice article and very well spelled out.  Contrary to your div reinvestment suggestion, I already turned mine off because if I'm not going to buy at 25.9x AFFO then I don't want to reinvest at that level either.  I am also pleased to confirm my $97 floor is close to your 94!  Thank you!",2024-09-21
"I agree. I will not be adding at these levels. I put a stop loss at 110, I'm willing to lose the very peak. I will be satisfied  with 4x I made on this stock not including dividends. Great run for IRM, but it doesn't mean it's over",2024-09-21
"I’m in in the 30s ..sold a few calls in the 70s….bye bye stock….i saw on yahoo that the cfo….who is a superb speaker at functions, sold a ton at 88 not  that long ago, and the ceo just sold a ton last week at 109…..yeah , but they keep getting more options….we don’t.:[",2024-09-17
"I’ve owned IRM since 2017, even added some at 21 during  covid ( wish I bought more). I originally bought for income & simply ignored all the calls to sell. I’m holding for the long term.",2024-09-17
"A run rate of $600 billion, huh?They have to mean $600 million, right?",2024-09-11
