@Kirk Spano In order to get back to better there may be some resistance but that bit of resistance is far better for the future than the destruction we are seeing now.,2024-10-02
@boris gudonov Every one of these investment firms have a list. Maybe they're pitching their book. They want you to buy the price up! ;-),2024-10-02
"@golfcat1 we ought to control the border, but, we ought to be issuing enough work visas and green cards to offset Boomer retirements. That requires millions of immigrants per year.",2024-10-01
@santlo It won't. Markets will tank if the weird guys take over. They are a threat to democracy and capitalism.,2024-09-30
"@erbrown Don’t bet the farm on that. I don’t see cap gain tax on unrealized gains. For openers, evaluations are impossible, not only for the likes of farm land but also for 1000 shares of a publicly-traded stock, liquidity is a big deal. Then there’s the velue of the local family business. Not so fast.",2024-09-29

"It's inconceivable a DIYer can make a 747 in his garage, not so hard a DIYer could make a competing CGM product on his workbench. Thus Dexcom does not deserve to be a third of *Boeing's value and I'm not saying Boeing is underpriced, *Boeing being my standard thumbnail reality checkAlso, it is sad that all the ultra-processed foods crammed with sugars, seed oils, and in general waste products and toxic chemicals are making more diabetics in our society. I know this company is meeting a demand but it is perverse in the sense of the future health of a productive economy.",2024-09-19
@ndardick I’ve sold the Jan 65 puts for income.  I don’t share this authors optimism or reasoning for a 40x multiple on a challenged 15% growth rate.  Hope they have a better third Q to keep this  thing above water.  MM62,2024-09-16
@slodon28 of course it will - just ask Milton Friedman. Spending leads to inflation (Why I sold any bond holding/ blended fund before 2022). Don't make this so hard.,2024-09-16
@TJ Burke Wont all of that NEW that government spending increase inflation?,2024-09-16
Spending will take off again under Harris. All her initiatives require new spending. It's objective reality and your lack of policy awareness or shallow partisanship does not change it.,2024-09-15

"imo, PODD business is more secured than DXCM w/ its recently FDA approved delivery device for T2 patients. DXCM still benefits w/ licensing fee.",2024-09-11
"Thank you for your in-depth analysis. You do have a big mistake in your article, however. Insulet (PODD) is not a competitor. Insulet produces wearable, automated insulin pumps and insulin therapy informatics. Insulet does not manufacture CGMs. They are actually a Dexcom partner and the devices of both manufacturers communicate with each other to form a closed-loop insulin therapy system.",2024-09-11
I think they will get bought out if the stock falls another 20-25%. Someone like $JNJ might buy them after resolving their talc litigation problems.,2024-09-11
"I tried using a Dexcom. Installation demanded privacy-violating permissions but even still, on a burner phone, 3 versions of the app failed to load. The $70 device then failed to lock in. Each one has its own injector and altogether they use copious amounts of plastic making them extremely environmentally unfriendly.I will pass until they clean up their act.I will wait until glucose and ketone monitoring can be accurately done by a solar-powered ring.",2024-09-11
