"Excellent bar chart showing quarterly ARR SaaS revenue $ and TTM growth rate of the same. Unfortunately I wouldn't know a flash from a hard disk if you put it under my nose. I wish I could learn enough to understand this one, but it currently lies outside my circle of competence.",2024-10-06
I too have been a long time holder; it will grind higher as the need and desirability of their products become more and more recognized. We are in one of many oscillating bottoms as it moves up. Stay long; they are defining the future of storage.,2024-10-06
"I have owned this since the mid twenties. I think the secular growth story is for real as people keep 10,000 photos in the cloud and companies keep generating tons of e-paperwork that needs to be stored. Didn't like the recent drop but I sold some in the low 60. While the EPS are not eye popping they will grind higher. Gonna stay in this thing for a few more years. Appreciate the analysis.",2024-10-06
"@heung My take is look at Talen, Constellation, its a fight for power at the moment. HDDs can't compete at all with flash.  I think whatever companies keep HDDs will be at a severe disadvantage and the ones who adopt it will be the leaders.",2024-10-04
@DomL thx . This is only a reiteration of their message in earnings transcript . I don’t think hhd will be replaced all finally .,2024-10-03
"If the port strike snarls overseas supply chains (if it spreads to the west coast), there might be an interesting impact to the broader storage industry, but PSTG proved tremendous strength in this area last time.",2024-10-02
@heung see @thepsakis this will be a monumental moment because it means the end of HDD is approaching being ushered in by Pure.,2024-10-02
"CEO just reiterated hyperscale win by EOY.  Will be a massive win according to block and files, change the paradigm of storage.",2024-09-27
"@thepsakis I agree!  great insight.  Will be fun to watch this grow, be well friend!",2024-09-27
Thanks for taking the time to research and analyze. ‘Will continue to hold.,2024-09-26
@tclevel522 these companies are component suppliers to OEMs. They are like Goodyear/Firestone to Ford/GM.,2024-09-26
"Good review, but no mention of other flash drive/storage companies such as $STX or $WDC or others. Would appreciate hearing any comments on these potential competitors, their technologies, and market share. Thank you.",2024-09-25
"@DomL Well, if you consider they already breached the $70 threshold once, I'd say you're right. It's like the company disappeared off a lot of radars after two or three years of hype/scrutiny from their IPO.They just keep growing. I don't mind. I expect they will be a lot like ANET in a year or two, especially if we factor in the hyperscaler win, which will have an exponential effect on the amount of product they will manufacture and ship.",2024-09-25
"And now, for the 11th year in a row, the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for primary storage. In a world where data is the most valuable commodity in business, Pure is leading the industry across all metrics for maximizing data leverage. Not to mention, they also make the highest capacity and density solid state drives in the world, and are not in any danger of anyone catching up.This is going to be a fun one to hold for the next 3-5 years.",2024-09-25
Innovator company who is customer focused.  They made a product that is very simple to use.  I suspect many will miss out on this company's rise.,2024-09-25
"@Strgbrw appreciate your feedback!  If you look at the peers info for this stock from Seeking Alpha, those three firms are listed as peers:seekingalpha.com/...",2024-09-17
"Agree with DomL.  Also, it's odd to compare with Lenovo, Seagate Technology  and Western Digital. Customers are typically evaluating Pure's offerings with those from Netapp, HPE and Dell.",2024-09-17
Pure from what I've gathered from many in the field is essentially the NVDA of storage.  They have nailed the hardware and software.  Once they scale to 300-600-1200TB of storage who will stop them? No other company is putting out specs like that. IMO the upside is to great to worry about 10-15 downside.,2024-09-16
"@Chris Lau APP, PEGA, and GPN, in that order, seem really interesting.  TY!",2024-09-13
@RealRural QQQJ maybe?  Index fund though and newer so performance isn't that impressive yet.,2024-09-10
