"@Stratos Capital Partners Who is ""we""? Pluralis majestatis? Are this article and the comments community work? I tried to find the answer in your bio, but it too goes back and forth between plural and singular. The different asset managers in your comparison are fundamentally different from each other, and I doubt the valuation metrics are comparable. The article contains no conclusive reasoning. Gladly I'm running my own family's family office myself ;)",2024-09-12
"Hi @comeinvestwithme, thank you for your comments.Sure, if we look hard and deep enough, we will find all the reasons we need to explain why Carlyle is underperforming its peers. We admit we haven't looked hard or deep enough. But we prefer to look at the more significant pieces of the puzzle and call the shot when we have enough clarity.We looked at Carlyle's recent fundraising efforts, and there is no evidence to suggest that its business model or reputation has been permanently damaged.

It needs deeper analysis.",2024-09-11

The company's robust AUM (assets under management) growth, supported by strategic fundraising efforts and strong performance in its investment portfolio, underscores its competitive positioning. Additionally, Carlyle's commitment to generating sustainable cash flows and its ability to capitalize on market opportunities further solidify its potential for long-term value creation. Lastly, their focus on leveraging technology and data analytics in investment processes positions them well for continued strength in an evolving market landscape.The stock is very good value based on its 5y PEGY ratio 0.59 and therefore a very strong buy.Long $CGThe stock doesn't get the attention it deserves from pessimists.Very good.This is the basis for countercyclical buy signals.",2024-09-11
