I am hearing about big oversupply in life sciences properties- and a couple of hedge fund mgrs shorting this stock in particular.  anyone have any sense on this? thx!,2024-09-25
@NorthZorro Negative Commentary of CNBC today.  Oversupply was one of the major points of the Short.,2024-09-24
"Was fortunate to load up when it dropped below $100.   It‘s a hold in the $120‘s.  I‘m letting the dividends drip, and selling monthly covered calls when it makes sense - I sold a bunch this week.   Given a choice, I would rather the stock stay in this trading band.   The dividends buy more shares, the company continues to execute & increase the dividend.   There is a lot to like.GLTA",2024-09-20
"Well, I could argue that 94.6% occupancy rate is not that high, there are REITS with ~99%Other than that yes, I agree, I have a tiny position for a 4.2% div yield + 5-6% div growth + small price gains with rate cuts ahead, which gives more than 10%Options make even more sense than just the stock.",2024-09-17
@Florida_Dreaming $VAC looks too risky taking into account large debt and expected recession. I would rather buy $CZR (I'm selling puts).,2024-09-14
@Druvaciam Aleh That may actually happen if we get a general selloff in addition to tax loss selling since REXR is one of the only REITs down somewhat significantly year to date.  I have a full position of that one around $43 or so.  ARE I got just under $100 but only bought half position.  Was really hoping it would get back there as I want to load up but that ship may have sailed.  It was on the trend line but didn't breakdown and now shot up.  I may end up with what I have.I've been looking hard at VAC since Soros has a large position in it.  The question is do we get a semi hard landing.  I still think we do so I'm holding off but in a recession that should be a multi bagger from the lows.,2024-09-14
@Florida_Dreaming Great! I want to buy $REXR at $45. Sold puts some time ago and hope to be assigned.,2024-09-13
@Druvaciam Aleh Never forget this.  It's because I own it and don't own any other office REIT.  Same reason REXR is underperforming.  I'm not selling either.....,2024-09-13
$ARE becoming one of the cheapest office REITs. All other popular office REITS are up 100%-200% from its lows already.,2024-09-13
"@battered If you live in the Boston area, you will notice that bio lab buildings are popping up everywhere, which leads me to believe that there might be an oversupply problem down the road.",2024-09-13
"Continues to be an overhyped REIT by many SA analysts, while it hasn't even been rising to the tides of the average REIT.",2024-09-12
"Good article. I agree $ARE is synonymous with quality yet hasn’t seen the same gains as other REIT sector leaders. As you stated I believe there is material upside to be found here! I have followed you and look forward to reading future analysis.Best,Daniel",2024-09-12
