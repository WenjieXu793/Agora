"@nnavlakha I believe what he is referring to here is that the risk/reward profile is asymmetric, it has nothing to do with the absolute stock price. Unlike with shorting stocks, the most that can be lost by going long is 100%. But the potential gain is far greater than 100%.For the sake of argument, suppose you reckon Chegg can hit $8.50 in a successful turnaround scenario, or about a 5-bagger from the current price. Furthermore, suppose there is a one in three chance this happens. Those aren't great odds, but the potential upside still indicates it is a good bet.At the race track, it is called betting on outsiders, in the investing world, it is called speculation.",2024-10-04
@Paul Franke it seems it will hit another low soon. Around 1 it would be an interesting bet,2024-10-03
I'm waiting for some insider CEO CFO buys. When that happens I will roll the dice and put some money long into chegg,2024-10-03
zero insider buying at these levels tells you all you need to know.,2024-10-02
@PolarisCapital I do not suggest putting more than 5% into any single security.,2024-10-02
"@Paul Franke That being said, Debt is being valued at par.  Chegg has strategically been buying back debt well below par. This will lead a great total cash position into 2026.   Stock will be a 5 bagger by then.",2024-10-02
I agree that it's undeniably cheap but I still struggle to see the pathway for the stock moving forward. CheggMate did not even get an explicit mention in its 2Q results. Cash flow from operations declined 50% yoy after excluding the write-off. I see that it's your side bet and you are rating it a Buy provided that it's just a tiny portion of your portfolio. But would you still rate it a Buy if you have to size it up to >10% of your capital?,2024-10-02
What do you mean limited downside?  Every stock has 100% downside irrespective whether stock is at $2 or $200,2024-10-01
"Bulls here are fixated on valuation metrics while ignoring the fact that the business is completely dead. I believe the only reason revenues haven't nosedived yet is that many subs are on parents' credit cards and go unnoticed.ChatGPT has completely destroyed the business model. There are even more powerful tools such as mathgpt where you can upload a photo and it will solve the problem for you. No student is going to pay chegg to be a 3rd party wrapper for a chat gpt product. You could get a technical bounce at some point, but that would be a trade and not based on any fundamental analysis. This business is dead to rights, and shareholders would be better served if they tried to sell themselves to an acquirer for pennies, or undergo a liquidation and distribute the remaining scraps.",2024-10-01
"@Thiede Value Investing Roughly, yes, if you include ""long term investments"" line on balance sheet.  About $605 million in cash and investments vs. $600 million in total debt (long and short term).",2024-10-01
"@Cactusbrush Share dilution for cash is already happening at Chegg through employee stock compensation. I would say $100 to $150 million in cash flow annually makes the net debt total very manageable. If future cash flow generation becomes an issue, yes, the stock quote will not recover much.",2024-10-01
"@Ba6a_Yaga If you bought out the whole company for $185 million and received $100 million in free cash flow annually to pocket for yourself, after 2 years you would have recovered your initial investment. Future cash flow and company value would be gravy. What if Chegg develops a killer AI destination for students the world over in a few years with a value in the billions? It's a distinct possibility.",2024-10-01
I too am interested in the details of the $243 Million in debt. Will this easily be covered by reduced cashflow? When is it maturing?,2024-10-01
@Paul Franke debt load is not great but certainly not unmanageable. Asymmetric risk/reward currently for investors willing to accept that CHGG could either be x5 in a year or two or half of today’s market cap.,2024-10-01
@typecheck and Instagram is based on a business model that is a true plague to modern society and in particularly mental well being - and still an incredibly valuable business!,2024-10-01
"Agreed, this is a cheap stock.However, in my personal opinion and experience you should just watch and wait for the turnaround first. The uncertainty is very large currently in this name. Even at a higher price this could be a better investment if clouds clear on the investment",2024-10-01
"@Ba6a_Yaga I’m good with $4 it’s over 100%! Then I’ll sell half. Or $3 then I’ll sell 2/3s. Or I’m wrong it’s a tiny spec position.It’s a value play, is it a trap? IDK. At a pe of 2 it’s worth the risk.",2024-10-01
"Interesting idea, thanks.I bought the JAN 2026 $3 calls for 50 cents.",2024-10-01
@Ba6a_Yaga the catalyst is price and mean reversion of the PE. Short squeeze could be one. Second is the market sees more value.,2024-10-01
"Excellent pick, what the heck I’ve followed it a long time I’m in. Thx Paul.",2024-10-01
