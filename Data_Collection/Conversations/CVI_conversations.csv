"@BillJK1 - Assigning 1/4 to 1/3 odds to a $200 plus selling price strikes me as aggressive, but if playing for gambling money, better than putting it all on a number on the roulette wheel in Vegas.",2024-10-06
@BillJK1 I’m going to try and get some 105 Oct calls tomorrow morning.,2024-10-06
"@Cue Ball 38,000 ton at hookers point and other storage facilities around the bay .",2024-10-06
"@TX_value There probably will not be, but for a potential 130X payout on an event that has a 1/4 or 1/3 odds, using money you can afford to lose, it could still be worth looking at. These types of opportunities don't come along that often. Just go into it assuming you're likely to lose 100%.",2024-10-06
@Cue Ball Ammonia is imported into Tampa (mostly from Trinidad) so that Mosaic can use it in their production of phosphates (DAP).  There is no supply there.,2024-10-06
@Cue Ball yes. Tropical storm Milton is expected to hit Tampa. Storm surge and flooding likely to disrupt production and put more strain on supply.,2024-10-06
@Publius Now where is there a large supply of anhydrous ammonia ?Tampa .,2024-10-06
@BillJK1 ， My take is there will be not transaction before the year end.,2024-10-06
"Is it just me, or are the November 2024 120 Calls starting to look tempting? Only $0.60 last I looked. And if it works, could be worth $80. I only hold the Jan 2025s now, but I might have to wet my beak on the Novembers.",2024-10-05

"@LibraRM The problem with using EW here is that it is effective for broad markets, but not so much for individual equities - even the EW people acknowledge that - too many variables and impact of fundamentals in individual companies - many recent fundamentals have been noted here that make it very likely the EWT chart is invalidated re UAN - will be instructional to see which expectation turns out to be correct…..",2024-10-05
"@mingus33 just replace them with cheap calls; eg. sell 1000 shares for 67k, use 7k to buy ten $70 calls for $7 (maybe $9 if you go to May); you still get 100% of any upside above $77",2024-10-04
@Hungry for Knowledge You know what I hate about UAN best? I'm not owner of every single share!,2024-10-04
"@Hungry for Knowledge there is a sure fire way for the deal to be announced.  ....   as my cash squeeze gets more severe, I might be forced to sell some UAN shares - once that happens you are guaranteed an announcement.  The more shares I sell, the higher the stated purchase price will be.  By the end of October, I will likely need to sell at least 1,000 shares - hang in there boys - Xmas will be here 2 months early",2024-10-04
"Global urea prices up 14% this week, 20% in the last 2 1/2 weeks.  NOLA urea is now $30 below the world price.  Things are looking great",2024-10-04
"@Hungry for Knowledge Gross ammonia is the total amount of ammonia produced by a plant, then you can either sell it as ammonia or upgrade it into UAN, urea, DEF or AN.",2024-10-04
@Dynamic_Value_Investor On the most recent conference call the CF CEO screamed bloody murder about how extremely undervalued CF's assets are.,2024-10-04
@Hungry for Knowledge Edited:  Original comment was re UAN so I was confused at the pricing - EW guys from Seeking Alpha have UAN going to $45.  But I see you were answering re CF - my mistake!,2024-10-04
@Dynamic_Value_Investor Should add that the Wever plant just sold for over $4000 per ton of ammonia.And CVRP traded at a premium to CF until a few years ago.  MLP's have all taken a valuation hit since 2015.,2024-10-04
"@Dynamic_Value_Investor What's the difference between the EV/gross ton of ammonia and EV/ton of ammonia?  I am up to speed on that, and it seems very significant that UAN is at parity with CF on the second one.As / if CF climbs to $100-140 that bodes well for UAN, all other things being equal.",2024-10-04
