"I think as far as investing in the equity is concerned, you've missed a few points:Yes, they are turning the business around from an operational perspective. And yes, I think it is sensible to think they can eventually get EBITDA margins back up to USPH's levels. They've done a great job getting visits per day and clinic productivity back up. However, the labor market for physical therapists is a huge headwind that isn't going to let up any time soon, and their operating margins are still weak. What I don't think you've considered yet: They're still running out of cash and are likely to need another restructuring that will come at a significant cost to equity holders. Half their cash balance is tied up in joint ventures and the cash isn't available for servicing debt and for general corporate purposes. Very unlikely they can pull out of this before running out of cash again. Additionally, the 2L PIK notes have a conversion feature that was structured as part of the last restructuring. If the company actually starts performing well, the 2L will either convert at $12.5 or the company will force a conversion to reduce debt which they can elect to do beginning in mid-2025. With a market cap of $26m or so, the equity is basically at option value and is either going to zero or going to get severely diluted to the point of being worthless. And that is before even considering the preferred equity, which is 12% PIK and running up a massive balance and will be virtually impossible for them to pay down. This thing is like 95% headed to another restructuring, and existing equity is going to get slammed over and over again, even though it is a viable business from an operating perspective. But it's so highly levered and buried under interest expense that it won't be able to pull out from under it. Because it's a viable business, creditors are going to come to the table in my opinion to keep this thing kicking along, but that doesn't bode well for common shareholders. This thing is a value sink and there are much better places to park your cash. This is not a capital structure you want to be investing at the bottom of.",2024-08-27
