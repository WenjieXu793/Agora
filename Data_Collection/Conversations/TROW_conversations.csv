@Dpdraw6 - I discussed why this has occurred in the article. I think net outflows are much less than 33 billion so far in 2024.,2024-10-01
@amfmswlw - It's because of market action. Net outflows have not fully reversed yet. But the company will earn more on higher AUM.,2024-10-01
"@Dividend Power stock market up so AUM up,  However net flow of funds (per Morningstar):2024 YTD -  33 Billion OUT2023          -   50 Billion OUT2022          -   59 Billion OUTOutflows exceed inflows every year back to 2015…. This is too common among most managed fund companies - even the acclaimed American Funds has net outflows last few years.",2024-09-30
"@Dividend Power Is it up because of money coming in, or because the stock market is up?  I think I have a good idea which it is.",2024-09-30
I would say just the opposite of your headline. You gotta be patient AFTER you buy it. LOL,2024-09-30
"Sadly, investors pulling massive assets out of T Rowe.  Similar to Franklin (BEN).  I own T Rowe for a few years and it has been no bueno.",2024-09-30
"Appreciate the update, thx! I agree. Rates rates rates need to go lower lower lower to mean revert the dividend. IMO. TROW is a stock I’ve followed for years and never owned. Similar to BEN. At 5% Div and rates falling this looks better. Long PRU.",2024-09-29
"@dgi123 Lately, TROW has been OK, it has rallied $5 over the last week, which is ok.  Revenues and EPS are good the dividend yield is 4.5.  There are not many companies that match the quality and financial strength of TROW.  You like BLK.",2024-09-25
"@Kurt Licherovsky No it's not... when competitors in this space continue to grow AUM due to net inflows, it's obvious TROW is not doing well. The market has been racing upwards for the past year or so and yet TROW's AUM has barely increased because net outflows are huge. This means revenue and eps does not increase by much. Also, if TROW's AUM remains flat in an roaring bull market, what happens when the market falls? Answer: it gets combined with net outflows so AUM plummets and so do revenue, eps, and your returns",2024-09-20
"@dgi123 1.61T is still awesome, I agree with you but you are too severe, TROW pays a good div and has healthy earnings.  TROW is quality, the stock price sucks, BRICK and mortar TROW is still good.",2024-09-20
"I read all the comments, yes AUM has declined, and there are sell recommendations by a handful of analysts.  I held shares through the dividend and had a poor trade and ended up with nothing. The shares I hold have rallied but I'm taking a loss on this trade.  They say your first loss is your best loss.",2024-09-20
"GOOD call BLUE CHIP, it looks to me like TROW is oversold, I'm looking for $112's and higher.",2024-09-20
"@Blue Chip Portfolios AUM has NOT increased because the forces of rising prices is directly countered by net outflows. For example, TROW's AUM was 1.62T in 2021 Q2. seekingalpha.com/...Just last month, TROW's AUM was 1.61T seekingalpha.com/...AUM has been flat for the past 3 years because TROW has experienced severe net outflows. In contrast, BLK has net inflows so if you're going to buy an asset manager, BLK is the clear winner in this space",2024-09-18
@cegibbs disagree. TROW is an important investment manager to many individuals and institutions.,2024-09-17
@dgi123 despite the net outflows AUM has risen due to rising markets. While this might be less preferred it is still an increase in assets. Flows have been challenging for the entire industry due to higher rates over the past few years. Lower rates may very well be a tailwind over the next few years and lead to net inflows,2024-09-17

"I don't think so. Just sold out of this completely as of today. I've had this for over 2 years, and with dividends I'm just about even. Made nothing. Someone else can try with my old shares. I'm out.",2024-09-17
Rising AUM sure... but TROW has had net outflows for the past 4 years straight... they're clearly losing this race and are not a company worth owning,2024-09-17
"@Investing for Freedom TROW is growing not because of inflows (they actually have net outflows), but rather the stock market.",2024-09-17
"@cegibbs Market competition always works like that. T Row Price will not disappear overnight. It may lose the market to its competitors overtime. So what? KO could disappear overtime but I can guarantee you there are many other brands/companies will fill KO market shares. So is TSM, AAPL and MSFT. Your statement does not make much sense because TROW AUM is growing since 2010 (www.macrotrends.net/...). $TROW is fine for now, but no guarantee in 50 years. So is any other company.",2024-09-17
