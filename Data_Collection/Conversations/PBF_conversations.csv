PBF is the least leveraged among these refiners. The analyst doesn’t know what he’s talking about…,2024-09-21
"@A Retired Investor - I sure hope you sold some shares when it was near $180! The dividend is like 3% which is pretty pathetic if you ask me.  I once had shares of HollyFrontier that I bought in the $30s and $40s and that ended up getting into the $80s.  I never sold and it went right back down (eventually) to the $20s and $30s. I severely regretted that.  Never again for me. The dividends these refiners pay are NOT that great. Buying and holding is for suckers.  Sorry, but, I learned my lesson with Delek and HF Sinclair that I own now, and I was selling SMALL amounts of shares at peaks and watching these cyclical stocks come right back down is exactly what I expected.  Now, I can reload and hold for the next upswing.  Before, I was holding a full bag of these while others were selling and taking profits.  Like I said, learned my lesson.",2024-09-20
Five plus years and holding.  With all the ups and downs it is like riding a roller coaster at times.  I've watched it go from the Covid lows of less than $40 to the recent $180's.  At my age I have no plans on selling.  I just sit back and collect the dividends it pays me.,2024-09-20

@Paul Franke Thanks.  Not sure what the rules are for posting links but I was glancing at this (EBIT) when I made the comment.www.macrotrends.net/...,2024-09-19

"Interesting article, Ty.  I agree, PBF is cheap. I sold some 11/15  $25 strike put contracts, to see if I can buy it cheaper. It seems like a good time to open a small position, in PBF.",2024-09-12
@Ronald Ferrie well your projections seem to be accurate... It will be interesting to see where the stock finds a bottom at.,2024-09-12
"@me66 my original projections had the share price dropping to between $25-$30/share so we are getting closer.Keep in mind, crack spreads have dropped decently since this article was published.",2024-09-11
"Reread this article, along with others, as PBF caught my attention again. I sold some 11/15/24, $25 puts. I would be happy to buy at $25, but I don't think we will get there. The stock @ $31 today is a P/B of 0.58, I believe we are near a bottom. As Spartakus73 mentioned there is also $1B in cash and stock buyback occuring.",2024-09-11

@Simon Chatham I planed to buy VLO at $70 but missed. Now it is $130,2024-09-09
