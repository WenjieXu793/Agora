"I like the overall analysis including the attention to operating leverage and oper margins.  To the extent that ROK has been trading margin for R&D, as you noted, that spending has been rewarded.  I looked at adjusting margins for R&D spending by capitalizing/ amortizing R&D over time to see what impact this might have.  This didn't increase operating margins very much.  R&D as a % of revenues has been around 5.9% over the past several years.  Under my assumptions, R&D would have to be closer to 10% of Revs in order to have a more meaningful impact on oper margin.",2024-08-22
"@redbaron They own factory automation in the U.S. They're not as strong ex-US (Siemens is), nor as strong in hybrid or process. This isn't to denigrate them, but to offer a little context.",2024-08-22
"I bought the dip on ROK, largely because of a relative who works in a related industry told me, '...........Rockwell owns automation......', and the dip, but I understand the concerns on valuation. I will hold for now, but they do have to perform better.",2024-08-22
"I've been interested in buying ROK ever since Barrons did an article on them back in 2023, I think it was. Always stymied by the price, it is up there with Microsoft. I think that plenty of people want in, because they believe with the rest of us that automation is the future, just like we see it to a large extent in the present. Our machines are taking over, just isn't as much need for... us.",2024-08-22
