"@New Adams Viterra acquisition.  Aren't they rolling over this debt, though, not new debt?",2024-09-12
@New Adams Not all debt is bad. If they can use the cash to get better return than the interest they are paying I say go for it. Longterm I think the Viterra merger will be massively positive.,2024-09-11
