"@Ryan Garcia Yes...$20b or below -but remember, they have almost 70% more revenue than RCL.",2024-10-02
They need to lower the debt to 20-22b (similar to that of RCL) for a bigger upside. I think it is very feasible by end of 2025.,2024-10-01

@robthediver And I hope you used the shareholder bonus program for each one of those.  Cheers!,2024-09-30
We are in a weird time where beating the earnings estimates is no longer a catalyst to move the stock forward. NVDA just experienced this as well. I find this troubling,2024-09-30
Double beat... nice work.Looks like the street didn't like the higher ALBD numbers for Q4 -but one has to wonder how much will lower fuel costs offset the higher number of drydock days? Not a lot of commentary on the webcast on fuel costs at all.,2024-09-30

"I’ve been accumulating shares, averaging $15 per and have seen a 48% gain, so far. Since this time last year, CCL has been on a 1 step back, two steps forward trajectory. Beating expectations, the industry experiencing record bookings at higher prices and an overall bullish view of the industry, I’ll continue to accumulate.",2024-09-29
"Good article, Manika...certainly thought provoking.As an avid cruiser with a few CCL trips coming up and seeing how the ships are booked, I might be a bit more bullish than you -and I guess we'll see shortly. Besides the outlook, any larger-than-expected reduction in debt or debt servicing costs could provide additional tailwinds for the stock, but try as might, I cannot find any info on QTD efforts in this area.Are you aware of any significant activities in this area that have been made public recently?Thanks and regards",2024-09-26
