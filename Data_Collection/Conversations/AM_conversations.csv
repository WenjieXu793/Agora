"@Stlbeerman68 I'd rather hold for the divi and as a hedge against oil price risks than trade AM. That's just me, but I like your idea for it being a tactical swing trade.",2024-09-26
@Celandina I don't have anything on my radar at $2. But I don't track everything.,2024-09-26
"@sapient I was NOT talking about a dividend increase right NOW.I was asking opinions as other SA articles implied that AM willNOT increase their dividend after meeting debt targets and may NEVER, NEVER, NEVER as they fell in love with buybacks.The other issue of why executives often want to do buybacks is to offset share options and often that is ALL the buybacks do.That is their personal reason- not to benefit shareholders.",2024-09-21
"@Chancer AM will do buybacks after achieving the leverage target of 3x debt/EBITDA.  They will not increase the dividend at this time.  This is what AM management has stated repeatedly including on their most recent conference call.  Opinions of authors on SA may vary, but I would recommend going with what AM management has stated.I am with management in favor of buybacks vs. increased dividends at this stage as the equity buybacks pencil out as accretive AND will reduce future cash flow needs for dividends.  After some period of buybacks, then I would foresee AM deciding to boost the dividend on a reduced share count.",2024-09-20
"@Chancer Hey that's fine. The article was a bit negative just because of the dividend. My point was the cut actually ended up helping us more than if we would have had the $1.20. There's a reason companies cut, some good, some bad: and then companies either restore the dividend, take a while or don't bother. I like some dividend growth as well, I don't care if it's a penny, just show some sort of growth, or a special.",2024-09-18
"@upnorthwi I am not complaining as the yield on my cost is 25%+.If next 2024 YE ROC is 80%, my yield on cost will be about 31+%.In about 4+ years, my AM shares cost could be zero.Then dividends will be reported as cap gains. For personal reasons, I will not pay any tax.Therefore my AM dividends will be tax free.But all I want with increased dividends is -just a little more; because I always likehigher dividends- not buybacks. Why do I need buybacks, if my shares gain in value with ROC?",2024-09-18
"@Elephant Analytics Great article on AM.Do you agree with another SA article, that AM will not increase the dividend after they meet their debt target, because AM did previously say they would increase the dividend back to $1.20 when they previously cut. This view is there will only be buybacks.Would be a disappointment if AM does not increase the dividend.I do like your $16.60 value.",2024-09-18
"@mwh27 Yes, per IRS regs, the broker is supposed to adjust stock basis to account for ROC.  The January and April payouts were about 70% ROC.  AM hasn't published an 8937 for the August dividend, so that means 0% ROC at this time for that one.  But this can all change at the year end financial wrap up.",2024-09-18
Anybody know for sure what happens with taxes if you sell some of this outside an IRA?  Guessing that the broker reduces the basis by the distributions already collected.  Is that correct?  Thanks!,2024-09-18
"Very nice article and layout concerning AM.  I own a small amount of shares at $8.31, up 81%.  You caught my attention as you see a 30% upside.  My conundrum is, do I add at this price or continue investing my dividend in other investments.  Food for thought!   Thanks",2024-09-18
"I am fine with buybacks. Buybacks are just as much a return of capital as dividends. Eventually they will surprise with a dividend increase but if they talk about it, analysts will not let it rest on conference calls. Not talking about it gives them options.",2024-09-17
"Looking back at that $1.20, share price was down to $8. Cut to $0.90 and share price has now nearly doubled. If you had the $0.30 you would have gained $4.20 in dividends vs $7 in share price. Keep in mind that the $1.20 was for 2 years, prior it was less than half. Now you have a stable dividend and growing share price, I'm happy.",2024-09-17
"@labman106 Your numbers are a bit off. It went from $35 to $21 in 2017, and declined from there to $2 in 2020. A lot going on with the company and the oil industry. Look at some of the previous articles and news, that tell you a lot.",2024-09-17
"Disappointing if AM does not increase dividend back to $1.20 as they said they would.Buybacks are very often just a cover up for large amounts of share options for executives. When that occurs, not much gain.I will continue as a LT hold because is just too big of a yield for me.But at these prices, I will not add.",2024-09-17
The easy way to play it is buy in the 13s and sell at 15. This happens several times a year,2024-09-17
"I bought AM about 3 years ago when it offered an 8.4% dividend, which I set on Drip and have let ride with excellent results. From a broader perspective, all of my C-Corp holdings bought around the same time have risen to their fair market values and are holds, including AM, PAGP, Oneok, Williams and Kinder Morgan. They are now morphing into growth and income stocks instead of their formed role as high yield stocks given the promising growth outlooks for natural gas in particular surrounding exports and a parabolic increase in demand for electricity. I donâ€™t feel these stocks will ever return to previous price and dividend levels and need to be viewed in a new light going forward.",2024-09-17
"I think investors buy midstream based on yield to them, not FCF yield.  So until a dividend increase becomes highly likely, it's not probable that $16+ will be realized.",2024-09-17
"AM's priority for its FCF is very sensible: Debt reduction first, then reduction in outstanding shares, and finally dividend enhancement, the latter probably in 2025.Elliot Miller",2024-09-17
"There is absolutely nothing new here. AM management has long taken the clearly expressed view that its priorities with excess cash are, in the following order:(1) reduction of leverage, (2) reduction in the number outstanding shares, and then (3) increase of the dividend.The share price has materially increased in light of those priorities as enumerated.   Elliot Miller",2024-09-17
"Nice and to the point comment.  As a small investor in AM and being up 81% I'm a happy camper.  Certainly dividend increases are always welcome in my house, but personally buy backs would be my forte even though as previous said the current price may hinder that.  Thanks",2024-09-17
