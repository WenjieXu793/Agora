"@Contemplating Retirement Thank you for your feedback...each of us invest in our own way so if your expertise is forecasting what will happen over the next year or so, then good luck to you. I invest for the long term in that I hold stocks for 8 to 10 years. So I know that over this time period, there will be new products, new market and possibly one or two business cycles. I so look for margin of safety based on long-term perspective. If this is not your cup of tea, don't follow me.",2024-09-17

"Thank you for the article. For most of this year, USAP was my top position. I noticed you've mentioned insiders a few times in your articles, but I believe they have a poor grasp of the company. The last insider purchase I saw was back in May of last year at around $8, and since then, the stock has appreciated nearly fivefold at one point. USAP wasn’t even in my top 10 back in October/November of last year. Since then, I've added to my position at  $11, $13, $17, and even at $30 and $32 when I had available cash recently.",2024-09-12
"@PatentMan For me ? Plenty...Though my reasons(beliefs) are imbedded in years of transcripts, 10k's, and industry immersion..And along came covid..(opportunity) Shutting down this industry more than ANY other industry....11.7 year Boeing backlog. Call me when ALL the backlog evaporates...Global air traffic records and growth and DEVELOPING nations worldwide.P/E comps vs reasonably related companies at ridiculous discounts...Boing has issues ALL the time...cracks in parts, crap falling off, this and that..What if one looked at this decade(s) long fact as an opportunity ?Utilizing an open mindset in evaluation vs a closed(typical) mindset can create different possible outcomes.....Dennis O retired ... he ran company in 2007 AND 2011....What if he learned something along the way when he handing over the reins ??You rarely hear about which suppliers have more reliable products.It's my belief USAP is focused on this.(engines)Aircraft engines alone are a 91 billion a year market...Obviously, making 3-20x on investments is MORE preferred to buying poor companies simply at cheap prices, which is something 90% of 'deep value' investors do and don't even realize it...Finding the zebra that can change it's stripes or the leopard that changes it's spots is the goal, for me, in the value proposition...It can happen.Does not have to but it can.....Covid, in the long run has helped here.(imho)Do real homework, connect the dots, wishful thinking works better at the blackjack table...GLTA",2024-09-09
@Contemplating Retirement Are there any reasons to think this time (USAP run to $50+) will be any different than the last two times it got there in 2007 and 2011?  I would like to think it could get to $60 or $70 and stay there.  But history suggests at some point it will tank again.  Or asked another way….can this sort of business be long term strong and stable rather than cyclical?,2024-09-09
"@Invest_2020 I believe the company has publicly stated the next two quarters will be record quarters. If that happens , what will be the price $50? 60? 70?  What?",2024-09-09
Enough of the $30s and $40s range; this one is ready to rocket to the $50 range.,2024-09-09
