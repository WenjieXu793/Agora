"@Hunting Alpha RBRK is a partner with CRWD and MSFT is an early investor. If customers of CrowdStrike had Rubrik, they would have been up and running within hours. Rubrik is cybersecurity for your data and allows a business to get it back if a breach occurs. It’s a combination of a Symantec meets Apple Time Machine.seekingalpha.com/...",2024-10-06
@Natturner1966 What's the pitch for $RBRK? I'm not so familiar with that.,2024-10-06
Cybersecurity is setting up nicely for the medium term. I have CRWD NET RBRK. CRWD has been very good to me in the last few weeks. Sticking with it.,2024-10-05
"Nice bounce back but still pricey at $190.That said, could blow up again for multiple reason.Maybe a few long-dated OTM puts not a bad idea for a bit of protection.",2024-10-04
CrowdStrike is definitely staying at the top of Cyberspace Security companies but one more hack somewhere in North America or Europe and watch it lose all the momentum. Invest at your own risk and do your due diligence. Cheers,2024-10-04
This fake panic is over. CRWD is a best in breed company and it will stay the market leader.,2024-10-04
Bought the panic in the mid-$220s in my Roth IRA because I was looking for a quick way to increase the value of that small-ish account. Sometimes opportunities just fall into your lap.,2024-10-04
"Churn won’t be this swift. But, the case in point is not churn but the incentives that CRWD will eke out to retain customers and its impact on margins and hence the cash flows. It may be overblown or under-appreciated at the moment and coming quarters will provide a good view on estimating the impact.",2024-10-04
Time for another bounce?  I’m already loaded up to the max here. Bring it. Bullish engulfing at multi-month uptrend support. Long from $258.09,2024-10-02
"You could talk about margin expansion all you want, but that’s not what’s going to move the stock.",2024-10-01
"I was hanging on this one because I'm still ahead after the plummet...watching the comeback. This article is a compelling argument, and I think I'll unload this stock on its occasional bumps. Thanks Piotr",2024-10-01
Piggybacking off 40 analysts estimates???How many of your 40 analysts you were copying your work off of predicted the faulty software release?0/40,2024-09-29
"That’s the thing with a stock like this, there’s always that giant put option hanging overhead that something bad happens.For that reason, I would want a nice discount on a stock like this, not pay a hefty premium.",2024-09-29
@JnglstTICAL my experience using SentinelOne is very good. Time will tell if they gain significant market share.,2024-09-29
@thesteelbadger it does have weak coverage. SentinalOne isn’t a platform play at all. PANW and CRWD are the only true platform plays and since CRWD owns the end point market they have a massive advantage in the SIEM market that PANW is going after with most of the market moving from SPLK after the CSCO acquisition.,2024-09-29
I’d like to hear more information about this nine figure deal they closed.,2024-09-28
"@Victor Dergunov why do you believe what $CRWD says about its competitors? For balance, you should include what the competitors say about $CRWD!",2024-09-28
"You are correct that there were no issues on Unix platform but there were issues with MSFT OS. I hope CRWD and MFST had a productive conversation out at Redmon a few weeks ago about what they can do to improve their OS to be more resilient in certain areas. CEO went to Capitol Hill and apologized and what a non event that was. So,  I believe the stock gets back above $300 where it belongs soon. Long CRWD",2024-09-28
"Thanks for the excellent analysis and I agree with Victors ""buy"" rating. $CRWD is the leader in endpoint security, a sector poised for rapid growth on its own. The global endpoint security market is calculated at a valuation of roughly $15 billion for 2024 and is forecasted to reach approximately $35 billion by the end of 2034, with a projected CAGR of 9.2% from 2024 to 2034.",2024-09-28
"I think Crowdstrike may still lose a lot of customers. Takes time for IT departments to test, decide and roll out new solutions. I also doubt Crowdstrike are letting anyone out of their contracts. Many of which are probably 3 year. Not really acceptable, with an outage of this scale, to just wait and see if it happens again. Also interested to know where you got the idea that SentinelOne has weak coverage....",2024-09-27
