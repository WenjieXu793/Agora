@MySami it will be greatly reduced if Pooh decides to invade Taiwan. I think Putins disaster in Ukraine is giving him second thoughts.,2024-10-05
@123semi It's not in Putin's interest for him to unilaterally pull out of the Ukraine at this time..The West will have to offer Putin a plausible off ramp dealthat will allow Putin a reason to quit fighting.Putin has control of approx 20% of the Ukraine land mass.Most of it he has controlled since 2014.  Perhaps the best time to have seriously negotiated with Putin would have been 8 years ago...? As it stands now its absolutely fantasy to think Putin willexit the whole of Ukraine without Zelensky giving up someterritory to get a deal done.,2024-10-05

"@MySami really. Russia is already facing massive labor shortages amd inflation because of the lack of working age men. Drafted, fled the country or dead. You need to study Russian demographics. They are in big trouble.",2024-10-04
@2patbeth Reduce the Chinese population. Will be good for the planet,2024-10-04
"@ndardick That's a fair assessment. I'm not aware of any truly deep value picks in the defense/aerospace sector right now. As always, I appreciate your takes. Thanks for sharing.",2024-10-04
HII is a long play stock and YTD return is lacking anything of significance.  With that being said I don’t think that the customer can allow it to fail especially in this current environment.  I see a move to the up side prior to the end of the year from current levels.  Thank you for your insight on this company I find it very informative.,2024-10-04
"You will never get rich owning $hi, you’ll also never go broke.  In the event of war with China, we will lose several aircraft carriers and a lot of other ships which HI will have to replace.  It has a position in my portfolio for that reason alone…as Taiwan insurance.",2024-10-04
"Kody, the 5% undervaluation you posit is not that appealing to me, despite your 30% cumulative total return thesis through 2026.I just ran a comparative analysis of HII, LMT, RTX, LHX and GD using a tool available on Schwab. HII is the only stock in this group of aerospace/defense contractors that under-performed the S&P 500 Index over the past year. As a result, HII was left in the dust and now sports a Price/Cash Flow ratio that is half of that of the other 4. So maybe there will be a reversion to the mean that will help support your bullish thesis.Based upon my own research and analysis, I believe that the entire aerospace/defense sector is now fairly and even fully priced. Undoubtedly, the escalating conflict in the Middle East buoyed these stocks. Accordingly, I have recently sold most of them that I previously owned. The only one left in our main portfolio is RTX, although I have trimmed that stock as well.",2024-10-04
@SUE2 yes and the free world has decided to support Ukraine against fascist Russias invasion. And the Russian people are paying a terrible price for Putins ego. A terrible price. Will he continue to drive Russia to utter destruction for nothing.,2024-09-27
"Stagflation…“As Russia's GDP and inflation figures move in the wrong direction, the worst-case scenario for any economy looms large over Moscow.""There are signs of cooling domestic demand. However, there is no reduction in inflationary pressure,"" Russia's central bank said in a summary of its latest policy meeting, translated by Bloomberg.”",2024-09-27
"@StreptopeliaTurtur yes this is about rebuilding the Russian empire which equals putins ego. What has Russia accomplished for all this death and destruction. And you forget one thing in your equation. Wars have to be paid for! A few years in Afghanistan bankrupted the ussr and Russia has lost about 10x men, equipment etc in Ukraine. Plus now Russia itself is being bombed everyday. If this is what the Russian people want so be it.",2024-09-26
@repurposed graveyard of dreams Not really. The F-35 is good for what it is - designed as support for the F-22.,2024-09-26
"@Pennywise505 ""There’s also no innovation taking place in China""- not true!I watched a video of workers loading BS for amazon around forklifts and they all had flip flops on. Safety innovation! They even had a big sign in English that read ALL EMPLOYEES MUST WEAR PPE",2024-09-26

Ukraine is not capable of defending Kursk on a long term basis,2024-09-24
"@123semi Maybe, but look at what happened with nazi Germany. How much suffering until Germany was destroyed. This would have been avoided if the US, France and the UK had reacted early, and built a war economy. History is repeating and a lot of useless suffering, including the destruction of Ukraine, is going to happen until Russia is ultimately defeated. The weakness of the US and Europe will bring war in other parts of the world too. Iran is pushing its pawns, and China will follow. It's just depressing to see how the US is sending a few weapons to Ukraine in order to absolve itself, but is preventing Ukraine from acquiring efficient weapons and from using them efficiently. Very much the same in the Middle-East, where the US are sending aircraft carriers in order to prevent Israel from coping with Iran, instead of actively helping destroy the Iranian threat. These policies are allowing those regimes to get stronger and stronger and it will not end well.",2024-09-23
"@garro Agreed. Let's cancel the new carriers as being useless in a modern world:The U.S. Navy is modernizing its fleet with the Ford-class aircraft carrier, the most advanced and expensive warship ever built, costing $13 billion per unit and totaling $120 billion for the program.The F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter is the Department of Defense’s most ambitious weapons program .... the F-35 has been plagued by mounting costs and delays resulting in what some have called a staggering price tag of more than $2 trillion over several decades. (GAO report May 16 2024.)",2024-09-22
"@garro Well the Fed just cut interest rates, which is good for government borrowing and your GOP has yet to vote in the House for any more spending so don't fret life under Democrats.Worry about Ted Cruz.",2024-09-22
"@Finding Your Retirement - in the last 7.5 years, we have added over $13 trillion to the national debt.  Trump and his Congresses were responsible for $8.5 trillion of that number.  Biden and his Congresses for $4.8 trillion and climbing.  The pandemic was a major contributor, but so were Trump’s tax cuts and Biden’s spending.",2024-09-22
