@Pj90c Have you been buying the dips to get cheaper shares since your conviction is so high?,2024-10-03
"As a programmer, my investment in Cloudflare goes beyond mere financial speculation. Despite having bought in at over $120 and currently being down around 35%, I remain committed to my position. This isn't naivety; it's a conviction based on first-hand experience with their product.In the developer community, Cloudflare's reputation is top notch. I'd be hard-pressed to find a fellow programmer who doesn't appreciate their services. The quality and reliability of their offerings are simply top-notch. This widespread respect among professionals reinforces my belief in Cloudflare's long-term potential. At least that's what I believe.My investment strategy here isn't about quick gains. Instead, it's rooted in a deep understanding of the product's value and its crucial role in the internet's infrastructure. While the market may fluctuate, my confidence in Cloudflare's future stays.",2024-10-03
"@TwoFranks I was like you, but decided to buy a small number of shares today. And if the price drops on the next report I will buy more. Just maybe they will perform better than thought, but this is definitely a long term winner, providing great tools at the edge.",2024-10-03
"Have been looking at this name the last couple of months and have been waiting for a more substantial drop that hasn't come.  Will definitely wait until the next earnings report to buy, as the street hates growth companies that show even slightly slower growth y/y and I think there could be a big opportunity there.",2024-10-02

"AI Audit tool sounds interesting, but a free tool isn't much reason for excitement. -Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) shares rose 3.8% on Monday after the cybersecurity company unveiled its new artificial intelligence audit tool.-The free tool will give websites a number of new capabilities, including the ability to automatically control AI-enabled bots on their sites, something which Cloudflare Chief Executive Matthew Prince said is poised to ""dramatically change"" online content.-""Content creators and website owners of all sizes deserve to own and have control over their content,"" Prince said in a statement. ""If they don’t, the quality of online information will deteriorate or be locked exclusively behind paywalls. With Cloudflare's scale and global infrastructure, we believe we can provide the tools and set the standards to give websites, publishers, and content creators control and fair compensation for their contribution to the Internet, while still enabling AI model providers to innovate.""",2024-09-23
@Saffron Capital Looks like that rally might happen here. Those that bought that quick dip to $70 are looking good here.,2024-09-23
"Got to read more about this, but ingesting web content for AI had been free, but will not be in the future?  That sounds like it would be costly.  Also seems like the value of high quality websites, and content in general, will rise.",2024-09-23
