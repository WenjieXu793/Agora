Any other thoughts or news about the preferd shares would be appreciated.,2024-09-23
I have had other preferred shares get taken over most notably ATCO/PRH. I panicked and sold at s loss and they continued to pay. Right now it is over par.  Think I will hang on for a bit and see if the take over consortium clarifies their position. Shares are redeemable in 2028. Possible they will still pay and redeem them at the call date.,2024-09-23
"@Far Horizon good point, thank you, I will need to study the proxy asap.  BUT at any rate preferred holders will better off with the company staying public, so for us pref holders the vote should be against the takeover .",2024-09-22

"They should have given us $350 anyway. But a case could be made that its worth even more based on its PE ratio, its 52 week high was $348. Another 10% above the 52 week high would make it easier to digest.Are you saying simply voting no means you are dissenting ?Or is there other steps to be taken?",2024-09-22

"The preferred delisting has already reduced the market value substantially. This article gives a reason why the delisting of the preferred shares was needed, the aggressive management of assets. My assumption about this take private action included maintaining excellent AMBEST ratings, which would be reduced if AMBEST determined the balance sheet weakened. But the delisting of preferred shares now makes better sense to me.",2024-09-21
"Seeing commentary surrounding tslx paying or not paying the preferred. This reminds me of amtrust… at the end of the day the preferred a were delisted yet the company still pays their dividends every quarter since delisting.Insurance is a different beast.
