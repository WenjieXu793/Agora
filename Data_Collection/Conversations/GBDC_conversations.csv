@Kirk Spano In order to get back to better there may be some resistance but that bit of resistance is far better for the future than the destruction we are seeing now.,2024-10-02
@boris gudonov Every one of these investment firms have a list. Maybe they're pitching their book. They want you to buy the price up! ;-),2024-10-02
"@golfcat1 we ought to control the border, but, we ought to be issuing enough work visas and green cards to offset Boomer retirements. That requires millions of immigrants per year.",2024-10-01
Where are the latest comments....sept 20 to oct 1?  Have sold my GBDC. Need more info.,2024-10-01
@santlo It won't. Markets will tank if the weird guys take over. They are a threat to democracy and capitalism.,2024-09-30
"@erbrown Don’t bet the farm on that. I don’t see cap gain tax on unrealized gains. For openers, evaluations are impossible, not only for the likes of farm land but also for 1000 shares of a publicly-traded stock, liquidity is a big deal. Then there’s the velue of the local family business. Not so fast.",2024-09-29
Stock Market at record levels under Biden-Harris …why will change  to Trump be better for market?,2024-09-29
"@Income4ever aka Cyclenut Full disclosure:  I thought I had made this point already in my prior post but stated again, for emphasis is that I DO NOT think or believe or contemplate that GBDC's management will convert to an internally managed BDC from it's present structure of being an externally managed BDC.  It's just my belief - from the various and very financially favorable shareholder corporate actions that they have recently taken - that all of these financially favorable shareholder friendly moves seems to make GBDC act as a ""pseudo internally managed BDC company,"" even though they are and remain in truth and reality and legally, a externally managed BDC company.",2024-09-29
@koleffstephan Intresting comment. I'd say if it was to actually convert it would be fantastic.Funny there was a time when former Chairman & Ceo of Htgc tried to covert from Internal to external management and a company he formed was to be the advisor. Needless to say there was significant shareholders revolution and it never happened... Cheers,2024-09-29
"@Frank M R I am not in this thread but if you asked me, I would say, ""yes,"" I do consider GBDC's ""organisation"" (the external management team) acting and ""heading towards an internally managed company"" - and I say that because GBDC's external management team has permanently lowered all of the various fees they charge their shareholders and in essence, is attempting to simulate an internally managed BDC company.But, they are and remain, legally, an externally managed BDC company.",2024-09-29
@koleffstephan I respect that. I like having a small portion of my holdings in non USD stocks - just as a little hedge - plus with L&G you get the 8% div + div growth and stock buy backs.,2024-09-28
"@monkey's uncle Thank you for the clarification.  At this point in my investing career, I choose to invest in American domiciled companies that pay high or higher dividend payouts than Legal and General.Thanks again.",2024-09-27
"@koleffstephan I've owned Legal and General for a year or two now. 0% UK withholdings - regardless of acct type. There are, however, ADR fees if you buy the ADRs (LGGNY). Slow growth in dividends - expected ~2% growth, as I recall, going forward.",2024-09-27
"@Frank M R I see it is a company based in England and it pays dividends twice per year (like many foreign companies) and not four times per year.Do you know the taxation of dividends?  In other words, if the shares are held in a qualified retirement account (such as a SEP-IRA, by one of many examples), does a shareholder have to pay a withholding tax?",2024-09-27
@Frank M R Thank you.  I have never heard of the company and its stock.  How long have you been invested in the name?,2024-09-27
"@koleffstephan Hello, ... it depends what you are looking for. If your target is regluar safe income from a stable and trustworthy longterm business modell have a look at Legal & General with almost the same annual yield but a less ristky business modell.",2024-09-27
"@BartAtTheRanch Hello Bart, I know form your previous listings you are a fan of internally managed BDCs. Would you consider the GBDC advisory organisation as a kind of ""internally"", for it is a Golub subsidiary? I mean may other BDCs operate a similar construct but in this case it seems to me to be a '""special"" kind of relation. The advisor does not seem to ""milk the cow""!?",2024-09-27
@BartAtTheRanch suppose they see a great opportunity.  how will they invest without extra capital/debt?  so they sell stock near tbv and then borrow an equal amount.  it is how they grow.  works for me.  i have been buying on every offering.,2024-09-24
"@old maid What you say of ARCC is true, but it is also true that they were disingenuous on that call claiming no secondary offering was forthcoming (still not clear to me why they did it, but it felt wrong).As I have said before, we basically like ARCC and have held since 2009, but doubt it will be top BDC for Total Return anytime soon).Nevertheless, good luck to us!Bart",2024-09-24
"@BartAtTheRanch they regularly add capital to maintain a VERY comfortable debt/equity ratio as they grow.think of it this way:  banks are leveraged 10x1 with lending officers who are, er, salaried banking lending officers, with no skin in the game.  arcc has a debt/equity ratio of about 1x1, sharp managers and many equity kickers.  btw, i have moved out of most of my bank positions now that they are losing/ have lost their traditionally naive depositor base.",2024-09-23
