"Short term - Per the January 20, 2024 USDA chicken and egg report, broiler hatch declined y/y for every month April 2023 to December 2023 in amounts of 0% (slight decrease y/y)  to ~4%. I believe the lower hatch for the last half of 2023 has led to these good chicken prices today. For the Month January to July 2024, broiler hatch has been flat to slightly increasing y/y. Supply is an important predictor for price. Meanwhile lower feed prices encourage protein producers to feed more chickens, hogs, cattle, hens etc. which can lead to larger supply. Nothing cures high prices like high prices.Long term - Chicken remains the low-cost protein as Chickens convert feed into protein much more efficiently than beef. I too believe per capita protein intake increases for the reasons mentioned in article and view chicken as a “gateway” protein. Laying hens are also very efficient at converting feed to protein. Chicken and eggs are also perceived to be healthier than their red meat alternatives.  It's counter intuitive, but I believe high grain prices lead to disproportionately higher meat and egg prices.

"@Calvin Ott Of course, I'd take JBSAY over PPC. JBSAY is less cyclical than PPC due to its product and geographical diversification.",2024-09-15
Indeed PPC is riding on low grain costs. But isn't the parent JBSAY cheaper and less cyclical due to product and geographical diversification?,2024-09-15
