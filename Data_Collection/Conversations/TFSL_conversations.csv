"@fairmountcreek I doubt the dividend would go down. They would raise around $2.27 billion in the second step. Over time, they should be able to earn 4+% on that; around $100 million annually. Above $14.85 EOY would be a nice move from current level.",2024-09-14
@waynel7 Currently- of the 280M shares available- 53 million are issued and around 30 million are owned by institutions.Eventually there could be a second-step conversion where shares are issued wherein the dividend would likely drop but the SP would increase.Some have said to $30/share.Options issued at $14.85 almost 10 years ago are expiring in December 2024- I expect to see a SP above this level before the end of the year.I bought more this week...Keep on DRIPping.,2024-09-13
@jacobgutman @Diesel Good analysis of a widely misunderstood structure. However this statement is not accurate“the rest of the shares are just held by insiders”These shares are held by the holding company which owns the bank; not by insiders.,2024-09-12
