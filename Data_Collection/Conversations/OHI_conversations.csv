It’s all in timing. Bought 8 years ago.   Pleased with total returns.   Will hold,2024-10-06
"@Bucknfl very nice yield on cost you have, so a fair decision I think. I hope it can grow further in the future!",2024-10-06
I’m content to hold & collect OHI income since 2013.,2024-10-06
"M* has a FV of $41ish; CNN Business has market median of $39. So I would say OHI is fairly valued. However, with a yield of 6.8%, I wouldn't sell either. All the best.",2024-10-05
"Thank you very much, @grcinak, I appreciate your kind words!I will do my best to add value with future analyses as well :)",2024-10-05
"@Strategic Risk Mitigation Research I think your assessment of OHI, right here, right now... is 'spot on.'  In fact, I wholly agree with your ""strategic risk"" analysis.  This article may be the best article I have read on a specific REIT this year.  Furthermore, I have studied the dozen or so articles you have posted and I really like the way you think, and the way you present your thoughts.  So, back to OHI.  Despite the blabbering hype given to this stock since the pandemic, I avoided this one until the stock price began to show some signs of life  (pun intended) this spring.  Did I miss some upside?  Yes.  Did I avoid some downside?  Yes.My yield on cost is 7-3/4% and I view the 15% capital appreciation as a margin of safety on what I essentially consider to be a high-yield bond equivalent.  ...Which pretty much agrees with your conclusion.I really, very much, look forward to your sharing your future analyses.  And I hope that you gain many followers.  As for your prior articles, I do not disagree that MELI and PAX should each be considered as hold for different reasons, but, I'll probably incrementally add to each in my rather small ""risk bucket.""Thank you again.",2024-10-05
@Charlot- 2020 Hmmm. A shopping Center REIT. The best way to value it seems to ask questions like:What are the competitors?Does the REIT have a moat?Why does the shareprice nearly stagnate the last 10 years?What about online based competitors (Amazon...)? Can they disrupt?Only some suggestions I would ask myself. ,2024-10-04
@Jimmy Hightower Thank you! I put a purchase order at 34.00 but 30 to 33 would be even better for sure. But is it realistic to get back to those levels?,2024-10-04
@Mapache Investing I thought this would be filed. Smart move as I think the stock price is at the upper end of the range. They have options with the shelf.,2024-10-04
@Mapache Investing I added on dips but OHI & NHI pay my bills.,2024-09-18
"@Lewis Bosher It really depends on how much they would issue, but on principle, I'm not opposed to reasonable stock issuing after periods of stock growth, especially for capital-intensive companies such as REITs.",2024-09-17
@Bucknfl That's an excellent investment! I hope you also reinvested the dividends.,2024-09-17
I bought OHI in 2013 in the low 20s & have held it for the dividend. NHI is another one that has caught fire recently.,2024-09-13
Any thoughts about the company issuing stock at these levels?,2024-09-13
@Jimmy Hightower I still think there is plenty of space to grow and a pretty good dividend yield.,2024-09-12
"@Looking for value Yes, I do consider it safe, but it could be safer.",2024-09-12
"OHI resisted a dividend cut two years ago with so many more delinquent clients having to restructure and a payout about 100% (and a shareprice in the mid to upper 20s). Now that the business has stabilized, I think the dividend can be considered ""safe"".",2024-09-12
