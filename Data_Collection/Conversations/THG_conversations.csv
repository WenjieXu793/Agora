"Insurance companies are doing well. No update on Oppenheimer though with the payoff of their big loan last week. They're obviously still buying shares back until the end of this month.

Besides another $3 this quarter, that's another 100 million in their pockets in the next few months",2024-09-29 00:00:00.000000
