"Revisiting CSL, intraday, I am now up 100% in CSL.  This is a stock I bought because of articles I read about CSL in late 2022 and early 2023.  While I accumulated the stock over a six month period, my accumulation was finished by late spring, 2023.  There aren't many stocks I own that reach 100% unrealized gain within a year and a half.  This stock has been a big winner.  Moreover, it presently features a strong buy quant.  Thanks again, Leo.  Your article was one those that I read that convinced me to buy CSL.",2024-10-08 11:36:40.805492
@Kirk Spano In order to get back to better there may be some resistance but that bit of resistance is far better for the future than the destruction we are seeing now.,2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
@boris gudonov Every one of these investment firms have a list. Maybe they're pitching their book. They want you to buy the price up! ;-),2024-10-02 00:00:00.000000
"@golfcat1 we ought to control the border, but, we ought to be issuing enough work visas and green cards to offset Boomer retirements. That requires millions of immigrants per year.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
@santlo It won't. Markets will tank if the weird guys take over. They are a threat to democracy and capitalism.,2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@erbrown Don’t bet the farm on that. I don’t see cap gain tax on unrealized gains. For openers, evaluations are impossible, not only for the likes of farm land but also for 1000 shares of a publicly-traded stock, liquidity is a big deal. Then there’s the velue of the local family business. Not so fast.",2024-09-29 00:00:00.000000

"Hey good article here! TTM CSL has bought back 7% of the company! One thing to also mention is their “vision 2030” where they expect to make $40+ of adj. EPS , a 20x multiple on that would be $800 but that’s in 2030! They also have free cash flow to sales of 15% , so for every $100 of total revenue they get $15 of that is free cash flow that they can do crazy buybacks and dividend with:) or more synergistic acquisitions",2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
@slodon28 of course it will - just ask Milton Friedman. Spending leads to inflation (Why I sold any bond holding/ blended fund before 2022). Don't make this so hard.,2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
@TJ Burke Wont all of that NEW that government spending increase inflation?,2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
Spending will take off again under Harris. All her initiatives require new spending. It's objective reality and your lack of policy awareness or shallow partisanship does not change it.,2024-09-15 00:00:00.000000

@TripLiars Can you name 1 Republican who supports this unrealized capital gains tax?,2024-09-12 00:00:00.000000
@slodon28 I saw it on some news article and most high profile donors have assured it is not going to happen,2024-09-11 00:00:00.000000
@Dr.Div63 Actually there was demand for gas since Trump put 16+ million people back to work from April 2020 to Jan. 2021.,2024-09-10 00:00:00.000000
@Simon Chatham We need the record pumping oil numbers in order to refill the millions and millions of barrels of crude Biden sold China out of the US Defense Reserves.,2024-09-10 00:00:00.000000
What about $GEO? They could help Trump operate his moves against the unliked foreigners.,2024-09-10 00:00:00.000000
"@Brucejfern Having owned $MAIN, $ARCC, $OBDC, etc., in the past, I now think $PBDC or $BIZD (the ETFs with nice dividends) is the best way to participate in this sector. Spread the risk. Pay a little extra in fees. Sleep well at night. Remember to hold this in a tax deferred account since these dividends ARE NOT qualified.",2024-09-10 00:00:00.000000
@Simon Chatham  Fact checking will show you are correct in the record amount of oil being pumped. Just shows what distraction can do to people's perception. Edit: forgot link.www.eia.gov/...,2024-09-10 00:00:00.000000
