@StockJabber.com It's going to take a pile of inflation before I'm worried about joining the centimillionaires club.  Is it worth considering that right now it is a proposal and not coming for you in January 2025?,2024-10-04
"@Skagit another reason for Dell and Peter Thiel sell off is , due to election winners. Who knows what percentage will increase for tax gains and on the top of that , us deficit is growing . The only way to fund is to increase taxes Everyone make contributions to ROTH 401k and ROTH IRA Storm is coming with taxes in near future",2024-10-04
"@StockJabber.com dumping shares as its opportunity to do that now, later will be too late. If he believes that shares will cost much more after one year - there is no point to unload 20M shares.",2024-10-04

"@Jlagreen isn't using nvidia gpu for inference is like using a cannon to kill a fly ? During the training, you load a mini-batch of data into the GPU ram, and perform both forward and backpropagation.For inference, rather, you have much more inference requests at same time (thinking about millions of people making query on GPT). That is to say, you need load a much much larger batch of input data into the ram and perform forward only. This changes the architecture, and GPU isn't optimized for inference.",2024-10-04
"@Hermann Balck There's all kinds of reasons he could be selling his shares including age and/or health. ""Wants no more part of it"" is certainly not one of them.",2024-10-04
"So explosive the founder, ceo, and chairman wants no more part of it and is cashing out in a big way.",2024-10-04
@Henrich0807 Nvidia!Why? Because all the training data center can be used for inferencing as well.That's why competition has such a problem. Nobody buys 2 data centers. It's like you would get several cars for different purposes and switch when you need it while you could also look for 1 car being able to do good in several tasks.,2024-10-04
I believe in Dell and I believe in Michael Dell. This company is another great way to participate in the AI revolution.,2024-10-03

@Phantom II X Check YOUR math!!  20M sold/will sell vs 18.3M keeping.......this is 3rd grade math.,2024-10-01
Thank You for the article. I recently bought DELL at an average cost of $99.82 and I'm holding.,2024-10-01
That's a nice payday. I own it and I'll stick with it for now.,2024-10-01
"@StockJabber.com To be fair, and let's assume Mr. Dell is far richer than all of us put together, his shares have been propelled by the inference that EVERYONE needs new servers, stat.  I don't even know what stat means, but something like instantaneously.   NVDA was my largest holding and now, not.  I bought SMCI before NVDA and am waiting until after the smoke clears.  Gracias.Does he know for sure where the trend is going?  ""For sure"" is a relative term when you are talking X billions of $.  Some founders insist on buying every dip and others spot the times when the apples are good to harvest even though the future is a coin toss.NVDA will provide the ink for this rally. Or not.  Dell will either be a genius or ... well, he's worth billions.  How y'all doin?",2024-10-01
@CajunCal @Fundamental Trader Good points by both. I think $DELL management has also talked about a more optimistic outlook on the PC cycle side.,2024-10-01
"@omghcarman Thanks for reading. Given my range-bound outlook on $DELL, I think covered calls make sense.",2024-10-01
If it falls tomorrow I'm picking up some shares.   Hmm wonder what the options will look like as well.   This doesn't bother me at all.   Agree he is making himself a billionaire for real just not on paper.   You really never know what lies around the corner.   And who knows maybe he has things he wants to do with the money.,2024-10-01
@S_Archer Obviously he is free to do whatever he wants.  The question is what are other current Dell stock holders going to do.  Obviously been a good year so far.,2024-09-30
"@dandroidz No it simply means on the particular day you mentioned, DELL had many more sellers than buyers and SMCI had the opposite. I am of the opinion that the price of a stock is determined in a similar fashion as the oddsmakers establish a point-spread for an NFL game. The goal of the oddsmakers is to get equal action on both sides of a bet and will adjust the line one way or the other if the betting gets too lopsided in either direction. The stock market is the same .... if DELL has 10 sellers to every 1 buyer for whatever reason .... the stock will fall to the point where there becomes roughly 5 sellers for each 5 buyers. Bottom line .... after a big run up the day before, too many people decided to take profits in DELL compared to buyers and the same day there were simply more buyers of SMCI than there were sellers after a big drop the previous day. But I'm sure you understand all of this already.",2024-09-30
"Ouch huge sell off, 20 M sold and holding only another 18 M shares, what is this guy doing",2024-09-30
