"Two words: Total Return.Over the last 10 years:LYB: 38.7%SPY (S&P 500): 400%Like many ""income"" stocks you will get subpar results buying this stock anywhere near the current price. That said, this has been a very profitable stock to own when it drops below $80/share in economic downturns because it is well run and the downturns have been followed by impressived equity gains in the stock, that and the subsequent yield on cost make better math for your portfolio.",2024-09-24
"@rlp2451 ya it traded (past tense 2022) with oil stocks, now they have no refining. Sold their refining early due to USG excessive regulation. Those profits are gone, they vary a lot, read about crack spreads. So in 2022 the crack spreads were huge. The price was justified imo. Now in Bidenomics energy demand has greatly slowed as the policies intended.I bought some at 45 in 2020 but most before that. Buy mid 80s to 78., I’ve done it many times. Sell over 100. Long over 5 years a top 10 position for 5 year plus.LYB has a lot headwinds (climate, China, anti USA energy policy, etc) I’m not selling it or growing it now. Let it drip.Good review author, thx!",2024-09-21
