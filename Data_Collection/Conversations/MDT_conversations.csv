"If $MDT hits $100, I will exit it. It's a boring underperformer and boring not in a good way. It is a chronic underperformer, a bit like $CSCO. Nothing it does ever excites the market. YTD, S&P500 is up 20% while MDT has done 9%. Huge performance gap. Over the year, S&P 500 is up 32%, MDT up 12%.Over 5 years S&P 500 is up 90% while MDT is down 18%. Pathetic.Avoidable stock.",2024-09-25

"Thorough analysis. I bought MDT opportunistically last Fall and sold it in our main account when it ran up 30% from my entry price. However, I bought MDT for my 3 granddaughters and my mother-in-law a couple of years ago, and they still own MDT. It is doing perfectly fine for them, so I have no reason to sell it in their accounts. I have been focusing on creating a more concentrated but nonetheless diversified portfolio that I have recently whittled down from 34 to26 stocks.On deck for me is tonight's earnings report and guidance on MU, which is our 9th largest holding.",2024-09-25

"This is an excellent article on MDT.You can invest in the medical devices space through MDT, BSX, JNJ or even ABT, but MDT is the best pure play with the highest dividend yield in the group that also sells at the lowest Price/Cash Flow ratio in the group.I also look at what CFRA says, and I can say that both Morningstar and Refinitiv (formerly Reuters) are also constructive on MDT. Morningstar has a Fair Value Estimate of $112 on MDT.My 3 granddaughters have each owned MDT for years!",2024-09-16
