"@Stephen Simpson Another interesting name is ITGR, medical device contract manufacturer/parts supplier. I am on the sidelines presently waiting for a pullback......and keep waiting.......but is is high on my watchlist.  Got an entry on AORT thanks for suggesting that one!",2024-09-28
"@Stephen Simpson yes, been accumulating STVN around $19.  Broken down this year due to China exposure and revised '24 guide in Aug due to increase in expenses and supply delays. Mgt expects vial orders recovery by end of '24.  Generally not a interested in most EU names but this and LMAT have been the rare exceptions.Another Medical Packaging name which I really like is UFPT.  Too expensive currently  but if it pulls back one to keep on the watch list.",2024-09-20
