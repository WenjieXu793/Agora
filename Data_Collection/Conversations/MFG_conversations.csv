"looks like little muskie shot off his mouth and got the attention of the secret service, lol""Elon Musk, the rightwing Tesla CEO, made an inflammatory post on X asking why no one had targeted Joe Biden or Kamala Harris.Bloomberg News sought records from the Secret Service regarding Musk’s tweet, and if it was being investigated for it. What the outlet received in response isn’t quite definitive, but does indicate that the agency was aware of what he said:The Secret Service investigates when they’re trying to determine whether a person poses an imminent threat to one of their protectees. Threatening the US president or vice president is a felony that can carry a hefty fine or up to five years in prison.FOIA Files sent Freedom of Information Act requests to the Secret Service’s Protective Intelligence and Assessment Division, Office of Protective Operations and Office of Investigations for documents and emails referencing Musk’s post.On Wednesday, the agency responded to the requests by saying records it has about Musk’s post were “compiled for law enforcement purposes” and are being withheld because “disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.”We followed up with the Secret Service’s FOIA division and were told that the Protective Intelligence Division advised that it cannot release any records because of “enforcement proceedings.”The agency “is aware of the social media post made by Elon Musk,” said Nate Herring, a spokesperson for the Secret Service. “As a matter of practice, we do not comment on matters involving protective intelligence. We can say, however, that the Secret Service investigates all threats related to our protectees.” """,2024-09-19
"@osv1 The antitrust laws address more than price fixing.  This was clearly a group boycott.  If you knew anything about antitrust, you would see that it is pretty much the definition of a group boycott. It will be up to the appellate courts to decide if it was legal or not.",2024-09-18
"@Ed Grey Damages are easily provable from lost ad rev's.  Collusion is established by the fact they had a group set up with the express purpose of cancelling advertising.  The reason is obvious.  If a few companies cancelled ads but others continued, then the ones cancelling would be at a marketing disadvantage.  The conspiracy only worked if there was concerted action.  That's kind of the whole point of the antitrust laws, to prohibit concerted action or conspiracies to restrict trade.",2024-09-18
"@BakkenPro this has nothing to do with price fixing and it's not a ""group boycott"", the media group proved that twitter was putting their advertisers ads up beside racist right-wing extremist trash posts.it's funny how you people ignore actual relevant facts when making posts... as i stated earlier, little muskie has already been dinged in court for his behavior:""Musk tried to ‘punish’ critics, judge rules, in tossing a lawsuitIn a win for hate-speech researchers, a federal judge in California dismisses X’s lawsuit under the state’s anti-SLAPP law.A federal judge in California on Monday threw out the entirety of a lawsuit by Elon Musk’s X against the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), ruling that the lawsuit was an attempt to silence X’s critics.""it's funny how some posters out here think that it's o.k. for a billionaire to use his unlimited wealth to destroy democracy and free speech.",2024-09-18

"@eugene_ And it's not like they'll go back to advertising there.I wonder how it would do in a hypothetical IPO. Probably much better with some steadier, independent CEO in place, and Musk out of the management.",2024-09-17
"@osv1 Fidelity's valuation is less than the $13 billion loan amount. Maybe the banks could repossess Twitter and do an IPO. I suppose their collateral is only a portion of the $44 billion purchase price, though.",2024-09-17
"@flashgordon74 ""Elon said F U to the advertisers who demanded censorship""wrong, the advertisers who bailed out of x got sued by elon, that's NOT free speech, it's elon trying to control what people say about x, he is the one imposing censorship and he's lost lawsuits because of exactly that.it's amazing how tRump voters can distort reality like that.",2024-09-11
@Kinrex Elon said F U to the advertisers who demanded censorship. All Elon wants is free speech. He is strongly against the Communist censorship of speech and and ideas. Which if you think about it-we all should be against.  If you yourself want a filtered platform -take your pick.,2024-09-11
