China has apparently gone back to buying Boeing Aircraft is the rumor which of course can't happen because of the strike going on there which no one talks about. Long $f Ford Motor Company strong buy as isn't the labor issue now correctly resolved Morgan Stanley? Be nice to see both Ford and Stellantis join with GM in their rollout of charging infrastructure as Tesla starts pulling back from....does Tesla even have sales in North America currently? They don't act like they do anymore. Might have a free battery electric vehicle facility in North Carolina soon as well which if true sounds bullish for *SOMEBODY* in the automotive sector. HondaJet doing great in North Carolina as well is the rumor anyways. Not sure what Gulfstream is up to these days in response to that. Cirrus, Eclipse, IconA5 know what those are up to though as they with HondaJet all represent the future of flight for the USA certainly. Is the FAA going to attack all of these businesses too? What is the FAA *""AI""* plan anyways? Have they put out a bid for having a commercial aircraft voice assistant that they can interface with? Amazon and Apple I'm sure would love to help with that, right?",2024-09-26

@rowenco - Share count is down to 303.8M and trading at a current PE of 11.06X. The consumer discretionary sector is still out of favor at this time. I continue to accumulate.,2024-09-14
