"Very little resistance until it hits 42.  Still yields 6.3%.  They own commercial real estate where the cities and states are seeing population growth.  Money markets, and bond yields will be yielding less over the next 18 or so months.  Who knows if things go well, they may even increase their dividend.  I'm very pleased with HIW and expect more upside.",2024-09-09
"@ConnorGraham - totally agree and have used covered calls, as an income investor, why would you sell this in the current environment for REIT's. Especially with the above average dividend yield in a decreasing rate environment .",2024-09-09
Yes...I got out when it hit 30... we'd gotten the great bulk of the value out of this one...time to move on whenever the capital involved can be put to a more opportune use.,2024-09-09
Virtually all my reits are up. Time to sit back & enjoy the dividends. Some are up crazy like ADC WELL IRM.,2024-09-09
"@ConnorGraham that always requires 100 shares, which I don’t have on many stocks.I sold CC for example last year on Kroger, before realizing it was in my top 10 highest holdings, sb 15 - 20, I own 50 & can’t imagine below 40.Hard to keep your allocations proper, at least for me with my Ave holding about 2% of my total stocks.Keep half or more in funds & ETFs.",2024-09-09
"The gain has been really surprising after owning for almost 2 years.Almost sound’s to me like aa sell, but a 6.34% yield is hard to come by.Any good trades ?   Will have to think about this one.",2024-09-09
"Thanks for the update.  I have a nice gain but don't plan on closing the position.  I will hold, collect dividends and use that for other opportunities.",2024-09-09
"@GuyRien1 Simply the opportunity cost of sitting back and passively collecting a dividend when the upward capital gain potential (the primary reason for originally identifying it as cheap) has been largely if not fully realized. There are always other fish in the sea...even as you correctly note that we may be in calmer seas than previous more volatile conditions. There may not be as many or as obvious a catch as say HIW once was, but there is always opportunity. May have been a tad premature but I was happy to ride HIW for over 10 dollars a share and judged it time to let it out to pasture. BTW, I believe YOC to be a misleading metric...in order to properly assess the wisdom of switching or remaining with an investment (assuming yield is the decisive consideration) one needs to compare the current yield provided by your holding with that currently available from other alternative uses of your capital.",2024-09-01
"@CincinnatiRick But I don't see that volatility happening any more going forward. In the last four years it's being one event after the other creating amazing buying opportunities. The entire market in 2020, energy in 2021, EU banks in 2022, regional banks in 2023 etc. But I think we are back to boring so I'm holding onto HIW. It's in my Roth so paying a nice 10+% on cost so I'm happy.If you think otherwise, I'd like to understand why.",2024-09-01
@crusingwithjess I also got another 20. It's a high-quality company one of the few read that did not cut its dividend at all through the entire early 2020s,2024-08-31
I bought this on 10/30/2023 for $17.70!  I'm up over 80% in price alone with a yield near double digits on cost (no idea what it is). I have to hold or else I'm liable for a sizeable short term capital gain.,2024-08-31
"@GuyRien1 ""Is there something I'm missing here that they could cut the dividend or worse?"" Not at all...if that were to happen, it would be a freak accident. The obvious downside when you have a fairly quick run-up is the opportunity cost of failing to redeploy your capital in something promising that has yet to appreciate. As I put it: ""There are other fish in the sea and, when you have got the easy money out of any stock or option, it makes sense to reel it in and cast again."" Now, you could miss further upside but chances are it is already a spent force. Don't get me wrong, I'm very much a dividend investor but not at all too proud to pick up capital gains...it all spends the same.",2024-08-27
@CincinnatiRick I got in under $20 so I'm happy. But why not hold and collect dividends? Is there something I'm missing here that they could cut the dividend or worse?,2024-08-27
@Alex_13 So why not hold and accumulate? Do you think there's a chance that they will cut the dividend or something worse?,2024-08-27
