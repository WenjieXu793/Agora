"@Izzyrules Smuckers was never owned by P&G, Smuckers purchased P&G Brands: Folger's Coffee, Jif Peanut Butter, Crisco Oil then sold it.  Smuckers stock was swap in the purchase of these brands.",2024-09-03
I wish they bought FLO or bought a large stake in FLO vs. Hostess,2024-09-02
"Small position but consistently frustrating: just when you see improvement in the share price, something is done to knock it back. Family is still in management with C.E,O,, a Smucker, but I wonder what proportion is family-owned. Good if they have their own money at stake.",2024-08-31
"The Hostess purchase is one of those that will take time to come to fruition, but will be valuable in the long run. Donuts will be with us for quite some time. And SJM now has the king of these type of desert snacks.",2024-08-31
"This gem on Strawberry lane in Orville Ohio is one of those forever holds of you’re a long term dividend investor. Its CEO is a Smucker as it always has been since their founding over 100 years ago. This family is serious about shareholder value. If the price gets back to 106, I’m ready to add on. In the meantime, I’ll have a cup of Folgers and a Twinkie while I wait.",2024-08-31
"PE forward at around 12 is the lowest since 2009. Slow growth estimated for the next few years. Good support at around 109-111. My only hesitation is the dividend yield, at around 3.5% with growth at 2-4%. Free cash flow easily covers the dividend, but it's measly. www.tradingview.com/...",2024-08-28
"@zball Agreed, although I think the fall from $160 to $110 after overpaying for Hostess is an appropriate discount.  They now need to show that they can generate solid earnings from the assets they have.",2024-08-28
It guy a lot cheaper today. Have a Twinkie or snowball investors,2024-08-28
"@Izzyrules SJM spun from P&G?? Amazing, P&G use to be everything America!",2024-08-28
"@zball Steady income, forever brands/products I like and use. Stock price right now is average/reasonable. I'm not going to actively add to my minor position, but not going to sell either. Not a make or break bet for me, but just one of many different holdings. I'm happy to hold SJM, hopefully forever.",2024-08-28
"@zball Nah, I agree with you. I received SJM shares after it spun off from P&G. While it has been a decent dividend provider it really can't seem to get out of its own way when it comes to operations and having too many cooks in the kitchen. Funnily enough P&G had the same issues a while back which is why it spun off Smuckers in the first place. Hopefully they refocus and get back to what they are good at.",2024-08-28
"@zball No, you've got it right. It's on my list to likely sell if there is a nice ""pop!"" in price at some point. It's just too slow and the dividend doesn't make up for the very slow growth.  Bottom line; too much juggling and weak growth. Result? It's a HOLD (at best).Prost!",2024-08-28
"This company just can’t seem to get it right.  Too many moving pieces.  Always integrating this, divesting that.   Need to stop the shell game and concentrate on operational excellence.  I’m losing my patience with this company. I welcome any dissent.",2024-08-28
