"@Dollarsandcents sounds good. Yeah, there is some projecting required for this one, but I'm confident in the continued user growth and ai efficiencies.",2024-09-30
"@Michael B Howard - I think I found the error in my reasoning.  The $11.89 for Meta was in fact the average revenue (not profit) per person.  However, that was for just Q2 (and not TTM).  For the last 4 quarters, that came out to $46.55.  Therefore a $20 average revenue per person for PINS is plausible but, my guess is probably 3-4 years out",2024-09-30
"@Dollarsandcents it was profit per user, not revenue.Meta will make probably 120B in EBIT+R&D in the next 12 months, on a user base of 5-6B. That's 20 bucks in earnings per user. Many of those platforms are unmonetized, meaning the longer term figure could be 30 or more per user.I think it's unknown where long term earnings per user could fall, but 20/user is Meta's rate without AI, and there are some advantages Pinterest has over Meta.Even if it's only $5/user/year in profit,  after AI efficiencies, let's assume 1B users by early 2030s and a 20x multiple. That's 100B in market cap against a current 20B in EV.",2024-09-30
"Your per user revenue of $20 seems unrealistic especially given ROW makes up such a large portion of total users.  Also, META's average revenue per user is just $11.89.It is highly unlikely that the DOJ/FTC would allow any of the big tech companies to buy PINS.Long PINS",2024-09-30
"Great summary! I recently sat on a sales call with their sales team recently as part of my business and all of your points about the value vs other social media are on point. One thing they also mentioned was that Pinterest was also for planners, think along the lines of weddings, anniversary, party's etc. The average user is very engaged and looking for inspiration. This leads to longer use times as well as higher click rates to paying advertisers online stores. The team I spoke with understood engagement, was well informed, responsive and presented a good value proposition to me as a potential paid advertiser. I have owned Pinterest in the past and benefited from the last run, I really enjoyed you article and am going to take a second look as I add positions moving forward.",2024-09-29
Great article. PINS is an under appreciated company which makes it a great investment. Long.,2024-09-29
"@Jlexus1953 I am happy with cautious rollout of monetization. Because ads deter new users, and getting into the 1B user arena is a more valuable goal in terms of monetization than monetizing now with only half that, and delaying the bigger prize.On GPUs, I would hope they do spend more on GPUs in order to increase content quality to the individuals unique interests. This is the cause of their expenses doubling under Bill, which is an asset. It's 3 billion cash pile is a lawsuit buffer and will pretty much always have to stay there, as is seen with dozens of other international tech conglomerates. I think stock buybacks will make sense once they have won the prize in their field: 1) 1B users, and growth has slowed to a crawl 2) AI has connected the best content with users, allowing monetization without forcing it. 3) pinterest has developed a second and complimentary revenue stream. Without that, share buybacks should be on the back burner for now, in my opinion.Thanks for your comment!",2024-09-29
Pinterest is an interesting company with obvious growth potential but has experienced difficulties in monetization. Moreover their expense have more than doubled since Bill Ready took over offsetting its growth and hampering the stock price. Pinterest has around 3 billion in cash which is way too much and should institute a stock buyback,2024-09-29
"@Natturner1966 -Oppenheimer initiated coverage of Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) with an ""Outperform"" rating on Tuesday. They think the company's platform is lending itself well to direct response advertising and believe investments in engagement and monetization will drive upside to long-term investor estimates, helped by its more than 500 million monthly users.-The research firm noted that while PINS's DAU base is the smallest among social media companies, they see upside to engagement. They also view the company's valuation as attractive at 12x EBITDA.",2024-09-25

"Deutsche Bank on $PINS (Buy; PT $43): ""We initiate coverage of Pinterest. We view Pinterest as an under-monetized, scaled, increasingly personalized 'digital catalog' that attracts an affluent, high purchase-intent user base."" ""The platform’s ability to support users from inspiration to purchase is making Pinterest increasingly indispensable for full-funnel advertisers. Pinterest’s value proposition is supported by the fact that 90% of its product searches are unbranded, allowing advertisers to reach high-intent consumers early in the buying process."" ""Looking ahead, we expect further expansion into adjacent categories, driving user growth and engagement (modeling a 6% Global MAU CAGR, with an upside case of 9% CAGR from FY24-26). We anticipate that ramped down-funnel product velocity will support ARPU growth, alongside favorable international ARPU tailwinds driven by 3P demand and re-seller partnerships."" ""Overall, we model revenue growth of 18% over the next 3 years, modestly above consensus, with an upside scenario yielding a 25% revenue CAGR. With operational discipline and gross margin tailwinds, we model Adj. EBITDA margins expanding by 11 points over our forecast period, with our upside case adding an additional 3 points. Applying a FY26E EV/EBITDA multiple of 17x, below the peer group average of 20x, supports our $43 target, and we believe PINS' top line and margin characteristics could potentially justify a premium valuation multiple.""
