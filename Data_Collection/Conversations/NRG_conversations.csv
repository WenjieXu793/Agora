It went up 14% since this review. Is this review still valid?,2024-08-31
@gastro4 40% I think (don't quote me on this) but this includes Vivint revenue.,2024-08-29
@Noah's Arc Capital Management thanks for quick  reply. What % of their revenue is outside Texas?,2024-08-29
@gastro4 Yes but I focused on Texas because this is where the growth is. I think the non-Texas part should be relatively stable,2024-08-29
@ski2nite The forward multiple is super cheap compared to sector median what 'hope' are you referring to?,2024-08-27
I think NGR is over priced. The stock is in up 122% so trading on is hope rather results,2024-08-27
@1TurboTrader I agree that the economy might be slowing but the state is still benefiting from net migration which should help hold up construction,2024-08-27
