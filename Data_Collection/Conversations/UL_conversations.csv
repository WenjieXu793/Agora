I bought UL in 2005 & put it away & collected the dividends. It’s had a good run this year.,2024-09-27
@Bluemountain1 thanks for your comment! I think especially the sale of the ice cream business will push them forward because it is low growth business with only 15% operating margin. To reach the goals bij 2025 or 2026 execution of the plans has to be (near to] perfect and no additional substantial external headwinds should arise.,2024-09-26
"Thank you for your detailed analysis! I share your measured optimism regarding Unilever’s transformation. It's clear that they have made strategic moves since Nelson Peltz’s intervention, particularly with targeted acquisitions and divestitures like the sale of the tea business. However, it’s interesting to note that while revenue has nearly reached the goal, the profit margins are still struggling to improve as expected. This indicates that more work needs to be done to maximize efficiency and close the gap with P&G. I'm curious to see how the optimization of the 30 key brands and the spin-off of the ice cream division will affect future results. Do you think these measures will be enough to bridge the gap with P&G by 2025 or 2026, especially in an uncertain economic environment?",2024-09-26
