@Bill the Bag Man agree.  At a macro level the weekly summary that would be somewhat useful would be the number of companies that reported positive earnings growth or revenue growth net inflation.  Of which I think only CCL did.  Would need to check.  But otherwise not a very helpful metric.,2024-10-05
Do companies ever really guide earnings very high? No. They guide on the conservative cautious side. Usually that is why an equity tanks if they miss or guide lower. Nothing earth shattering and it is not saying much about the macro economic picture.,2024-10-05
"@ndardick You are probably right that KHC is a bit undervalued at present relative to CAG.  Equivalent dividends and payouts.  KHC, according to analysts, LOL, has somewhat better growth prospects.  I have a modest allocation to consumer staples and increased weighting early this year.  Bought into TSN, and ADM on bad news.  So far so good.  Maybe LW is a bit overdone with the recent sell off.  I also like PEP, KOF and HSY in the food sector.  I always look forward to your comments, which I generally find to be well considered.",2024-10-03
"@usiah At current prices, KHC seems to be a better choice than CAG.",2024-10-03

"I traded Conagra successfully earlier in the year, and am prepared to get back in at $28.",2024-10-02
Thanks author for the great article. Agree with the analysis. I would apply the 3-day and 1-week rules before initiating a position. I believe the stock price can still downtrending to the $28 range.,2024-10-02
"@NextGenInvest On concensus eps estimates,  CAG is selling  for less than 12X calendar 2025 eps est.",2024-10-02
Crashed today and may get cheaper tomorrow. If it hits 25-26 load up.,2024-10-02
It may get cheaper tomorrow. It’s a screaming buy at 25.00.,2024-10-02
"""Stop loss $25.""A 4% dividend seems great but an 8% loss today alone ate up 2 years of dividends. CAG has exceptional products but the damage from inflation caused by extremely excess govt spending the last 3.8 years has crippled all food and beverage stocks. LW is no better off. Bets would likely favor the $25 stop loss verses the desired small profits. Good govt policy helps Americans.  Bad govt policy destroys companies and Americans jobs.",2024-10-02
"I didn’t overthink and started an underweight position this morning. Thanks for the article.Best,Daniel",2024-10-02
"@Hunting Alpha FWIW, SA has a listing of 55 packaged foods and meats stocks compiled at seekingalpha.com/...There are probably some good ideas lurking in that list. I haven't done a review of possible opportunities in this area for quite awhile.",2024-10-02
"@Hunting Alpha Remember the 3-day rule. Give things a few market days to settle out. It might look significantly different than, one way or the other, than it does right now.",2024-10-02
"@Hunting Alpha At the moment, I am holding DOLE and also UL, which is partly a food stock.  I have trimmed my PEP but continue to hold a modest position.I previously held a position in LW but sold that when I sensed trouble on the horizon.  With their current pullback, they might be worth considering again. COLD and LINE are important pieces of the food supply chain, and I am watching both of them for good buying opportunities. And I hold a modest position in SYY.  I have also held positions in USFD, UNFI, and KR in the past, with various levels of positive results.I also have a solid position in LAND. Food has to come from somewhere, and I like LAND's focus on farmland for permanent food crops rather than bulk agricultural commodities.  The monthly dividend also puts a smile on my face every time it comes in.",2024-10-02
@Chris Lau $UNFI 5yr stock chart is kind of ugly. Forward PE of 41. What are you seeing that I'm missing?,2024-10-02
Buy CAG for the steep food discount and UNFI for the bigger returns.,2024-10-02
Long CAG and hope it sinks to 25.00. I’ll double my position,2024-10-02
@Gregory Holter I like that assessment. Which other food-related stocks do you own?,2024-10-02
"@Gregory Holter I should clarify that I don't dislike CAG at all, and we use some of their products in our home. I was just fortunate to get in at a good price and I don't mind taking profits and moving on. I have other food-related stocks that I am also reviewing to see whether I should add or trim at the current time. They all have their different strengths and weaknesses.Predicting consumer behavior at times like this is a pretty risky business. There are a lot of different uncertainties to think about. And there are also supply chain issues to consider.",2024-10-01
