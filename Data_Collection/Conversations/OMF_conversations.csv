"@Utterly Confused Your skepticism about the business of non-prime consumer lending is shared by many, and it's likely the reason why the stock is so consistently cheap and offers such a solid dividend yield.Non-prime consumer lending is a large and vital industry that serves a significant portion of Americans.  OneMain's customers are primarily hard working people with jobs in relatively stable industries who are in need of credit.OneMain Financial is the best run company in the business and has been around for a very long time.  They do an excellent job of underwriting and are aligned with their customers; it is in their best interest that they only offer loans that are affordable to those who apply (this is very different from the ""payday loan"" industry).  OneMain is prudently managed and the company has stated it expects to remain profitable even in a recession similar to the Great Financial Crisis.",2024-10-08 11:55:08.300287
"@Utterly Confused I probably understand to a certain extent as I was a large holder until covid hit and my interest died as I went negative overnight and while I hung on for a while, I sort of set time limits for recovery and when it does not appear take the loss and move on.   So, starting a position in ""O"" having as we emerged from covid and feeling good about that move only to enter the high inflation era and finally jumped out.  Many thought what I did was foolish and retried it again and that lasted until Oct of 23 and I sold it out and again jumped into MAIN and coming back into MAIN with a CB of $40.78 I am quite pleased, and did I go back to ""O""?  The answer is NOOnly have 1 REIT and that is SPG.  I did of course have other BCD's when I started my MAIN buy as I now own FDUS, CSWC, FSK, TRIN, HTGCall in positive territory",2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"@Lonestar Aruba Yep, timing matters. There's a saying about bearish investors: early but right is still wrong.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"@Utterly Confused You maybe on to something in the longer run, but currently it has a buy rating by Wall St., though its momentum rating is down which could be of concern, though I might add that the company has been around since the 1920’s…trading is also a possibility…GL",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
"I'm genuinely baffled by investors' interest in OneMain Holdings, even with the dividend yield. It looks like a falling knife. I know that OneMain was a big winner in 2023 and perhaps investors love it because it did well for them in the past. I wonder if private equity is eyeing them for a takeover, because that's the only bull case I can see right now.Even if OneMain is able to remain profitable by charging 30%+ interest rates on newly originated loans, how can one get excited about a company that lends to nonprime borrowers in a higher for longer environment? Rates are still restrictive. These borrowers have always struggled and there aren't many signs that this will change, as evidenced by steadily increasing delinquency rates on consumer loans over the past 2 years. During its July 2024 earnings call, Capital One noted that they set aside $3.9 billion in provisions for loan losses, up from $2.5 billion the year before. Even Visa missed earnings last July (earnings may have since been revised upward to ""met""), citing ""slight moderation in the lower-spend consumer segment."" Visa hadn't missed earnings since 2020.And although people have started refinancing their mortgages after the Fed reduced interest rates in September, how many of OneMain's borrowers could actually afford a mortgage in the first place?Then we have the September jobs report. Although it was positive in the aggregate and the unemployment rate decreased, most increases in hiring were for low-income professions (e.g., food and beverage services, home health care services).I just don't understand the enthusiasm for a company that provides loans to financially distressed clients going into year 2 of a restrictive rate environment, even if rates go back to neutral. I truly don't get it.Then again, I'm new to investing and a pessimist and a fool, so I'm almost certainly wrong.",2024-10-05 00:00:00.000000
