A list of dividend stocks without the dividend percentages is not helpful. It took a lot of wasted time to click back and forth to get the individual dividend rates.,2024-10-03
"I will add Resources Connection (RGP) to the list.RGP is debt-free, cash-rich, pays 6% dividend, while also being very cheap, based on all the key multiples.",2024-10-03

"@Curonian Research All investing involves risk, but if an individual pays attention the risk is reduced by the actions one takes.  Taking my own process, I believe that I have reduced my risk as I do pay attention and because I do.  I do not drip the dividends I receive but selectively reinvest them into a researched stock positions currently owned or a new position That should if research is proven out will enhance my overall return.  Like many processes the returns are not always 100% guaranteed but if one does pay attention (and I do) any mistakes that can happen are taken care by researching the cause and resolving the issue, which can also mean selling at a loss, although in my case I very seldom end up in the loss column. Unlike the many who wait and see what the so-called experts have to say or do nothing because they have not paid attention or are afraid to sell generating a loss with a wait and see attitude hoping for a better price only to lose more.  Does my process work?  Well for me I would believe that it does as my own history would indicate. Being one with no background in investing or having a career in that field I have done quite well. I do not use any analyst for investment help and all decisions are mine.  I do not make recommendations nor tell others how to invest their money (other than immediate family members to make suggestions if asked) but will discuss with others on what I do, even to the point of discussing some failures I have made. Overall, I am up +36.20%on growth with SO, + dividends as of this very moment (just looked) I am quite satisfied with the return.",2024-09-30
"@Curonian Research The main point of my post was to reiterate the scale of the increasing demand for electricity and the SO's favorable position in dealing with this demand. The growing demand will drive the long-term SO's profits and ultimately impact PSC to more favorable policies. Most electric utility investors, in general, and SO, in particular, are long-term investors holding this stock for a long time, often for decades. They are not traders seeking to make a quick buck. Yes, there is always risk associated with investing in individual stocks. However, as you pointed out, SO proved to be one of the most stable and predictable electric utility companies. Any short-term retreat of SO stock should be viewed as a buying opportunity and nothing else.I appreciate your overall balanced article, but I can not accept your conclusion. It is not time to lock in some of ""the capital gains of this year."" What we are witnessing now is just the beginning of a supercycle where electric utility companies, including SO, will be the major beneficiaries of the AI boom.",2024-09-30
"@jonesdl261 these are valid points, capital recycling can enhance returns but it adds to risks considerably, most retail investors probably should not bother with it.",2024-09-30
"@daskapital1000 thank you for the detail, appreciate the information. Do you know if these new projects mentioned are already included in the $48 billion 5-year capex plan?",2024-09-30
@FirstToThird then why not sell 30% of the appreciated position to wait for the div yield to recover or seek another alternative with the proceeds? This is a more complex approach but makes sure portfolio momentum is optimised,2024-09-30
"@Oil Can agreed!  In at $72 during May 2024.  ( going to be in for verrry long) Don't care about share price going up and harvesting gains, it's the Div that matters to folks like us income seekers/ investors as opposed to traders looking for a quick buck.   3 cheers for the Long Crowd!",2024-09-28
Dividends are locked in at the buy point (assuming no cuts).  Long and holding utilities whose divvy rate increases only are larger  from a lower cost basis…The only time I sell a divvy stocks is if it’s in danger - whether macro or competition - or if it exploded multiples higher in price (Broadcom/AI hype I let go this year b4 the AI bubble pops),2024-09-28
What is meant by merchant power PROJECT? Why can’t electricity be sold to any merchant that wants to buy it? Excess power from the nuclear reactor should provide additional income I would think.,2024-09-28
"Southern is well-positioned to take advantage of the rapidly growing demand for electricity in Georgia and the South of the US. The demand is driven by several factors, including, first of all, data centers and new businesses. Georgia Power estimates that 80% of the new load on its system is due to data centers. The demand for electricity in Georgia is so high that Georgia Power has updated its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) two years ahead of schedule. Demand could increase by 6,600 megawatts (MW) by 2031, which is a 17-fold increase from previous projections (winter), and by 7,100 MW by 2031, which is a 28-fold increase (summer). This spring Southern Co. secured a settlement plan with Georgia regulators that would allow the utility to fast-track 1,400 megawatts of new gas-fired power plants in the next three years. Georgia Power sought permission last year to rush the plan through regulatory approval to meet what it now forecasts will be 17 times more power demand growth than it had predicted it would need just 18 months earlier due to new data centers and factories being planned in the state. The plan was APPROVED by the Georgia Public Service Commission. The PSC approves a Georgia Power plan to increase generating capacity by contracting with a natural gas plant in Pace, Florida, and Mississippi Power Co., a Southern Company corporate sibling. The PSC also will allow Georgia Power to build three new combustion turbines at Plant Yates near Newnan that could burn natural gas or oil.thecurrentga.org/...And finally, forget the 4.1% dividend. I'm convinced that in a few short years, the current 3.1% dividend yield will be significantly reduced because the stock will go higher, much higher.I'm long $SO since 2013",2024-09-28
"I have owned $SO since 2019 and have periodically added to it and I am satisfied with the overall return.  Yes, like many I like to see dividend increases as I invest for the dividend and now the suggestion is to sell as the yearly yield does not meet a standard that may not be the standard of the author who now feels that I should lock in the profits and preserve the dividends received.  I understand that the utilities are regulated, but I also understand why for some investors or so-called analysts may believe that they know better.  Well, maybe they do, but I am one who pays attention to what my investments provide and currently $SO provides a part of my total investment strategy and while it may differ from the author's viewpoint, I have 920 shares and have no plans to sell.",2024-09-28
Anyone who says 'it's time to lock in gains' on a utility stock doesn't understand why investors buy utility stocks to begin with....Long $SO for so long I can't remember when I bought it.,2024-09-28
"I've owned SO for over 15 years and see no reason to sell, My basis is $30.53, dividend yield on cost is 9.13%, and I have a capital gain of 195.46%. I see no reason to sell and give the government money with capital gains tax. Also with AI the need for electric power is going to grow.",2024-09-28
"@Jamjack - lol, I never said otherwise. What a sophomoric response ... it's right up there with ""we need CO2 to live"" or ""climate is cyclical"". No one (certainly not me...) ever said otherwise.Meantime, the reality is that Florida homeowners can't afford home insurance (even if they are lucky enough to find it ..) and beach-houses in North Carolina continue to fall into the ocean:www.youtube.com/...So, you may agree with trump and his non-science backed assertion that global warming is a ""hoax"", but you are paying for it anyway - with your car and home insurance, and indirectly with Federal debt due to massive (off-budget ...) increases in natural disaster ""recovery"" fund:www.cbo.gov/...So you can look in the review mirror at Spanish treasury ships (seriously? lol), but I'm an engineer that prefers to look at modern day science, facts, and statistics.
