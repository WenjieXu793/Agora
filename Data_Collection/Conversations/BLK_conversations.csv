@Bill the Bag Man agree.  At a macro level the weekly summary that would be somewhat useful would be the number of companies that reported positive earnings growth or revenue growth net inflation.  Of which I think only CCL did.  Would need to check.  But otherwise not a very helpful metric.,2024-10-05
Do companies ever really guide earnings very high? No. They guide on the conservative cautious side. Usually that is why an equity tanks if they miss or guide lower. Nothing earth shattering and it is not saying much about the macro economic picture.,2024-10-05
"@kalu0003 thanks for asking. I think you follow SIP on SA, but if not, please do.As for that choice, speaking only for myself (and since I'm a long-term investor who is willing to adjust my portfolio at any moment, rather than buy and hold as a rule), I prefer BRKB. That assumes I have to buy and not be able to sell. Simple reason is, as I just wrote in my article out today on BRKB, it is a diversified basket, essentially a fund run by some epically talented people. BLK is like most other stocks to me: rentals until the whole market gets ""flushed out."" But until that happens (could be next week or years from now), I'm happy to try to approach it as I do any stock with a decent dividend: quarter-by-quarter and long-term, I want to get more dividend and more total return in dollars than a buy and hold investor would get. For instance, if I bought and held my 40 stock portfolio, I could own 2.5% in each stock. So I'd get dividends on 2.5% of my portfolio from each stock, each quarter. But my rotation approach often allows me to get dividends on 3%-5% of my portfolio on those same stocks, and sidestep those inevitable 20%-50% single stock dives along the way. I hope that helps!",2024-09-30
@No Guilt for a long term oriented investor - what is your take regarding BLK vs BRK.B? Which one do you personally like better as a long term investment? Thanks for your views in advance.,2024-09-29
"@Sungarden Investment Publishing You obviously have a very strong background for putting this analysis of BLK together, so thanks for writing it. I have held BLK for approx 2.3 years and I have an unrealized gain of 38% on it so far.It looks slightly overvalued on FastGraphs at this point in time, but its EPS growth projection looks great and I am happy to continue holding it in my portfolio.",2024-09-29
"@No Guilt thanks, awesome, talk to you soon. If there are any names you are interested in, lmk and if they're on my 75-stock watchlist, I'll move them up the priority list to write on.",2024-09-29
"Helpful discussion.The stock has risen lately but still roughly where it was toward the end of 2021. Good stocks too can get stuck in a rut for significant stretches of time. BLK is a super heavyweight financial company with a relatively light balance sheet. Its b/sheet size is $125B. The super h/weight banking companies of similar scale have balance sheet size running into $trillions (JPM, GS, HSBC etc). Relative to the b/sheet size its capitalization is huge - about 40B. Banking structures cannot have that kind of capital.And then there is BLK's power and heft at play in corporate boardrooms and their politics. Is there anything on the horizon that could derail the passive investing / ETF culture ?",2024-09-29
"@Sungarden Investment Publishing Yeah man.Lots of these cookie cutter articles - Coca-Cola is a soft drink company that sells soda, water juice, coffee blah blah blah.  No joke, we all know who they are.  In their most recent Q they grew 2% meeting analyst expectations.  They’ve paid a dividend forever.  Now to valuation, I like the company long term but it’s a pass for me as I’d like to buy $20 cheaper.  Over and over and over again.  It’s just a tease with no substance.I like your background, being in the industry and changing your mind on the stock.  I like that you put your money where your mouth is and the personal touch.",2024-09-29

"@bbeltkyle89 futures are contracts that are listed in an exchange like S&P 500 futures.   However, banks can make forward contracts on individual stocks and ETF’s with ease, which allows those with access to these forwards to obtain forward hedges and open positions on IBIT.",2024-09-23
"@HamishMacEwan Futures are to 'commodities' as Options are to securities. I do not think there are Futures contracts on IBIT, as its an etf. in your quote, i suspect ""investors"" is refering specifically to those investing in IBIT.",2024-09-22
