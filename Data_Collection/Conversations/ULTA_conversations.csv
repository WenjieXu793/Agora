"@Graham Stevens Totally! I’ve witnessed some really wild crashes in retail. I’m way too risk-averse to gamble on those stocks, but if I had to pick one, I’d probably go with ULTA",2024-10-04
"@Ahoy Alpha quite right, so to assume Sephora has the same margins as the whole selective retailing is just guessing. I am not sure what the margins of the other parts of selective retailing are but if they are less than 9% then obviously Sephora would have higher than 9% operating margin.Also 24S started in 2017 so for all we know some of the growth in selective retailing is this not Sephora.",2024-10-01
"I’m staying long. TD Cowen Downgrades $ULTA Beauty to Hold from Buy with a PT of $395 Analyst comments ""The Cost to Compete Going Higher. Promo intensity, increased distribution points at Sephora & AMZN, and category normalization are likely to persist for the next year. Stock has reached our PT, and we see a lack of catalysts & upside to ests. heading into the Oct. Investor Day. Valuation appears full after 4x of multiple expansion to 16x P/E since early Aug. on +15% stock run and (11%) est. cuts."" Analyst Oliver Chen",2024-09-23
I was bottom fishing ULTA before Berkshire.  Congratulations to them for joining the party. Hopefully they will add more to it. It would be sad if we find out next quarter they sold out. Long from $368,2024-09-19
"I bought calls a few weeks ago when it was roughly $375 ish, and Buffett had purchased the shares. The stock must meet Uncle Warren's famous criteria in the long term. It does look like it has sustainable competitive advantages.",2024-09-18
@Krypto can’t agree more.  I was gifted smoked salmon sold through an amazon seller that took a week to arrive using a lunchbox size ice pack inside insulation.  It was not fit for human consumption.  Amazon has no quality control over products sold or packaging and shipping.,2024-09-17
Ulta needs to start prosecuting shoplifters.  Estée Lauder needs to appeal to younger women and elf is the best dupe makeup around.  The quality is really good and you can’t beat the price.   It has a good reputation too so I can see why other brands are worried.  It definitely makes you second-guess spending $22 on a lip liner when you can get one for three dollars and they look exactly the same and work exactly the same.,2024-09-12
"@investor’s compass thank you for your well written and timely analysis. I am a long time ULTA stockholder. My preferred holding period is forever. I have been dismayed at ULTA’s growth evaporating with same stores sales stagnating, causing the current massive pull back in its stock price. Unmentioned as a temporary (hopefully) cause for ULTA’s lack of growth and inventory increase, is its recent ERP software implantation that I understand is nearing completion. I suspect they implemented a new version of SAP. In my experience a new SAP implementation is debilitating to the best organizations. The short term impact of the disruptions caused to operations are typically underplayed by managers to avoid looking incompetent or for their investment to look like it was a poor decision. I am hoping this will in hindsight also prove to have been the case with ULTA.I don’t understand how Sephora, from its Kohls based premises, can cause this much damage. Who wants to go to Kohls?Thank you again. Your article is bolstering my resolve to hold out for better days.",2024-09-10
I'd be interested in $ELF in the $95-100 range. The stock was bottoming near that range after a correction in late 2023. Imo that would be a reasonable price considering the growth opportunities as well,2024-09-10
"$367 was the price of Este Lauder less than three years ago. The author of this article thinks it's worth $95. It is currently selling for $84. EL is one more example of a company putting way too much money investing in China. Always sounds good. Seldom works out. That said, EL is, if going out in time a couple of years, worth more than $84 or $95. They will overcome their current problems. They may not be worth $367, but they'll easily surpass $84 or $95.",2024-09-10
It should be illegal to initiate coverage or “change” price targets 3 days or more after earnings. I constantly see these analysts pile onto negative or positive momentum.,2024-09-10
"B.Riley? Not bankrupt yet? Anyway ELF is still absurdly priced, while EL needs a turnaround. ULTA at least is very cheap, with a catalyst it can start to perform again. No hurry but it's a buy.",2024-09-10
