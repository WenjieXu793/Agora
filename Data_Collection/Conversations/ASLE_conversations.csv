"@Joshua Heller Think againOver the longer-term, we believe that ASLE shares have a good chance of reaching and perhaps even exceeding $100 within the next two to three years. Given the massive addressable market and limited competition for AerAware for the foreseeable future, the Company is likely to receive large orders from several airlines for this product beyond its initial launch customer. During a conversation earlier this year, CEO Nicolas Finazzo expressed confidence to us that the Company's annual sales of AerAware could eventually amount to around 1,000 units. In addition to the bullish long-term outlook for AerAware, the Company's core asset management business should greatly benefit from what is expected to be the greatest re-equipment ""super-cycle"" in the airline industry's history as a record number aircraft are projected to be retired over the coming 18-24 months.",2024-10-02

"@Dhierin Bechai cool, if that's the case, I guess you will make even more when you learn to admit you're holding a bag. And even more, if you learn how not to let that happen. My advice is to sell tomorrow if you're managing anyone's money or at least set a stop loss at 4.7 USD. Then apologize to all the people who lost money because of you.",2024-09-30
"@schweis35 Here's my back of the envelope math based on just their inventory/cash numbers from the current 10-Q.(all in $Millions)Current Assets:Cash and Cash Equivalents - $4,285 Inventory:Aircraft, airframes, engines, and parts, net - $221,371+Fixed Assets:Aircraft and Engines held for lease, net - $31,491+Property and equipment, net - $32,683+ Inventory:Aircraft, airframes, engines, and parts, net - 157,442= $447,272Subtract Total Liabilities - $148,895= $298,377Current Market Cap is $283,060Management seems to be extremely confident their inventory is worth way more than the amount they paid to acquire it. If that's the case, how is this not a steal at this share price? And if it goes lower, your margin of safety continues to go up.",2024-09-23
"Dhierin, are you able to value the feedstock and assets on the balance sheet using their 25% IRR? If so, you might have a net-net opportunity here.",2024-09-18
