"If anything, the political risk is making this stock undervalued. Look at how much it dipped every time Trump or Harris said something about blocking the Nippon deal. If they were in favor, this would be above $45 already.",2024-10-06
"@PEAK AUTOS I would bet that Chinese cars made from Chinese steel either weight more or are less strong that their counterparts made in the USA using CLF's automotive steel - it's a special high strength lightweight steel and not cheap compared to regular sheet metal. ArcelorMittal patented at least one special type of automotive steel and licensed it to AKS, which CLFs bought - so if China is using that type of steel they're stealing AM's IP.",2024-09-30

"@Tradestranger I can't decipher that, but I'm pretty sure there's a 25% tariff on steel from China, so it's not coming in at a discount unless in spite of the tariff it's still cheaper. Which it might well be...",2024-09-26

Steel will be made in AmericaBy American workersLowest of the LowPolitical Hack,2024-09-26
"If Nippon acquires US Steel, steel will continue to be manufactured in America by American workers.  Did she just change the standard and move the goal posts?  In the past they have spoken of American OWNERSHIP of US Steel, which is silly since it is currently a publicly traded company owned by investors all over the world and does not have ""American Ownership"" now.",2024-09-26
If the deal is blocked couldn’t US steel simply go back to the position it was in before the initial takeover bid?,2024-09-25
"The situation involving U.S. Steel and the United Steelworkers (USW) union is complex, with significant tension around the proposed acquisition by Nippon Steel. U.S. Steel has warned that failure to proceed with the merger could lead to job losses and plant closures, particularly affecting union jobs in regions like the Mon Valley and Gary, Indiana. The USW has expressed skepticism about the deal, citing concerns over job security and the reliability of Nippon's commitments. Political figures, including President Biden, have shown opposition to the acquisition, highlighting its potential impact on American manufacturing and local economies.",2024-09-25
"When you started with, “U.S. Steel . . . is one of the world’s largest steelmakers” you lost me. It’s not. I don’t even think it is in the top 25 worldwide.",2024-09-25
The CAPEX is for Big River 2 which is coming online in Q4. The facility alone is probably worth $42 a share. This article could have been written about literally any manufacturing company. You are out of your depth here.,2024-09-25
@The At Ease Investor “US Steel falls as Trump reiterates that he will block sale to Nippon Steel”seekingalpha.com/...“The difference is that Trump will honor his word.”Bet you’re sorry you said that.But maybe not. You probably enjoy the taste of Kool-Aid.,2024-09-24
@qwerty11 I'll happily accept Mr.Trump's buyout offer assuming it's the same as Nippon & let's not pretend that any S&P 500 company is 'American owned' it's American controlled possibly but there are plenty of foreign shareholders. If we can own 0.01% we can own 100%.,2024-09-24
This is making me bullish because I think it will encourage Nippon to proactive JV 51% out to CLF in a sweetheart deal and get this thing done.,2024-09-24
Sorry guys.  Both candidates are going to shut down this sale...,2024-09-24
The union is shooting itself in the foot in opposing this deal. The company would be stronger with Japanese management and union jobs more secure.,2024-09-22
"@bessaff I do not consider myself a trader as I hold positions for long periods.  HOWEVER ... if I see an opportunity with a risk-reward situation way out-of-balance due to some circumstance, I'll take advantage ... why not make a short-term profit or take a shot?  I don't think Nippon will prevail, but politics is in play here along with the puppeteers we do not see.",2024-09-19
"@Balaland I don't believe US Steel has made rail steel products for the railroads for a long time now.  Just go through the Annual Report and the only mention of anything related to rails is either in the risk statement pertaining to potential business disruptions as they rely on rail services OR the disposition of their previous positions in Transtar, a rail operations business they sold to Fortress.  The concern you raised either doesn't exist or resides with other domestic steel companies like $CLF and $STLD and a list of others you can find via a simple search. Note that NIPPON does presently produce rail steel and any that is not produced domestically is subject to trade controls and tariffs.  Their advance rail product is called HE Rail.
