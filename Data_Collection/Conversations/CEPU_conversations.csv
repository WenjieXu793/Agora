@stephen15235 that is just the type of question AI should be useful for...ask Gemini.  My larger positions are YPF and VIST and TGS and there are others... but I am no expert so you might also look at the top holdings of the Argentina ETFs.,2024-09-13
"@tincupinhand curious your focus on ""Vaca Muerta"", what are the specific ADRs available in the US related to that?  Have run a stock screen on my Fidelity and find only 15 Argentinian ADRs...maybe that's only what Fidelity makes visible to me for some reason...",2024-09-12
