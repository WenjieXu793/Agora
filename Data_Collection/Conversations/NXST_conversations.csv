"@Stefan Lingmerth Thanks for the comment.They have some amortizing loans, i.e. where they regularly have to repay some principal. This amounts to roughly $125m per year at the current run rate.Their dividends take up another $220m+.Which leaves the rest to be used for debt reduction, buybacks or acquisitions. They stated at the beginning of the year that they want to repay some debt this year as they see a lot of cash coming in this year due to political advertising. That said, I do believe this to be the minority of FCF and the vast majority be used for buybacks as long as the share price stays depressed. They made it very clear that they regard the current level of the share price as way too low and just had another $1.5bn bubyack authorization approved this summer on top of the roughly $0.5bn they still had outstanding. And unlike other companies they actually use those authorizations.But if there is a sensible acquisition opportunity I would expect that to take priority over all the other options and might even lead to some capital raising.I hope that helps.",2024-09-30
Great write up - thanks man - what have they said regarding debt repayments and share buybacks. Whatâ€™s the focus right now? Seems like share count has been aggressively reduced from 2019 to now,2024-09-29
