Replace some 8.125% debt with 6.0% debt and buy back over 5% of your current market cap?  Sounds good to me as a shareholder!,2024-10-02

"I want to say LVS and Wynn are both plays on Macau but not an expert. China has apparently gone back to buying Boeing Aircraft is the rumor which of course can't happen because of the strike going on there which no one talks about. Long $f Ford Motor Company strong buy as isn't the labor issue now correctly resolved Morgan Stanley? Be nice to see both Ford and Stellantis join with GM in their rollout of charging infrastructure as Tesla starts pulling back from....does Tesla even have sales in North America currently? They don't act like they do anymore. Might have a free battery electric vehicle facility in North Carolina soon as well which if true sounds bullish for *SOMEBODY* in the automotive sector. HondaJet doing great in North Carolina as well is the rumor anyways. Not sure what Gulfstream is up to these days in response to that. Cirrus, Eclipse, IconA5 know what those are up to though as they with HondaJet all represent the future of flight for the USA certainly. Is the FAA going to attack all of these businesses too? What is the FAA *""AI""* plan anyways? Have they put out a bid for having a commercial aircraft voice assistant that they can interface with? Amazon and Apple I'm sure would love to help with that, right?",2024-09-26
I hope this pop reverses.  It was getting so close to buying territory for me.,2024-09-26
"@Howard Jay Klein Three years seems to be a long time for the debt reduction to ""begin to get noticed."" I'm in the same play in both TEVA and VTRS where the debt reduction is in its latter stages and core businesses remaining highly cash generative.Less further along are my positions in WBD and PARA where longer-term, accumulation at near current levels will be rewarded. The debt reduction play on CZR seems early based on performance the past few years. Still, its a great name to sell puts on when the stock downdrafts, and I think I will start accumulating a position. I've already taken some nice cash out of CZR via sales of puts mostly with $32/$33 strikes yielding more than 20% on the strike price on an annualized basis.",2024-09-14
$35 Billion in legal bets and estimated illegal bets of around $500 Billion. Legal betting is slowly catching up. :-),2024-09-14
"thanks for the comments all. The thesis is simple for both: Prime culprit in bearish sentiment ongoing is debt hangover from bad deals that created the cos. But persistent pay downs will bring debt load to a level that believe me, Mr. Market wiill suddenly discover loads the cos with cash and begin to finance bigger ambitions.",2024-09-12
"CZR has been dead money for over a year, missing out on a nice stock market move. Reeg talks a good game, and many analysts see hope for the stock, but until there is a catalyst, such as an asset sale, do not see this going anywhere fast. I think VICI passing on their call option to buy Centaur has left CZR looking for another deal, and probably the high interest rates are hurting that effort. That deal for Centaur would have freed 2B that could have been applied to debt.As for digital, wish they would sell it to DKNG or another competitor.",2024-09-12
"The connection to Disney is that Disney also puts out fairy tales. CZR doubling its digital market share is a fairy tale. CZR is an also ran in online gaming and sports betting. I see no change in their failed strategy, so how do they magically improve their market share? Reeg is destroying the B&M experience for me. I have plenty of offers to get comped at Caesars Palace. I choose to go elsewhere when I go to Vegas. The casino layout us is a mess and the high limit area is a joke.",2024-09-11
