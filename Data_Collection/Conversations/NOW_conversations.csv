"So smart to buy Nvda now at only $3T. What can go wrong at this time, even more competition than they're already facing today?",2024-10-05
@combatcorpsmanVN they need to retain mind share with garbage competition like Temu attempting to outspend them advertising to people looking for the lowest prices on the worst quality products. AWS is doing fine though MS has really gotten it together with Azure while Google cloud has their thumbs up their collective exits.,2024-10-04
"As an Amazon shareholder, I want to let the company know that I absolutely love paying for commercials during Thursday night football. Apparently Amazon isn’t doing as well as they claim to be when they have to screw people paying for cable forcing him to watch commercials because Bezos and his replacement aren’t making enough money. It’s really be. S.!",2024-10-04
"NVDA will continue plodding along, & then one morning it will suddenly surge to over 20% while the bears will be in denial & make up more excuses as to why they were wrong about their dismal predictions.",2024-10-04

@Julian Lin Do you have any recommendations for software firm in bargain?,2024-09-29
"@Julian Lin. The argument is valid.  How do you get the conclusion """"The stock is priced for around 11% annual returns over the next 5.5 Years""?",2024-09-29
"I agree with your valuation methodology but IMO you miss an important point.  Let's say you're an institution with large sums to invest.  You want steady 20% or so growth with few, if any, estimate misses.  There aren't too many stocks with sufficient liquidity for institutions growing as fast as NOW in such a steady fashion.  The steady growth and liquidity of NOW is both have value I believe.  Personally, if I didn't have a position I'd wait for a pullback but given it's steady growth, dollar cost averaging seems appropriate as well.",2024-09-27
"I bought the dip in May/June when this hit $650s, thought I would get more bites.   But hoping it revisits these levels.  As a long-term buy, it’s a solid investment.",2024-09-26
It's refreshing to see an unabridged Sell rating.I already sold!,2024-09-26
Is interesting that the new FBI HQ is in Maryland actually so this should come as a surprise to no one now. Not really sure how Virginia is right proper handling of Spaceport Virginia other than to say New York State doesn't have one of those either just a Mayor now about to spend the rest of his life in Prison. Long US Treasuries strong buy. Short gold strong sell. Does New York State even have an energy plan?,2024-09-26

"Okta is already beaten down, but NOW is trading high at 200x GAAP earnings, and the stock could very well halve and still be expensive.",2024-09-25
"I don't see how such a highly speculative news with an evidently limited effect on one of the most diversified by revenue company could justify the fall by 4% premarket... If it goes even lower, there will be an excellent buying opportunity of a very qualitative stock.",2024-09-25
I've never quite understood what makes this product so sticky as software to create workflows isn't exactly revolutionary.,2024-09-23
