"@Nicholas Marshi Thanks Nick! SA strikes again, reporting the ANNUAL NIIPS as if it was the quarterly (or at least not making clear the diff!) This is why we think it is ALWAYS critical to read the BDC's official docs, PR, Presentation & 10-Q/K.Bart",2024-09-26
"@BartAtTheRanch No Special. Net Investment Income Per Share not even covering the regular dividend and portfolio yield likely to drop from spread compression and lower interest rates. $0.12 a quarter may prove to be ""peak [regular] distribution"" for ICMB. Investcorp might need to make contingency plans because net book value continues to fall, as do earnings, the payout and even their own compensation - now under $4mn a year with no Incentive Fee. Is it worth it ?",2024-09-26
"NAVPS down 3,3% QoQ. Note that the summary implies NIIPS is quarterly, but in fact is annual (see PR). The quarterly number, $.09, doesn't even cover the dividend per share. And with that NAVPS drop how long can ICMB continue?Bart",2024-09-26
