"@GreedySOB Yeah today looks like the ""rest of us"" are not as smart as you. How much have you made on CTAS? Is the price expensive? yes. Good stocks cost more than bad ones.",2024-09-26
@GDPPP A 5 year expected peg ratio below 2.50 means start nibbling.Below 2.00 means buy more.,2024-09-26
"@Mikr using this logic then as long as a company is growing and margins are expanding the stock is a buy and price does not matterGood luck with that, but the rest of us want to understand why the price that we're paying is good for the underlying business",2024-09-26
"@GreedySOB Alright all numbers guy tell us the price CTAS is a buy in your book? what price last year did you think it a buy? How long should readers forego stock price performance to buy it at a price you think is fair?CTAS's numbers are a reflection of their proven ability to expand margin, manage growth, add new sales to existing customers and manage acquisitions. No rating less than a ""buy"" is appropriate unless the analyst can point to things that would cause those proven company advantages to diminish.  The fact the stock has performed well for a long period really has nothing to do with how an investor should look at it today. They compounded earnings and have the tools to continue to compound earnings. There is no ""thesis"" to be tested.22% is real money---it is not a thesis or an opinion.",2024-09-26
"@Buyandhold 2012 I couldn't be happier as a quality value investor.Cintas has achieved exceptional operational performance due to its consistent revenue growth, reaching an all-time high of $2.51 billion in Q1 2025, a 6.8% increase from the previous year.The company has maintained strong organic growth rates across its segments, with notable increases in First Aid and Safety Services (14%) and Fire Protection Services (13.8%).Cintas has also achieved record gross margins of 50.1% and operating income margins of 22.4%.Additionally, the company has demonstrated robust free cash flow growth, increasing by 62.4% in Q1 2025, allowing for significant reinvestment in the business and shareholder returns.This leads to the following outstanding shareholder rewards.Cintas' Cash Return On Invested Capital (CROIC) of 24.7% ranks in the 93.1% percentile for the sector.Absolutely world class!The stock is unfortunately extremely poorly valued on its 3y P/FCF/GY ratio of 6.25.In other words, we are surfing on an extremely high wave of euphoria that is only partially fundamentally justified.Long $CTAS...but even if you would throw yourself on the floor right now and beg heart-rendingly.I WILL NOT SELL YOU MY BELOVED CINTAS SHARES!UNDERSTAND?NEVER! ",2024-09-26
@Buyandhold 2012 But would you buy it at today's price though or at what price you think you would be owning shares of this quality compounder? I would likely be a buyer in the $175-180 range (post split),2024-09-26
"@Mikr rational decision making = understanding the fundamentals then putting a price on those fundamentals (which is what you do not seem to care about). Would you buy the stock at any price? that's not rational decision making..... and the stock being up 22% since the article neither proves nor disproves the thesis, endless examples of stocks fluctuating with sentiment",2024-09-25
$CTAS is my type of stock.It keeps going up over the long term.It's in the cleaning business.Its motto should be:  Cleanliness is next to Godliness.,2024-09-25
@GreedySOB Rational decision making involves understanding the fundamentals of the company behind the numbers. What are their strategic advantages? what pricing power do they have? One can pick apart the financials on any given day but fail to understand that it is the fundamental strengths of the company's business that yield the financials.It may not hold but the stock is up 22% since this analyst elected to call it a hold and claimed it was somewhat overvalued.,2024-09-25
Seems more a no playâ€¦thus a hold vrs a sell. Top performer w a pseudo monopoly and fantastic management but rich valuation.,2024-09-24
"I think this is one of the greatest ""sleeper"" stocks around. I bought some close to 5 years ago as a core non tech holding. I just love the long term chart, and their margins and return on capital are incredible. Companies making these kinds of returns are rarely cheap. I agree with the title of the article. BUY IT. HOLD IT.",2024-09-19
"A dominant player in a boring niche business is exactly the kind of business I love to own. Fortunately, I was able to load up shares in March, 2020. However, the valuation is a concern going forward. Recently trimmed 10% to lock in some gains.",2024-09-18
I have been very well satisfied with my Cintas investment for over 5 years!,2024-09-17
