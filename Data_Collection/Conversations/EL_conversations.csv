"@Rleaton Ferrari was must-own where sales do not depend on Chinese rich spending less. I rated the stock a buy for 112% return.seekingalpha.com/...btw @Jjww9293 I will probably take ELF, which sells cheap products, off my list once I complete my stock picks in the luxury market.",2024-09-27
"@Chris Lau high end luxury is a great investment but I’d aim for the tippy top. Hermes, Louis, and Ferrari",2024-09-26
@Jjww9293 ELF has no connection to China. It's on my list because another reader recommended it. ULTA too.I also have all the luxury vehicle makers on my list (Mercedes and BMW took a huge revenue hit because of China).,2024-09-26
@Chris Lau why elf? I get that el is betting on chinese consumer but no one in china uses elf products.,2024-09-26
"@pat45 luxury stocks all underwent a significant correction, some more than others. you arent buying on the high",2024-09-26
"Luxury brands and China's continued contagion are tied. My picks are LVMH, ELF, and EL.We will find out soon if this is a head fake.",2024-09-26
It will take a while for any stimulus to help and I hate wall street screaming buy on these highs.   China is still problem with US sanctions,2024-09-26
I miss on Hermes yet again. I don’t see this stimulus helping them all that much. It prolly helps Louis Vuitton a bunch tho,2024-09-26
"Great timing on your $EL call, Ian!China stimulus was much needed and very helpful for this name.",2024-09-26
EL suffers from weak 2nd generation family management.The current CEO should have been replaced years ago.EL can not be bought before the new CEO has been namedand that person has had time to show improved managementof the company.When you buy equity IMO what you are really buying is the current top management performance.  EL continues as a sell.,2024-09-24
I like Tom Ford. So I’m taking a chance on this stock.,2024-09-24
"@Ian Bezek growth had to slow from the crazy pace it was at, but the business still has momentum",2024-09-21
@sitecast You asked why it traditionally has had a high valuation -- because it traditionally had exceptional growth. That's the answer. Whether it is predictive of future returns remains to be seen.,2024-09-21
"@Ian Bezek I mean, that's great and all...but I'm not in the camp that thinks what happened 30, 20, 10, or even 5 years ago, has much of a bearing on today's valuation. I can show you lots of companies that did that, but very few that have done what EL has done int he last 5 years, which carry the type of valuation premium EL has carried in recent years, while treading water or backsliding.",2024-09-21
"@Alex Pitti @Ian Bezek Would you say $EL and $ELF target customers are similar? I don’t think so. Sure there’s overlap but ELF are super cheap, drugstore priced cosmetics. L’Oreal also sells cheap drugstore cosmetics. I would say ELF is more of a threat to them versus EL. Then again, this whole category is something I’m ignorant about.",2024-09-21
"@Alex Pitti L'Oreal/Shiseido/Estee Lauder have about $36 billion in combined annual revenues. ELF is projected to do $1.3 billion for FY '25, so a small piece of the overall pie. If ELF can keep growing at a 20%+ revenue rate long-term, it will start to eat into the overall share for the big guys. Or (as the stock market is suggesting now) perhaps ELF's growth will slow down dramatically.",2024-09-21
@Alex Pitti What do you mean by crushed? Stock price or fundamentals?,2024-09-21
Elf has really crushed estee lauder. but maybe el will finally turnaround,2024-09-21
Thanks for the article. I’m thinking it’s close to a buy.,2024-09-20
"@sitecast Revenues grew more than 500% and earnings per share more than 5,000% since 1995.Question is whether the past few years have fundamentally changed the biz/industry for the worst, or if it is specific short-term issues related to pandemic and China that can and will be solved.",2024-09-20
