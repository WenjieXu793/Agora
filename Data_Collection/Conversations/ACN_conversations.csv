"Yes. This is why when ACN was breaking down below $317 I was buying even though I got comments not agreeing with my point of view- ok no problem. When I saw Jensen on CNBC talking about enterprise AI partnerships with Accenture I knew it was on like Donkey Kong (Do the young kids still say this?). Folks, you have to learn to go with where the puck is going and get in early, ignore the noise before the market catches up. $387 will be a point of resistance.",2024-10-06
"So smart to buy Nvda now at only $3T. What can go wrong at this time, even more competition than they're already facing today?",2024-10-05
@combatcorpsmanVN they need to retain mind share with garbage competition like Temu attempting to outspend them advertising to people looking for the lowest prices on the worst quality products. AWS is doing fine though MS has really gotten it together with Azure while Google cloud has their thumbs up their collective exits.,2024-10-04
"As an Amazon shareholder, I want to let the company know that I absolutely love paying for commercials during Thursday night football. Apparently Amazon isn’t doing as well as they claim to be when they have to screw people paying for cable forcing him to watch commercials because Bezos and his replacement aren’t making enough money. It’s really be. S.!",2024-10-04

10/2I hope everyone was able to see ACN on (CNBC) with Jenson Huang today talking about their new AI business group. Nice aftermarket price action on the news.  finance.yahoo.com/...,2024-10-02

"These types of partnerships are part of Nvidia value chain.  Will see multiple such partnerships.  Nvidia is a Gorilla like Microsoft and Intel in its heyday.  Nvidia has a proprietary that allows other companies to develop hi adware and software applications. It has a value chain like Dell, SMCI, Accenture, etc that add value and market.  Look at the PC market in 1980. Hi switching cost for any company trying to seek alternatives or develop the whole hardware and software stack in house.  Huge delays.

"TD Cowen Upgrades $ACN to Buy from Hold, Raises PT to $400 from $321 Analyst Comments: ""A cleaner setup and catalyst path ahead is forming. ACN enters FY25 with a strong foundation from recent bookings outperformance, fading market headwinds, Gen AI traction, and potential demand tailwinds connected to Fed rate cuts that should be supportive of CY25 IT budgets & tech multiples.""  ""At a higher level, our upgrade is a call on a directional improvement in the Services sector — with ACN serving as a vehicle for many investors to gain sector exposure — and progress across multiple areas of ACN's business, including dissipating pain points as it exits FY24. These factors support a healthy near-term setup based on how ACN positioned its 1Q & FY25 growth outlook, which limits downside risk.""  ""In our view, a cushion is in place and the bear case from here requires either CY25 budget pressure — which would suggest a worsening macro situation — or too rich a valuation which we think most investors will see through given the building proof points of an accelerating organic growth trajectory through FY26 and our expectation of broader Services investment positioning ahead of an anticipated 2025 demand recovery.""

@justaguy11 I agree that is a problem with models as it’s very hard to account for this.The upside I see from using a model is that when I have an investable universe of 50 stocks my model can alert me when any of the stocks trend down to an attractive entry point.The valuation ratings aren’t intended as an end all but rather a starting point for further research.I appreciate your thoughts on this.,2024-09-30
"@Dividend Yield Theorist The problem with models is that LRCX, KLAC etc al tend to vastly overshoot eps estimates during upcycles.",2024-09-30
@justaguy11 my valuation model is pretty conservative hence the early rating downgrade.If LRCX can grow at a pace above its historical growth rates it may still offer an attractive return from its current price.I personally have a long position in LRCX that is fully built out so I likely won’t be buying more right now.,2024-09-30
@Dividend Yield Theorist Perhaps overvalued on July 10th but almost certainly undervalued now.  LRCX lowered their shares outstanding over the past 7 years from 170m to 129m.  They are likely to hit $50 to $60 in EPS in the next upcycle with more beyond that.  A 28 multiple applied to $55 in EPS is almost DOUBLE the price today.,2024-09-30
@coastalcruiser you could tell what the valuation would be from the title.,2024-09-30
"@justaguy11 the downgrade for LRCX comes after the 15% rally the stock has seen since its latest low on September 10th.My custom valuation tool is fully automated and runs on its own therefore it will make silly predictions from time to time. In this case I believe it worked out exactly as intended.As the share price of LRCX fell between mid-August and early September the valuation rating flipped from a Hold to a Buy. Since the 10th, the share price has moved higher and closed the “buying” opportunity based on this model.Clearly, the model priced LRCX as very overvalued on July 10th when the stock peaked this year.",2024-09-30
"So you downgrade LRCX not before but AFTER a 30% fall in share price?  Is this a joke?Now is the time to be buying, and buying aggressively, not selling. Difficult to take anyone seriously who offers this kind of advice.",2024-09-30

"@Bill the Bag Man I also had a position in KITT and had the opportunity to get in at $0.15 and sell it at $0.35 back in June. Looks like they did a reverse stock split since then. I’m a big believer in autonomous underwater sea exploration but 1) the TAM is only about $2B in 2024 and expected to double by $2029 2) I feel like this sector will be limited to oil and gas exploration, so it’s a niche market in my opinion. 3) I think KITT in particular is going to continue having funding issues simply because they don’t currently have near enough revenue to cover expenses and I don’t see that changing anytime soon. 4) I think investors are seeing KITT as a potential bankruptcy, not that it is warranted. They may very well go on to survive and do well but investors are betting against this probability. If they get delisted then I fear that may be the end of them getting money from capital markets. So your decision to keep holding depends on how much you have invested and your timeframe. If you have a significant amount of money that you could probably take and invest elsewhere I would probably trim this position down 90%. You can keep the remaining for tracking purposes and if they can turn things around then you can always add more back. If they get delisted and go to OTC  then I would liquidate it all. I don’t get involved in over the counter stocks for liquidity concerns.",2024-09-29
"@Natturner1966 on an unrelated topic, I am holding a bag of yuck in the company KITT. Do you see this company ever really amounting to anything? Hard to see visibility going forward- cannot decide whether to cut losses or add more as if has already dropped so much….",2024-09-29
@Bill the Bag Man I would love to get in IBM at under $200. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Much appreciated.,2024-09-29
