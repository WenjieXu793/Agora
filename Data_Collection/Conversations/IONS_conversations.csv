@San Marzano I can't see activist interest unless it's to support a short position.  Management could blow off the best of them.,2024-10-06
"@JMRC Where to begin...?IONS C-suite has been a disaster since Crooke bowed out. They were early out-of-the-gate going woke which is a symptom of lacking discipline and focus on executing a defined core strategy. They have abused the stock option printing press, and it appears investors have simply had enough. Their out-of-the-blue secondary defies ANY clear rationale, and could not have been executed more poorly. The company is a black box that discourages anyone from considering acquisition.ARWR IMO is in the final throws of a 4 year long shake-out from the cult following that was throwing all in when shares were topping $90. Long term shareholders have made CA their foil and the company's financials give some credence to that argument. They may be a more likely target for possible acquisition. Probably worth picking up what you can here below $20.RNA is more likely a story of confidence in the management and their science. Their recent execution of two secondary offerings at sequentially higher new all time highs demonstrated skills mostly unseen in the bio-tech start-up universe. Those looking for the next ALNY may be looking here. If their platform is successful with muscle delivery, they could also be a target for acquisition.I don't know what any type of consolidation would look like, but perhaps a company like IONS still hanging on 30 years in is more a cautionary tale for the entire sector; as more companies going belly-up could counterintuitively  provide more clarity of actual value propositions and investment quality. Finally, far too many bio-tech go public that should be public; it there was really soooo much miracle science being discovered, private capital would be the owners of all these fools-gold mines.",2024-10-04

"For those trying to figure out what is going on with Ionis, look at the article in Arrowhead.  Maybe this pending competition thing is a big part of it.  Or maybe the financing fiasco angered/surprised the market.   (Not sure why this ARWR acticle did not show up under Ionis.   Seeking Alpha does a horrible job posting news and articles that are company or industry related to or mention Ionis).   Anyway...   I am not sure why competition is the topic of the day and it can't be the sole reason for the totality of the recent decline.  We have always known about the pending competition and as I see it,  the market-to-sales time gap is years for most of their new drugs!!!!  I have been a long-time follower of this company and space. Something moved the cheese and I am at a loss to figure it out.  I have never been this upset by the recent decline.  Seems like something is amiss.  For the record, Management has never been good at administrative functions (finance, marketing, legal, HR, PR, IR etc...) I get it, they don't spend money for staffing in those areas.  All good if you ask me as long as the science and drugs move forward.  However, now I am genuinely concerned.  Is this just poor management execution at Ionis or is something big happening to the products and science and/or industry?  I tend to think NOT a science problem.  We have never been so close to success at ionis and competitors.  My guess is that money is leaving the space because the players are not willing to consolidate.  Too headstrong at each of the companies like ALNY, ARWR, RNA, SLN......  I believe it is time for industry consolidation in the RNA and RNAi space.   They are starting to eat one another's success and that deflates industry value, pricing strength and concentrates risk at each individual company.  None of that is good for the RNA space.   The question is who will be bought first???  Big Pharma is not going to buy these companies, they would rather license with all of them or pick and choose among them.  For value generation and preservation, we need consolidation in the RNA space. For that reason, wall street is turning the other way.   I don't care if Ionis acquires or gets acquired.   Just get it over with and hopefully do 50-100% equity deal so the growth stays with the long-term shareholder and keeps the tax collectors at bay.....BTW I think I am venting more than analyzing.  Any other ideas out there?",2024-10-04

@Bio Investor 22 They know or knew in order to obtain fees for selling the secondary they needed a token but rating !,2024-09-14

@Novice77 They have always shown scorn for the stock; years of incessant options cash-outs and now a secondary at $43 in a soft market. Why now? There is no reason to throw this switch now unless you’re being teased by the investment bankers that have them pegged as marks. They are a clown show and Brett Monia is no Sarah Boyce… far from it.,2024-09-10
"@San Marzano May be that's why Crooke stepped down, so they don't have to keep his promise.  No matter how you look at it, this doesn't speak well of how management looks at current stock price.  I will be interested to see how the CEO answers this at the next conference call if someone asks this question.",2024-09-10
