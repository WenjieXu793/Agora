"I've been adding to some existing positions during the recent weakness/lack of love for the sector. I expect it to move bigly with continued inflation, dollar weakness and geopolitical stress.Disc; long/overweight XOM, APA, CVX, OXY, DVN, XLE, ENB, KMI, PSX, NFG, UNG, SU, (OGZPY, LUKOY)",2024-10-06
"Big oil is an in interesting investment and I own most of them, but you must remember these are commodities and price sensitive to the economy. I bought them all when oil crashed to about 30-35 a barrel and the dividend yields were spectacular and the price was low and many SA authors were screaming sell sell sell. That’s when they were attractive. So the morale of the story is wait as long as it takes for oil prices to seriously retreat before buying them.",2024-10-06
"Great homework, great article. CVX is definitely trading at a longterm bargain IMO. All your noted positives plus 37 consecutive annual dividend increases, 4.43% dividend growth rate, expect a lot of deep water start-ups in Gulf of Mexico over next 12-24 months, plus a very underrated/unknowen alternative energy portfolio. Thank you for the article.",2024-10-06
"@Danil Sereda Yeah this entire sector is extremely undervalued. CVX is so low that I had to jump on it at $140.00. The escalating violence between Israel, Hezbollah and Iran could very well result in the IDF targeting of Iranian oil facilities and Iranian mining of the Strait of Hormuz. We also have the ongoing Ukraine war, which has already seen targeting of pipelines in the earlier phase of the conflict- Russian oil being attacked might be the next show to drop. When we consider China’s economy beginning to improve, demand will increase with the fears of shortages. Also consider the increase power demand that will come from all those data centers being built. Sure, renewables are expected to benefit from this, but so will natural gas - yet another area CVX is involved in its upstream side of the house. Timing couldn’t have been better for companies like CVX, EOG and Canadian counterparts such as CNQ and SU. The same goes for the midstreams. Overall this article is perfect for considering future opportunities that are now beginning to emerge ",2024-10-06
"Thanks for your thoughtful analysis of Chevron, which I bought about 3 years ago as part of a 12% energy income allocation in my retirement portfolio (including AM, OKE, PAGP, WMB and KMI).  I knew about zero surrounding energy stocks, but read media reports about a major purchase by Buffett-Berkshire and followed along and bought CVX in low 100s with a 5% dividend raised by 6%, 6% and 8% respectively over the past three years with all proceeds reinvested.  I kicked off another round of buying as the stock fell into the $140s and after reading the latest update in the Value Line Investment Survey, which says the stock will be a market performer over the next 18 months, but has good prospects out to 2027-2029 with a projected price range between $220 and $270 per share.  This seems like a good moment to build or add to a position if you can look ahead for a few years.",2024-10-06
"@InvestorMan Sr. yep. For midstreams, I went with EPD, ET, and WES ",2024-10-06
"I couldn’t agree more here. CVX is dirt cheap, and this is the perfect time to load up on shares before the Middle East escalates further into violence and China’s economy continues to show improvement. The acquisition of HES’ Guyana assets will add even more value (provided XOM’s complaint is dismissed). I started a position in CVX a few weeks ago, and have been steadily adding shares. So far, it’s been a great addition to my portfolio to go with my EOG, CNQ and BTE O&G holdings. If you like CVX as much as I do, then you’ll love CNQ - their oil reserves, focus in areas outside of the Middle East and dividend yield makes it another attractive pick.",2024-10-06
@Money 29 I’d argue it’s undervalued but yeah - a solid stock for sure,2024-10-06
"Fair valuation and a nice yield on dividend aristocrat CVX, solid stock for a long term portfolio.",2024-10-06
"No need to own XLE, just CVX and XOM. Throw in a pipeline company and you have the sector covered.",2024-10-06
"Another superb article, Danil. I agree with you that CVX is a great value stock, and it sports a very nice dividend yield as well. I specifically chose to own CVX over XOM recently.Please allow me to save time this morning so I can get to tennis and football on schedule, by copying and pasting the following comment I just posted on an article  published by JR Research on XOM this morning:""At the moment, I have full positions in CVX and DVN, with a half position in PR for exposure to the Permian Basin. Admittedly, XOM has out-performed all of them over a one month, 3 month, 6 month, or year to date time period.Obviously all of these stocks are highly positively correlated in price with each other, and also highly positively correlated with the price of the underlying commodities that they produce and sell.One of the most important financial metrics that I look at to make investment decisions is the Price/Cash Flow ratio, which is currently 9.57 for XOM, 7.12 for CVX, 6.25 for PR, and 4.41 for DVN. Also, XOM sports the lowest dividend yield in the group.Another reason that I essentially flipped out of XOM and into CVX is because XOM has announced major initiatives to go green by developing, separately, both hydrogen and lithium programs that are going to be expensive and unlikely to produce meaningful revenues for years to come.Finally, I believe that energy is one of the last remaining sectors in which you can find stocks worthy of being purchased at their current prices for income, value and even growth. A wide variety of energy picks comprise more than 25% of the total portfolio of 29 stocks. Midstream pipeline MLPs EPD, ET and MPLX that anchor the energy holdings represent over 10% of total portfolio value. We also have a high conviction regarding the future of natural gas companies, with major bets on EXE (created last week when Chesapeake Energy merged with Southwestern Energy to create Expand Energy) and EOG.""In summary, my views regarding CVX are in sync with your own. CVX is presently one of the Top 5 Holdings in our portfolio. I hope that the foregoing adds value to your fantastic article, Danil.",2024-10-06
Excellent summary of the value proposition that CVX offers at a price under $150.,2024-10-06
"@SuperPac Agreed. I was only commenting as a nat sec issue. An analogous situation is crop exports. That's exportation of water in reality. Given the Ogallala Aquifer is dramatically running out, something to consider restricting.",2024-10-05

@fhbecker that bazooka will be able to stockpile a whole lot of commodities at depressed prices.  Investors heed my warning,2024-10-02
"Today is why CVX is a good buy. Oil went up about 3%? today.. it is still only $71 a barrel.. If Israel goes after Irans oil supply, and Iran chokes off Straight of Hormuz, oil could be twice what it is today..  Even with out war problems in the middle east, oil at 71 is a steal. It is way under valued.",2024-10-01
"@AndrewinCanada @Carr-R The anti-nuclear zealots are financed be same billionaires who finance the anti oil and natural gas industry, pipelines included. They (including the fund run by Al Gore) are betting on renewables and won’t tolerate any competition. Their investments are based on heavy subsidies, thus lots of funds are flowing to support climate change campaigners and political parties with the same agenda willing to spend hundreds of billions.There is new documentary critical of Al Gore books and his sincerity and the author is not afraid of being sued.

"Here is the explanation for not having Hess on the board.""As detailed in the complaint, the merger agreement between Chevron and Hess Corporation requires Chevron to take all actions necessary to appoint Mr. Hess to its Board of Directors. The FTC’s complaint alleges that, as a Chevron Board member, Mr. Hess would gain a much larger platform to amplify his supportive messaging to OPEC and others about OPEC’s market stability goals, increasing the likelihood that Chevron could align its production with OPEC’s output decisions to maintain higher oil prices. The complaint alleges that, given his prior conduct, Mr. Hess’s appointment to Chevron’s Board of Directors would heighten the risk of harm to competition, including meaningfully increasing the risk of industry coordination.The FTC’s proposed consent order would prohibit Chevron from nominating, designating, or appointing Mr. Hess to the Chevron Board, and from allowing Mr. Hess to serve in an advisory or consulting capacity to, or as a representative of, Chevron or the Chevron Board. The proposed consent order would allow Chevron to consult with Mr. Hess and allow him to serve as an advisor, consultant, or representative of Chevron, solely related to interactions and discussions with (a) Guyanese government officials about Hess’s oil-related and health ministry-related activities in Guyana, and (b) the Salk Institute’s Harnessing Plants Initiative.""",2024-09-30
