"Interesting how Mastercard can keep the M&A going while visa gets sued for being too large and anti competitive when theres essentially no difference between V and MA.Which is why I hold both lol.This is the kinda news coverage I come here for SA.Facts and numbers regarding my companies.Sadly ""something something politics"" is what gets all the comments and engagement so this news will be quickly buried in favor of ragebait.Many such cases. Sad.",2024-10-06
"@Philip Mause I agree. Had been long until the yesterday. Sold to capture gains. (glad I did as it's dropped another 3+ this morning.). If the 20% hit to AFFO is close to accurate, I'd be interested again in the 95-ish range. Their earnings call is in about 12 days, will be interesting to see what they have to say then.",2024-10-04
@Filmo There may be an opportunity to get in at a lower price if they cut the dividend but the long term prospects are strong enough to support an entry now at least on a tip toe basis.,2024-10-04
"When Crown got into the fiber business they acquired Lightower for $7.1B, FiberNet for $1.5B, Sunesys for $1B, Wilcon for $600M, they even dumped money into managed solutions and bought VergX. That's well over $10B just in fiber acquisitions, and now they're going to unload the entire fiber business for less? What a shame. The former CEO and management really ran the company into the ground.",2024-10-03
"@El Financeiro correct and the yahoo finance (lol) article that generated this SA report did state that no decision of a sale (of either fiber or small cell) is imminent.  Fiber may be less profitable, but in the end both macro cell towers and small cell are connected to fiber.  You either own the entire value chain or are paying someone else for part part of it…telcos are also expanding fiber and I’m sure are subbing it out to CCI and others…",2024-10-03
So yesterday Reuter started reporting that they're negotiating to sell for around 10 billion the fiber and small cell. An analyst speculates that if it goes through AFFO would be ~20% lower and lead to a dividend cutThoughts?,2024-10-03
@analysis first the discussion here is short-term vs long-term decision.  While the fiber and small cells from a ebitda perspective may not be there.  The small cell business looks to be where the industry is going.  So why sell now while it’s undervalued. There’s really no need for CCI to make a panic move.  They have to think long-term on where the industry is going and stop reacting to short-term headwinds.Revenue 2021 vs 2023    Towers - $3053 vs 3593   18% growth   Small cells - $326 vs $438  34% growth   Fiber - $1177 vs $1257   9% growth Small cells seems to be where the industry demand is expanding to. They can still sell the Fiber business.,2024-10-03
"The Fiber/Cell business doesn't make any money.  $1.2b EBITDA and $1.2b CX and no growth... so that supposed ""growth"" CX is really maintenance.  $8-10 billion for something that generates no FCF sounds like a win, but CCI still overvalued versus comps and who wants to own it now with the sell-the-news holders all waiting for the same event to get out.  Little did they know it's a dividend cut.",2024-10-02
Let’s hope mgmt is smarter than this.  This is a bad deal for shareholders.,2024-10-02
Man I hope they don’t sell this business unit. Hard to see the long-term accretive value of this deal.,2024-10-02
"The sale at this price does not make sense at this time. To me, undervalued",2024-10-02
"That’s bad, only 5 billion? Small cell is the future selling that wouldn’t be a good idea. Took profits on 50% was my #6 position.",2024-10-02
"So less than half of what they invested? A certain dividend cut commensurate to cash flow lost? And taxes on the sale?CCI management, you’re doing a superb job!",2024-10-02
@FirstToThird Thanks for your comment.  It is an undervalued growth stock with a great dividend.,2024-09-19
Great income stock along with AMT in this sector.  Appears SA’s Quant needs some fine tuning as it’s been rated a sell while it’s rebounded 33% from $90 to $120. Direction from new leadership will keep it growing,2024-09-19
It was good to be bearish in 2022. Treasury yields are going to fall ultimately and the div yield is too big to ignore.,2024-09-14
@pakrolltide I’m up 16% plus divs! Patience will be rewarded.  Cell torrows can add more parts and customers and it’s a growth biz,2024-09-13
Great pick Rida! CCI is our #7 positioned stock it’s climbed up! Forward earnings look really good if there accurate I’d expect it back to 150 in 3 years in an up market.,2024-09-13
@CashFlow Hunter I agree. I don’t see much upside in a sale leaseback. But it depends on the numbers.,2024-09-13
@Philip Mause Good luck as stock has gone nowhere like the rest of the REIT universe.,2024-09-13
