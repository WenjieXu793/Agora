"This might be good for HUM. UnitedHealthcare (NYSE:UNH) has become the latest to legally challenge the Medicare Advantage Star Ratings system, which allows health insurers to receive bonus payments from the government.The lawsuit filed by a group of UnitedHealth (UNH) subsidiaries in a Texas district court on Monday alleged that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) unfairly downgraded the insurer's Star Ratings.According to Bloomberg News, which first reported the lawsuits, the UNH units accused CMS of downgrading the company's Star Ratings based on an ""arbitrary and capricious assessment"" of one phone call that lasted less than 10 minutes..",2024-10-04

@d.mas With that type of (fortress) balance sheet they have the time to correct anything that needs to be corrected by 2026. Medicare is a cyclical business (reimbursement rates tend to lag behind utilization / costs): I expect all Medicare focused healthcare companies to see significant (reimbursement) tailwinds in the next 2-5 years.

"@Orangejulius -- It appears finance guys implemented policy and procedures that has destroyed the company.   Losing your Medicare 5% bonus is a major financial hit.  Add in the large and growing number of providers that won't take Humana insurance, or the Medicare fraud settlement, or the considerable problems with Humana's massive Prior Authorization requirements,  it is clearly systematic in Humans' operations.That's going to require cleaning house and getting management that can walk the line between financial objectives and market responsiveness, if it is not too late.  The hits are going to keep on coming as they are losing revenue and cash flow with no fixes in sight.",2024-10-03

"@LTV Capital we'll see.  in the meantime yesterday when i added at 210 i immediately bought december 230 strike calls and closed out when HUM hit 250 yesterday.  plenty of ways to use options ot risk manage.  now have long calls and puts as well into december.  what you saw yesterday at the open was HUGE volume and more buyers then sellers.  when a stock has that kind of volume on a drawdown that large that usually signals support.  my avg price is around 290, i'm patient and will use options to trade around it.",2024-10-03

"@HyGro Amen. If you fight every charge as an insurance company, eventually no one will want to accept your ""services."" Humana's reputation is important, but apparently they don't see it that way.",2024-10-03
"@Headshop I beg to differ.  I have Humana and couldn't be happier.  Last year an ER visit was billed at over $18k and I only paid $138.  It beats the offerings by anyone else in the St. Louis region, especially United and its AARP junk.",2024-10-03

Revenues of $120 billion.Multiple of EV/revenues c. 1/3rd of Cigna's.Either the stock price double or Cigna will buy them out.It will just take some patience and ability to withstand (and maybe take advantage of) downward volatility.,2024-10-03
"Oh no! The insurance provider for our entire military Tricare system is going bankrupt and falling apart.... It should drop another 20% in one day as if it's a penny stock. Humana dropped as if it's headquarters was based in Taiwan and China invaded...Man, that was an easy trade yesterday",2024-10-03
