"@energyguy921 What route are you planning to use?  Outright short, sell calls, buy puts?",2024-10-01
"I totally agree with you putting ""adjusted"" earnings in the spotlight.  For the life of me I cannot understand why shareholders allow their management to report "" we are doing great as we made a nice profit (well if you ignore a lot of labor cost)"".  They do the same thing when they offer convertible loans since they are offering the potential of shares for lower interest rates. I've wondered when some business will report ""adjusted"" gross profit margins where they ignore shares they offer vendors in exchange for lower prices! What a great wat to have industry leading profit margins!  These are practices for poor businesses which struggle to actually make a profit and don't mind grinding their shareholders into the dirt.",2024-10-01
"I think the real story here is a the awful balance sheet (current ratio and long term debt), and digging a bit further, the notes that currently carry a very low rate (~1-3%) , and now we see the cost of new notes is 7%.They are swimming upstream as they battle to turn a profit and fight increased financing costs.",2024-10-01
All of Wayfairs vendors will be affected by the port strike......If its short no impact.If its of significant length Wayfair will lose more than is expected.I'm not a buyer.....,2024-10-01
Some companies are run for the shortsighted insiders by the insiders. Wayfair is a prime example.Ditch this stock?,2024-09-28
"As a customer, I like Wayfair but I would not invest in W for one simple reason...their website is not built to appeal to Gen Z, its simply archaic in appearance and format",2024-09-26
How can this company still be losing money after all these years?  Its scaled as far as it can go...revenues flat...and still not GAAP profitable.,2024-09-25
"Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  The numbers make no sense.  About 400 bill usd + in furniture is sold in the US according to Wayfair's 2022 ar.  So, why would there be a decline in growth post-covid ?  Or during covid (which began in 2019) ?  Who has not heard of Wayfair in NA ?  Amazon relied on word of mouth for decades.  Would not online orders simply be jumping exponentially ?  There must be massive accounting fraud, or sabotage going on.  When did Wayfair move the managing of their website to Google ?  Is that not when Wayfair got rid of the search by camera feature on their website ?  Because Google did not wish Wayfair to compete with them in the search space ?  How does Google control which items customers see on the website ?  By what suppliers pay Google, or by quality and customer satisfaction ?  The company seems to have lost its way since they began to trust Google, which seems to be run by marxist zianists, representing stakeholder (special interests) than profit maximizing (consumer delighting) businesspeople.  If covid19 had not happened, would not sales have continued to grow at 5 bill usd + a year ?  The numbers simply do not make sense no matter what high-falluting terminology language taxonomy the ceo uses.  I think people who commit accounting fraud are going to hell, being liars.  And that is what I suspect has happened.Regards, iRena_D",2024-09-24
I recently took profits on the pop at $ 55 and took a small short........covered my short in the $ 52's but willing to start new shorts at $ 55.W has had a great bounce from lows but running into headwinds from a slowing consumer imo.EDIT: W has $ 700 million note offering today.....don't know if its convertible but suspect that it is.,2024-09-23
@RoyGraham Excellent points. Long-term tells a different story (for now). I'll be sure to update after next earnings. Thanks again for commenting.,2024-09-20
"W has had only one profitable year out of the last ten years.  It is a money losing enterprise.  Why it deserves a ""hold"" rating only rests on hope and ""greater fool"" thinking.  Companies in W position always point to various ""adjusted"" metrics like ""hey look overhear - if we adjust out interest, SBC, etc., we have great prospects""! Next year we'll sell more shares to boost our cash, have more promotions to hopefully keep our revenue from falling and lose more money.  Those loses will be obscured by focusing on more ""adjusted"" metrics and the show will go on.",2024-09-20
"I've made mistakes in investing in retail companies before, but I also have direct consumer experience with W and I see them as the Amazon of home goods... During the pandemic I was able to get W to rapidly deliver quality items for a home renovation (bathroom vanity, lights) and so far every purchase over the last 6 or so years has been excellent. So, quality products delivered in a reliably rapid manner. With their increased efficiencies and nw with declining interest rates and the US economy is solidly good shape, I see W as a safe mid-term opportunity at this price.",2024-09-20
started a small short $ 55++ Its gotten ahead of itself,2024-09-19
"@Clark158f1 What concerns me is that their quarterly revenues are not up on two years.And, sure they have trimmed their losses but still no Net Income.Only difference I can tell is 15% dilution thanks to SBC.Stock may move up or down, sure, and will no doubt.Nonetheless, worthless.",2024-09-13
@TommyIrish My guess is it gives the entire pop back.......even though it went to $ 49 I have no regrets taking profits.,2024-09-13
"@Clark158f1 Yes, relying on US border enforcement. Funny. Maybe marginal benefit to W but hardly $40 to $50!",2024-09-13
W...sold $ 48 pre market....popped on the beat by RH,2024-09-13
"Speculating on CCL again.  Bought last week and am hoping for a pop after the Fed meeting, and then will probably sell.",2024-09-12
