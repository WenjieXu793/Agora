"@jarratta I always liked SHLS and took the opportunity to add when it was at around $12. SHLS has a good track record in execution and margin expansion, though the marco helped. I like their pivot and new strategy. Tempted to add at $5 but worried of the execution risk, with a wholesale transformation ahead and so much on the hopper.",2024-10-05
"@LenV I have zero interest in intention.  I like results.  The company is in a post-Founder transition and has had to manage through some tough times recently.  (It bought tens of millions of dollars of wire that proved to be defective and is having to replace it while it pursues risk mitigation strategies.  Secondly, it has a lot of IP and has had to file an infringement action to protect an intrusion.  A recent ruling was positive.)On an operating level, the company is consolidating its far flung plants into a massive new facility that will be commissioned next year.  The new CEO is impressive and is attracting a lot of talent.Make your own assessment.  I provided the link to the ID event.  You can get a feel by scanning the accompanying presentation and by listening to the first few minutes.",2024-10-04
"@jarratta I hope you're right.  It'll take more than good feelings, though.",2024-10-04
Those who would like to do a deep dive on this company might want to access its inaugural Investor Day by registering here: app.webinar.net/... SHLS has multi-decade roots.  It did well as supplier of products to automotive OEMs before transitioning to the solar industry.   It now dominates a large-scale commercial sub-sector.  I feel positive about its prospects.,2024-10-03
