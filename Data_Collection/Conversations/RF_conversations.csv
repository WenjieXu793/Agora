"@FirstToThird appreciate your feedback, and that you recognized the value of specific regional banks with strong fundamentals.",2024-09-26
Thanks for the coverage..as NII improves with falling rates RF will be cracking out cash and another divvy increase.…great to see it’s other units are performing well…this is a strong regional bank…have held it since b4 the 2008 crisis and its many acquisitions over the years…great divvy holding….Long RF!!,2024-09-26
"The only lesson learned from 2008 is that bubbles need to be even bigger so yes easy to understand the push back against consolidation lest everyone jump aboard the whole *""Intel the entire US economy!""* craziness. Short $gs Goldman Sachs strong sell. *SOMETHING* needs to be done about New York City Community Bank. Force Goldman Sachs to buy that is my solution and *MAKE* GS become a Bank. The whole reason to create the mania in the first instance is to make a fortune in the ensuing bust. Banks don't do that $gs does that. Long $wec Wisconsin Energy strong buy. One way to solve the so called ""electricity crisis that can only be solved by nuclear power"" is to use a brand new coal fired solution not that Pennsylvania would ever try that of course. Long $mdu strong buy that one supports the local economy big time.",2024-09-26
@The Investment Doctor I like your logic but let’s see.I like my 6.78% yield for 5 years which will be reduced by few points due to 80 cent premium I paid,2024-09-19
"@U6439892  I doubt we will see $30 within 3 years of the call date. At $30, in 2026, the yield to call would be 0.25%.To get a 4% YTC in 2026, you'd be at $27.10ish.Your odds to see it go to $30 way sooner than $30 are better than in 2026. Not only because the yield to call will come into play, but also because the reset-game will begin to play. I like your potential for capital gains, don't get me wrong. But $30 in 2026 is a stretch as the YTC will play a dominant role.",2024-09-19
"@The Investment Doctor Yes - I understand. In fact I bought my shares at $25.80So I have already assumed that I will lose $0.80 as capital loss. However if the neutral Fed rate is 3.00-3.25, then the price may climb to $30 by mid 2026. At that point I will sale some of my holding to compensate for the $0.80 premium I paid.So I could earn still earn 6.78% for 5 years which is much higher than CD rates which will go down further",2024-09-19
"@Vlae Kershner  Sounds about right, I didn't run the numbers in detail on this week's share price. I just wanted to make sure U6 understood the implications and that while he may be certain of a 6.7% yield until 2029, there is a possibility he'll incur a capital loss at the end of that term, and it shouldn't be a straight comparison with a CD investment.",2024-09-18
@The Investment Doctor I get a 5.80% yield to worst if it's called in 2029.,2024-09-18
"@U6439892  Again, keep in mind there will be a capital loss if the stock gets called in 2029. Take that into consideration in your scenario as well.",2024-09-18
"Fed projections envision a year-end policy rate of 4.25% to 4.5%.With this target rate, 6.95% is very attractive. So the even if price goes to $30 the yield will be 5.78% and still much attractive",2024-09-18
This administration is doing everything they can to prevent corporate mergers. One problem with this is how they going to get those higher taxes from corporations if they prevent them from making money.,2024-09-17
My only surprise is that there was nothing in there about the impact of bank mergers on climate change.Yellen yaps about the role of climate change in Treasury decisions all the time...,2024-09-17
"Short the banks. With this new rule, and the rule for increased reserve requirements, in addition to the massive upside-down portfolios the banks hold in bonds and real estate, there is a major downside brewing up in the banking sector.",2024-09-17
@U6439892  you'll also endure a capital loss of 3% in 2029 in case it gets called. But yes. You got it.,2024-09-16
@The Investment Doctor So if one buys it at todays price of $25.70 - one gets yield of 6.78% for 5 years - much better than 5 year CD with possibility of appreciation and flexibility of selling when needed,2024-09-16
"@U6439892  Not callable until 2029, so your first five years are pretty much guaranteed.",2024-09-15
"Are these shares recallable early?Or guaranteed to stay for at least 5 years?If Fed reduces the rates few times in coming quarters, this will look expensive for the bank",2024-09-15
