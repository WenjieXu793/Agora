"@rentierparasite - Two things -- 1) bot should cost much less than Pointy2) bot market is global vs. effectively just North America for PointyPS. Fetching the mail will be valued much more than making an omelet, since the neighbors can see it :)",2024-10-06
"@Condemnant Quod Non Intellegunt - Just more single month cherry-picked BS. Spain is one of Tesla's best countries in Europe, but they do not sell more BEVs than everyone else combined. They have 26.4% BEV share YTD, up from 22% last year:  eu-evs.com/...Tesla has 16.3% BEV share this year in the 15 European countries EU-EVs tracks, second place behind VW Group:  eu-evs.com/...Counting all plug-in EVs in all of Europe, Tesla is in a 4-way race for 2nd place with 10.9% share:  cleantechnica.com/...",2024-10-06
"@Maxed Out Mama definitely! Just a few days ago, Tesla issued another $780 million debt. More debts to come as revenue and margin are softening.",2024-10-06
"Beware of going for low hanging fruit. Tesla is now back in the win column against BYD, they are trying to go up against Toyota and have transitioned to making more hybrids. This leaves the door wide open for Tesla. We all should know that hybrids are a transition mechanism (yes, because of costs and poor charging infrastructure) to where we will eventually end up. Once the two issues are fixed we will resume the eventual takeover of electric everything. And yes, we will eventually find a better way to power the grid. Eventually. “Tesla beats BYD 3Q”Via The Electric Vikingyoutu.be/...",2024-10-06
"@The Real Cavalier Of course I disagree. This was a tough year for all manufacturers with high inflation in the last 3 years eating away at people's discretionary spending and high interest rates. As the economy recovers, auto sales will increase next year. But the really big issue is public charger availability. There has to be chargers everywhere with people able to plug in conveniently anywhere they shop, work, vacation. If enough chargers are built, ICEs will die off.",2024-10-06
@Roy_H It seems that Tesla's U.S. sales have flattened out.  I think it's going to be hard to increase them with the current offerings.,2024-10-06
@Tdot I'm pretty sure Tesla is losing money this year ex-credits.,2024-10-06
"@longnose Even if Tesla delivers a mind blowing product, it still needs to get permitted by local & state governments.I personally don't think Tesla is close to delivering a usable L4 product.  I'd guess at least a year, maybe 2.Then they have to build a business plan to make it work.  Which seems like a big stretch at this point.",2024-10-06
@JRP3 what companies?  And how much are they paying? What kind of revenue is this actually bringing in?,2024-10-06
"@solucky Well, he said the 25K thing was out. So I guess we wait and see.",2024-10-06
"@CuongLe You bring up an important point, which is the capital investment required to bring these magnificent robotic visions to some sort of viable product. It is massive. If you look at what Waymo is spending, and even Apollo, one catches a clue. But Tesla's cars don't even handle variable speed limits or school buses or emergency vehicles, nor do they even detect some forms of road obstacles. Tesla has a very long way to go. This has baffled me - Musk doesn't want to spend the capital for new production lines for new vehicles, but at the 2 million a year level (which they have not yet reached), I do not think they have the capital or the cash flow to reach autonomous driving - and the robots are far harder. Now at 4-5 million vehicles a year with okay margins it looks a lot more feasible. Three million a year would certainly help. The large Chinese loan (2.5 billion USD) Tesla drew last quarter surely has something to do with those 5-Year/0 Interest loans. It's amazing how little comment that generated. The way I see it, Tesla is going to be cutting into cash this year and the next.",2024-10-06
@Entreri Tesla sells very well in China and is inexpensive. 2 Strikes for you...,2024-10-06
@Amateur1 If EV Credit is removed it hurts other companies more than it hurts Tesla.,2024-10-06
@Brucejfern Tesla already has one of the cheapest EV you can buy in America...,2024-10-06
"Tesla showed their very first bottom line net profits from manufacturing and selling BEVs (ex-govt subsidies and handouts) in 2Q21, once the Shanghai plant had ramped up to mass production and cleared most of the COVID shutdowns and disruptions.  By then the employees were living in dormitories in the plant, to avoid exposure.",2024-10-06
"Based on the basic fundamentals such as trailing earnings and shareholder equity net book value, Tesla as a ""legacy"" like Ford would be priced at around $20 per share.",2024-10-06
"@Truthteller Yet the reviews from actual companies using them are quite good, so clearly, unlike you, Tesla knew exactly what they were doing when they chose the pack size.  As you should know by now if you've been paying the least bit attention you don't build an EV with the least amount of mileage if you want it to be usable in various situations and want the pack to last.  The ""500"" mile range pack means you don't have to use the last electron on each trip, have a buffer, can take a higher charge rate, and stress the pack less with each use.  It also means the truck can make multiple runs each day.",2024-10-06
"@The Real Cavalier ""It's pretty bizarre that Tesla is relying on such a dated lineup.""People who follow Tesla are aware that Tesla does constant innovation and improves their cars all the time. The new cars are far superior to the old cars, it is just that they don't look dramatically different. Many think that new has to look different, and the mechanicals underneath can remain the same. Different strokes for different fokes.",2024-10-06
@solucky It's pretty bizarre that Tesla is relying on such a dated lineup.  Some really good vehicles are coming out in 2025.,2024-10-06
"@Condemnant Quod Non Intellegunt "" Tesla Cybertruck drives from San Francisco to Los Gatos completely hands free with zero interventions on FSD 12.5.5""Might be a legal drive in the US...in Germany 90% unlegal with using the middle lane the whole time.",2024-10-06
