@BklynDave1 Because it’s a phenomenal product and people would rather buy it than Apple Music or Amazon music or Google or whatever they throw in their bundles.,2024-10-01
"@K SA 01 yes, that’s my thinking  is if it was a Buy  before, and the price drops more , than a good time to add more.I made a comment to him in a different thread of his that  I am adding to a couple of his recommendations and adding also to SPOT if it dipped more.He replied that he does not own SPOT and it was on me if I wanted to buy SPOTSo I thought I would post my comment in the appropriate thread for context.",2024-09-27
"@Ajarn Brian Hope you don't mind me jumping into the conversation.Its been only 3 days (Sep. 24, 2024 10:57 AM ET) since this article was written. These investments take some time to become profitable. There will be ups and downs meanwhile. I do a few checks after I read articles on SeekingAlpha and that sometimes takes 2 days to 2 weeks. Meanwhile prices go up and down. I have accepted that. Its very hard to time everything perfectly. Hope this helps. Best of luck in your investments. - Kris",2024-09-27
I bought an initial position in this when you first recommended it.It looks like it’s retreating a little bit(normal)I will wait a little bit before adding more.Do you still feel this stock  is a Buy?,2024-09-27
"I plan to use the money I make from your suggestions to join your investment group at the end of this year - through the sum of several investments Up $1,618 on RKLB in 1 weekDown $160  on LUNRPDD was my choice, just reinforced what I already planned to doPlan to buy SPOT and PTON todayI’ve been looking at SPOT, but PTON I would never look at before",2024-09-26
"@LenceFlatu ''Apple is clearly The Big Player''Apple The Big Player? In music? What?!Never paid a dime for Apple Music. Don't even know anyone who has.I'm sorry to be blunt. I'm very sorry, but do you spend any time thinking before you talk?",2024-09-25
"Spotify as a pure play music greatly simplifies the matter as talk about the proverbial Phoenix from the Ashes of just 2 Years ago absolutely. These ""pro independent labels"" in music no better place to be than that. Having seen what Netflix has done and obviously $spot was absolutely brutal in letting people go in the crash so what their game plan is going forward will be interesting to learn about. Apple is clearly The Big Player by far in this one but $spot might find itself able to team up with anyone not named here as well. Really do find Nokia and Blackberry as interesting way to play this as Microsoft still nowhere to be seen in the handset business despite saying otherwise. Sony is another one just not really doing anything. John Malone made some noise today as usual near completely ignored. Long $rklb rocket lab strong buy",2024-09-24
"@Michael, liked your thesis. Thinking of initiating a position. Been watching SPOT for a while. Not sure when to buy as it keeps going up. A good problem to have - Kris",2024-09-24
@qwerty11 is that your bear case for the stock - a new competitor entering the music streaming space?,2024-09-17
"Yes, no one will ever invent an alternative music streamer, this one will go on forever!",2024-09-16
Valuation? Multiples? Margin of safety? Etc. would be helpful. Thanks.,2024-09-14

"Spotify's problem is that they operate in the music publishing industry which is inhabited by neanderthal companies.  Essentially, the music publishing companies annointed Spotify as the go to platform for their signed artists who, of course, get a special back door lane for promotional purposes.  Independent artists are dealing with a playing field heavily stacked against them by having to fund their entire promotional campaigns for their own music with heavy spending, no professional guidance in an environment teeming with people who want to make money providing services to them. It is only recently that it dawned upon the Sony/ATV suits that if they offered a bunch of money to the Gallaghers that they would make it all back and more since they own all the royalty rights to the Oasis back catalog.  The entire industry, including Spotify, would be much more successful if they launched a long term campaign to convert the Boomer/Gen X generations to primary Spotify users and streaming royalties through the publishers would increase significantly.  Also, removing the roadblocks to the development of independent artists would benefit the entire industry greatly.  The problem is that most capitalists view artists, teachers, movie directors, actors, musicians, physicians, plumbers, electricians and software engineers as labor costs to be controlled in the name of profit.  How many good movies have you seen since the pandemic started?",2024-09-13
Amazon was beat-up when the CEO was fuzzy on the next Q after beating earnings with $1.25 eps vs .$98. It was a gift by the CEO to Wall Street so they could load  up on Amazon shares at $165 instead of paying $200. It probably happens all the time!,2024-09-11
"T is no joke, unless you don't like a hefty dividend and refocused attention after years of going off course. In a FED rate lowering environment, that yield is going to look a lot more valuable and T seems content again to be a boring telecom utility cash cow. What's not to like?",2024-09-11
"@Callitlikeitis Stocks go up and down, but reinvested dividends pay off in spades if they are reinvested when the stock is in the doldrums and then takes off. I bought a couple of utility stocks (EIX, PEG) when I was younger and I have been astounded at how reinvesting reaps rewards. Of course, reinvesting in T when it slid for years due to CEO pipedreams probably was a mistake. So even with dividend payers you have to pay attention.",2024-09-11
@Callitlikeitis Right. But this only works if the stock eventually goes up more than the loss created. Wouldn't it just make more sense to invest in a better company even without a dividend?,2024-09-10
"@the real Jake Malloy If management is good, Free Cash Flow/profit stay good your, dividend keeps coming, low stock price with re-invest buys stock faster thus low price can be good.",2024-09-10
"@the real Jake Malloy depends on your objective, time frame involved. I’ve done well over the decades reinvesting in stocks with solid fundamentals that hit anir pockets and dipped for variable time frames. Lowered the cost average, total shares increased - divi amt received goes up… solid company finally catches a long term bid and I finally look smart. Again, varies based on several factors…",2024-09-10
"Technology, Media, and Telecom. What’s the point of lumping those together? I guess the Telecom Services sector wasn’t a big enough mishmash of unrelated stocks already.",2024-09-10
