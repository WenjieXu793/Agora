"I would like to see your data on 8x being “historical “. They’ve been a public company since 1983, uninterrupted. I think it’s a mistake to focus on the past 10 years if that is what you are doing., especially without providing context. Stock has been in a bear market for most of that time. 2014 to 2020 was a structural anomaly in which retail business across the spectrum were being put out of business by hyper competition in digital  channels. WSM emerged from this challenge stronger than ever, as demonstrated by their sticky margin profile. 2021 to 2023 we now know was a complete under-rating by investors and analysts who had to dramatically reverse course to correct their mistake. I personally believe WSM is on the cusp of a prolonged bull market after being ignored and under appreciated for the past 10 years.",2024-09-11
