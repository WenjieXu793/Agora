"In reality, this is no different than a debit card transaction where purchases are immediately paid by the purchaser's bank account.  In contrast, charging purchases to a credit card provides nearly 60 days of float before purchases are debited to the purchaser's bank account.  Using a credit card also results in a mileage or a cash back credit.",2024-09-21
"@Haoleboy2 - Agree.  It will take time but it is a start to breaking the oligopolistic pricing control of the two networks and their puppet masters.  It doesn't have to replace debit/credit cards, it only has to force the networks/puppet masters to cut pricing.  For example, they don't need to compete in the cash back components.  They could offer loyalty points or lower prices only to those that pay with this service.With that said, I think this biggest growth area for the instant-pay-by-bank will be in the B2B segment.  This is an area that the networks have not been able to crack because their outlandish fees make no business sense for large value, repeat ticket transactions.",2024-09-20
"@Dollarsandcents Sure, merchants can do a lot of things. The issue though is that merchants first and foremost...want to get paid. You know how long it took people to move away from checks to debit cards? Do you know how impractical it will be to explain to someone in the checkout - hey initiate a payment through you bank, you'll get a notification on your bank app that you will have to accept, along with some legal terms and then wait until the payment goes through.The issue with these stories is that they only talk about the ""benefit"" to merchants and not the actual implementation and experience of the customer. The reason customers aren't paying with their bank today (which Walmart offers) isn't because ""it takes 2 days to process"" it's because they have their debit card in their pocket and it works. More importantly, they understand how it works.Here's the deal, people don't like that Visa and MC are monopolies on payments. But here's a simple plan - just create a global payment network that always works, allows you to pay in just about any currency, gives you real-time verification of funds, and offers consumers both dispute support and (mostly) rewards. Tell me how long (and how much money) that will take to build and get back to me.If you want to be mad at the banks for taking the big bulk of the interchange, that's fine. They also take the credit risk for all the people who don't pay their bills. But being upset at Visa and Mastercard because they built something amazing that just works everyday for just about anyone on the planet is insane to me.",2024-09-20
"@Haoleboy2 Here's my thoughts on it.  Yes, Walmart could come up with some kind of reward program for their shoppers but UNLIKE VISA they can't use those benefits at their other millions and millions of merchant locations.  Hence, it boxes you in to 1 retailer.  My Evergreen Visa saves me 2% back on every purchase where ever I use it.  I shop at Walmart but in the grand scheme of things its a pittance compared to all the other places I use my Visa card.",2024-09-20
@dynx you are correct but …… I think wal mart is eyeing what business and wants to be in that business - they think they can do it better and capture that profits - this seems to be inking two in a nine inning game Anyone like this company as an investment ??,2024-09-20
@ChuckXX just trying to look forward - this seems like a great first step for wal mart and other big players to out the credit card companies - if Visa can give you 2 percent cash back by using their services then who is to say that wal mart can’t tie in their own promotions / incentives ?Maybe I am all wet but this seems like a much bigger deal once you really think about it,2024-09-20
"@PanicFirst Not sure how it makes budgeting easier as its just a transfer of money from your account to Walmarts account.  To my way of thinking its just ""much ado about nothing"".  Walmart has a reputation for hating the credit card companies.",2024-09-20
@mattderron - but merchants don't have to accept debit cards.  They can replace their debit card acceptance with this service. They could even tie in the merchant's loyalty points program to compete with the cash back programs of high fee credit cards. The money stays in house.I hope Walmart and the other large merchants succeed in stopping the oligopistic practices of MC/Visa and their puppet masters. Comrade Kahn at the FTC has been chasing windmills instead of going after the networks and their puppet masters.,2024-09-19
"Their account updates in real time...kind of like when they use their debit card today then?Merchants always talk about card fees being a problem, but they've provided near global ubiquity of payments. People who don't want to use credit are already using their debit card. People who use credit, don't want this.It's a solution looking for a problem, which is why usage of RTP and FedNow is so low. Banks have zero incentive to sign on or promote it since this will be a net cost to them (initiating a real-time payment) as opposed to a net gain (debit / credit interchange).This use case is DOA unless consumers decide they want worse protections with no rewards and banks decide they only want to lose money now. Total non-starter.",2024-09-19
Good for Walmart. Hope more of the large merchants that are still in a lawsuit with Visa and MasterCard come on board.  I have never understood while the marxist Lina Khan goes after big tech but does nothing to significant price fixing Visa and Mastercard who act on behalf /controlled by the Big Banks.,2024-09-19
Why would anyone want to do this? I prefer my $ to stay in my interest bearing account for as long as possible plus get my points on my CC.,2024-09-19
@ChuckXX for someone that doesn't have a credit card.  or for someone that wants to use a savings account.a person could have a bank account that is only for walmart.  for some people it may make budgeting easier.more payment options is good.,2024-09-19
@Jamesa1974 Well step one will be “bend over” I’ll let you guess the next steps.,2024-09-19
"If Walmart still wants to also accepts cards, then they are not allowed to offer a different price for other payment methods. Thus credit card will always be the most beneficial option to the customer, due to cashback. Credit card companies somehow managed to put a stranglehold that should not have been possible.",2024-09-19
@trentbridge yea they could.  If they wish to:1. extend credit so people don’t need to check their bank balance before purchase.2. match the purchase protections offered by the credit card companies.3. give points that favor those that don’t need to do #1 above.Credit cards are sticky for a lot of reasons.This looks more like a negotiation tactic.Incase that wasn’t clear:  poor people won’t use this because they’ll overdraw their accounts.  Rich people won’t use this because they get points and purchase protection with CCs.,2024-09-19
"Exactly what people want, direct exposure to their cash. Genius",2024-09-19
Didnt walmart try dodging visa/mastercard/amex before and it ended about as well as their attempt to set up shop in germany?,2024-09-19
But please tell me a valid reason WHY I would want to do that.  So I really want to miss out on my 2% cash back???   NO THANK YOU.,2024-09-19
"Will Walmart offer a discount for using this service since they will be saving money. My CC gives a 1.5% kickback, what will WMT offer?",2024-09-19
"Interesting - the revolution in banking and credit has just begun.  This is where big businesses assess the need to pander to the banks on credit card fees.  WMT or APPL or  META could easily scoop up an online finance outfit lie PYPL, SOFI or DAVE and eliminate the need for customers to bank with real banks.",2024-09-19
