Much like Pfizer added BMY when no one wanted it. If you want make money in the stock you must remember the Buffett rule: price is what you pay. Value is what you get.,2024-10-06
@Fieldstone Partners my Abbv hold for a while. A good dividend and growth stock. Just added PFE and BMY. Hope they will have a similar outcome as Abbv did.,2024-10-06
I own BMY and PFE. I have  small loses. Love those dividends and will hold for Cap. Gains.,2024-10-06
"@AndreP Yes, I'm quite sure. I can count fairly well.I don't know why you ask.I don't own OXY or NPWR. Maybe there are others that you think I own, but don't.",2024-10-06
"@ndardick Hey, my friend, are you sure you only have 29 stocks? I seem to be following in your footsteps. All good of course. Both PFE and BMY and OXY, NPWR etc, etc. Have a good Sunday.",2024-10-06
"@jansdirk You are absolutely 100% correct that PFE offers a similar opportunity for income, value and appreciation potential as BMY. In fact, I am a little more excited about the oncology pipeline at PFE that includes the antibody drug conjugates acquired with Seagen last fall, which are designed to kill evil cancer cells while leaving nearby healthy cells intact.",2024-10-06
"I agree that BMY, with an ""A"" credit rating, offers a compelling bargain for income, value and growth, particularly with the potential revenue from the FDA approved schizophrenia drug Cobenfy that the CEO of the BMY recently stated might offer favorable indications for people on the autistic spectrum as well. Accordingly, I have accumulated enough shares of BMY under $50 per share to make it one of our 10 top holdings in our portfolio of 29 stocks.",2024-10-06
"By the way, more or less the same applies for PFE.Good luck!",2024-10-06
"@Fieldstone Partners Why?Looking at its chart since 1995 on SA, I notice that $BMY will reach $80 in the next 10 years. Currently at $53.What it could not do for the last 30 years, what catalysts/management/future-potential that you see that did not exist in the last 3 decades?Trying to understand.TIA.",2024-10-06
"And last but not least: such a big company with the track record, is a candidate to keep in portfolio for very long time, sleep well and collect the dividends.",2024-10-06
Fully agree: started to buy a while ago and apparantly still to be increased. Thanks,2024-10-06
"@Millennial Investment The CVR anticipated diligent efforts. BMY's BLA for ide-cel was given a refuse-to-file designation for being materially deficient. That is quite rare. That is an example of lacking diligent efforts. Sorry, I ruined your comment section experience by using imprecise language.",2024-10-06
@Millennial Investment There are strict FDA safety controls in manufacturing that Celgene just ignored.,2024-10-06
"@Jacob Olson “Which is the typical approval timeline when the company is actually trying to get the drug approved”This statement needs rephrasing. There is a timeline for FDA decision on approval, but it is far from guaranteed and is not based on a company “trying”. Biologics are difficult to manufacture at scale. So, many BLAs have delays on approval related to manufacturing. This was not surprising (especially in 2019/2020). No side here, just love pharma and the discussion. Cheers all.",2024-10-06
"@Jacob Olson I don't take part in frivolous lawsuits. An example is I used JNJ baby powder. Not gonna be suing them. This CVR lawsuit is similar to buying out of the money call options that gave you a nice gain (in this case $2.50) that you let expire because you were hoping for an even bigger gain if the company released some news before the expiry. Why didn't you take the sure thing? CVRs are like options; high probability of losing everything.I actually believe because this is so frivolous that anyone taking part should be held liable for court and legal costs when they lose. When UMB refiles with the registered holders names in the suit, BMS should sue each of those parties named in the suit. Put liens on their houses and property. That is probably why UMB used the beneficial names in the first filing.",2024-10-05
"@dbcoin So you opt out of all securities class actions lawsuits? I only had a small position. I am not going to rehash all of the filings. You can read them yourself. We can agree to disagree. But the ""covid"" and ""force majeure"" statements are still hogwash.",2024-10-05
"@Jacob Olson so sue Celgene. They wrote the submissions and were maintaining the facilities after the buyout. They were a horrible purchase by BMS and caused the stock to plummet. Their culture was terrible. I am amazed the FDA didn't shut them down when they were Celgene. Can't prove ""intent"". BMS can't be proven that they intentionally slow walked the process. Do you have a smoking gun proving they did?Gilead wasn't integrating a new company into their culture when the drug was submitted. So using that as an example is a poor comparison.Bottom line, you could have sold in December of the final year for $2.50 and didn't. You rolled the dice. You lost. Man up and take responsibility. If you lose the CVR case, are you willing to pay legal fees and court costs?",2024-10-05
@D_DAYTRADER It IS mind boggling....a P/E of 108x. That's a lot of expectational euphoria. I wonder which drug induces that.,2024-10-05
"@dbcoin Read the complaint ""Bristol-Myers failed to use Diligent Efforts to achieve the Liso-cel Milestone by, among other things, submitting an inadequate Liso-cel BLA to the FDA, causing a major amendment to the Liso-cel BLA (which, in turn, triggered a threemonth extension to the Liso-cel PDUFA date), failing to maintain the Juno Facility and Lonza Facility adequately, failing to prepare those facilities for inspection by the FDA, and inadequately responding to at least some of the FDA’s findings""For all of you saying ""covid"" and no ""force majeure"" clause. Gilead's BLA submission date for Tecartus was 8 days before Liso-cel in Dec 2019. Tecartus was approved by the FDA on July 24 2020. Which is the typical approval timeline when the company is actually trying to get the drug approved.""Was it BMY who bundled all 3 drugs into the deal rather than 3 separate payouts?""Yes, they were a party to the CVR and likely the party that wanted the all or nothing provision.",2024-10-05
@Jacob Olson How so? Was it BMY who rolled the dice and didn't add a force majeure clause? Was it BMY who bundled all 3 drugs into the deal rather than 3 separate payouts? Did BMY invent Covid so as to delay the FDA in their inspections? Was it BMY who told you not to sell in December of the year they expired at $2.5? Does BMY have control over how fast the FDA acts?,2024-10-05
