"Great analysis - put out all the financials in a very useable way, with guides to interpreting each component.  Thank you.  I wonder about the compelling business proposition going forward.  OKTA's product is extremely pervasive, at the center of firms of all sizes onboarding and tech operations.  It can be considered part of the security suite, though it really has a backbone of simplifying access, and therefore management to various products and licenses the firm's users (IT Departments) have to pay for.  Great position to have, yet one that by its nature can be untenable, as competition erodes market share, and organic growth not dependent on positive headcount changes takes constant product innovation.  Does anyone know what is next on the horizon?  Is there a new product initiative that either allows the company to expand adjacently (whether a deeper horizontal deployment or a new vertical)?  Are there customer bases that have high CAC to LTV rations but still offer up a large growth opportunity when considered holistically?  I don't know but am soliciting any thoughts from readers to help determine what my future hold strategy should be on this.Great work, Juxtaposed, I will enjoy following you.",2024-10-05
"I was much more of a fan of OKTA before its data was hacked in one division, and played OKTA by selling out of the money puts rather than by owning the stock outright. I think the data breach led many investors to become less trusting of the protection that OKTA affords its customers, who have other choices.I am not sure OKTA is now fully de-risked and compelling. However, with the stock closing at $72.30 today, CFRA has a 12-month price target of $91 and Morningstar has a Fair Value Assessment of $100.Also, I took a look at the December $70 puts, which can be sold for $4.30. That is not sufficient to meet my threshold for selling puts, as it represents a potential annualized return of less than 30% with downside protection of less than 10%. That sometimes means that a stock has indeed bottomed, because it evinces a lack of investors seeking to pay for insurance against a further drop in the price of the underlying stock.",2024-10-04
"@Blo65 Agree completely, but mr market consistently seems to overlook this so long as revenue growth is sustainable. In this case, Okta, as they have now matured, is transitioning from growth (<20% yoy) to value, in which case they need to start to focus on shareholder yield & 'get fit' on the expense side as many like to say. The intrigue of SaaS has been the subscription revs, & thus scalability w/ operating leverage. I cant fathom how so many of these businesses still remain unprofitable at a size like this. Very hard to find similar businesses that are reward shareholders and focused on cost control",2024-10-04
"@Amrita Roy  Looks interesting. $650M yr of SBC on $1.9B Net Sales seems pretty greedy. I think the continued dilution should be taken into account, especially with the company now more mature at +$11B & fcf growth slowing to <15%. Valuation really needs to come down another 10-15% imo",2024-10-03
I am relatively optimistic about short-term economic activity but I am not sure what will happen if tariffs are widely imposed and the US backs away from international obligations after this election. OKTA might see some benefits from increased security spending but most of its market will be struggling to adapt to changing global economic activity. Watchlisted OKTA for now since I want to be at least optimistic enough for a Strong Buy to put capital into play.,2024-10-03
"@Gary Alexander Okay, so I get scared in tech when a bull argument is built on valuation because things change so quickly. Iâ€™d rather buy a premium product at a fair price.",2024-10-02
"@Fred. L. The competition is made up of much smaller companies like Duo and Auth0. Small percentage of TAM is due to the fact that adoption is still low. Okta focuses on securing cloud logins. Migrations away from on-prem and custom enterprise apps and over to cloud-based apps for everything from sales & marketing (Salesforce) to ERP and Finance (Workday), for example, is still ongoing. Okta installs happen after a company has amassed a collection of web-based tools and needs an SSO solution to secure their logins across apps.",2024-10-02
@ChristianDe Interesting. I'm still bullish on PANW and expect ARR growth from its platformization progress next quarter but I guess we'll have to wait and see. Check out my article and let me know your thoughts,2024-09-26
"@The Techie In my portfolio you will also find CrowdStrike,  Cloudflare and Zscaler. I recently sold out of Palo Alto Networks.",2024-09-26
@ChristianDe Yes- that's a smart move. Are you currently looking at any other cybersecurity names? I'm bullish on CrowdStrike and Fortinet,2024-09-26
Is interesting that the new FBI HQ is in Maryland actually so this should come as a surprise to no one now. Not really sure how Virginia is right proper handling of Spaceport Virginia other than to say New York State doesn't have one of those either just a Mayor now about to spend the rest of his life in Prison. Long US Treasuries strong buy. Short gold strong sell. Does New York State even have an energy plan?,2024-09-26
@Stock Scanner it is not expensive... it is just growing its TAM by eatiing off the shares of legacy competitors and making new markets for itself... it is a great company with very effective strategy and product(s),2024-09-25
"Looks like another company missed their payment to the ""Big Guy""",2024-09-25
"Okta is already beaten down, but NOW is trading high at 200x GAAP earnings, and the stock could very well halve and still be expensive.",2024-09-25
"I don't see how such a highly speculative news with an evidently limited effect on one of the most diversified by revenue company could justify the fall by 4% premarket... If it goes even lower, there will be an excellent buying opportunity of a very qualitative stock.",2024-09-25
I agree with you and I am already long $OKTA.,2024-09-12
"@Ahirani Down about 19% ytd in an up market isn't all that steady. With that said, it looks like a buy at this beaten-up level.",2024-09-11
