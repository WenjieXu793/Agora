"@Capital_management I’m selling and will use the proceeds to invest in other utilities such as AEP, DUK, or DTE which have been proven winners for me over the same time period and continue to have share price appreciation and pay growing dividends.  Funny you mention MSFT because I’ve also owned them even longer than PPL and never plan on selling.  Absolutely no comparison or parallels to PPL.",2024-09-04
@Abullman EPS moved nowhere as well so what did you expect? You should sell it many years ago already. And now you want sell just when company finally starts to perform? Reminds me people who sold Microsoft in 2014 because they finally break even.,2024-09-03
"PE in October was around 15. One of cheapest utilities in SPY, also one of the higher growing one.Today it has PE 19 which is still cheaper than many peers which are expected to grow at slower rate.I don't really understand why you think that PPL wasn't attractive in October. I'm also confused why do you compared it with bind yields. 3.5% dividend plus 7% EPS growth is far above any government bonds.20Y average PE is low but PPL had also junk fundamentals during most of that period so it's not telling much about new PPL with growing earnings. It's like valuing IBM based on average PE during years of declining earnings.",2024-09-03
I’ve owned shares of PPL since 2013 and they have gone nowhere.  I thought maybe when they divested their UK holdings that some appreciation would occur.  There has been some recently but with the dividend cut it has turned into the worst performing utility by far in my portfolio.  If it can get to $33 I’m selling as then I would finally break even in my IRA.,2024-08-28
