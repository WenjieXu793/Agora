"Another thing to point out in regards to the commercialization of phosphorescent blue, is that UDC has said it is confident it will also be able to supply a blue host for its customers.Ten years ago UDC lost green host to competitors, and it accounted for a third of their sales - according to UDC's CFO, in a past interview.""Host materials play a crucial role in the emissive layer in OLEDs. They assist in transporting electrons and holes efficiently and are therefore described as ambipolar. Host materials transfer energy to the light-emitting molecules/dopants and in some cases, a single molecule can serve as both the host and emitter. On top of this they can stabilize the charge carriers to promote longevity as well as efficiency.""",2024-08-29
