"May I posit a thought here as to why Warren Buffett may be more risk averse at this time!The yield curve says it all!!The beginning of August saw the 3-year Treasury rise above the 10-year Treasury: in effect it 'uninverted'.On Friday, September 5, the 2-year Treasury rose above the 10-year Treasury: in effect it too 'uninverted'.The yield curve has 'uninverted'. That typically spells that the recession is here and investors and Warren are moving to the sidelines as investors are assuming the Fed will cut interest rates. We are entering a period in the markets where risk is now more pronounced. As investors we should, like Warren, proceed with caution.",2024-09-07
