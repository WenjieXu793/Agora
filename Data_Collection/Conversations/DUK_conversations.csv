"@ephud I'm pretty sure all scientists get paid or they'd starve. And by the way, you don't need capitalize ""Scientist"" or ""Science"". It doesn't add any credibility.So with you it's about money. That factors in huh. I'll say again, Exxon spent a fortune on scientists who gave them the wrong answer. And boy did they have financial incentive to give them the one they wanted.You do sort of seem to pick a side in that you say mainstream media and politicians offer nothing insightful. But they do. They present the public with the science. They don't just make stuff up. Well maybe Fox....",2024-10-05
"@Ivybanks ""What I said is that I'm with the 80-90% consensus of human causation""That's a consensus (opinion) amongst those who's paycheck is tied to funding. As I said, 80-90% agree that they need to keep getting paid. I gave you a link to the organization that circulated the petition. In there you will find the name and credentials of the signatories. To be clear, I do not pick a side here. I don't know who's right because I'm no expert. I just point out that one side, the side who's paycheck is at stake, insists the Science is settled. The other side, the ones who aren't paid to claim one way or the other, show that's just not the case. When one side, with financial incentive, is clearly being dishonest, how can you trust anything they say?Once again: clintel.org/...",2024-10-05
"@Ivybanks clintel.org/...The ""climate change industry"" is the group of organizations with an agenda based on a belief system rather than Science, that rely on grant money to continue their work. If they were to back off on the hysteria then the gravy train might just slow down and their paychecks might stop. Of course among them, the consensus is that the paychecks need to continue, so who is going to disagree when the wife needs a new beemer, the children need braces and the mortgage is due? Fortunately they make up only a small sliver of the Scientific community. Climate scientists rely on all aspects of Science to do their work and there are experts in those fields who do not agree with their hypothesis and are not on their payroll. How do you deal with those party poopers? You simply claim they aren't credible, with ""credible"" defined as only someone who agrees with the climate change agenda. This becomes hard when they have Nobel Prizes, Professorships at Universities all over the world and many PhDs etc who disagree. So to keep the gravy train running at full speed, you simply deny their existence and count on the mainstream media and left wing politicians to cover your back. You also rely on the gullibility of the general population to believe what they're told without thinking for themselves. I'm sure they are grateful for your participation.",2024-10-05
"By 2035 you'll see the DUK plant declared obsolete again and shuttered.For now sounds like a ploy to demonstrate additional generation is possible for data center field reps to site future developments.Once they commit to construct they are probably gonna stay and build out unless it's FoxConn. They have under performed in Harrisburg Pennsylvania and Pleasant Prairie Wisconsin on large plants in the past.As the data center deluge ages in this country more projects will come under strain and regulators and politicans will pay dearly for hasty approvals.The first to fail will create an Enron like response from the utility world and govt gad flies alike.In the end, as usual, the hapless rate payers will bear the brunt of all the Capex needed to build generation plants to serve these data centers.",2024-10-04
"@User 7682211 I'm pretty well read as to pellets. Was short EVA most of the way down, down, down. And I agree. There is no dispute that wood spews co2. And you'll see 500 scientists disputing the carbon neutral claim and another 500 supporting it. So one reads and reaches a conclusion based on the information.What seemed reasonable to me was that even if newly grown trees did eventually resequester todays pellet burning under the best case scenario,it would take 30-40 years which we don't have. Of course there can be no dispute that the process, the logging, pelletizing, shipping overseas is carbon intensive and not neutral. Those countries solve that by saying that portion must be accounted for at it's origin. So US & Canadian forests and mills and suppose shipping based on boundaries.Trees are the next big money grab as to inflation reduction act, carbon credits, etc. There are forest trusts that are getting paid in credits not to harvest trees. Or to delay harvest. Ikea's bought up land in the US and will profit from managing it, little harvest here, little there and carbon credits for the rest.",2024-10-04
"@Ivybanks ""And the same could be said of those scientists dismissing it being funded by much deeper pockets""Yes, it could be said and often is. I just can't find any evidence to show all those Scientists who signed the petition get any money at all from ""deeper pockets"". Perhaps you can share it with us as you seem to believe it? You don't believe things just because you're told do you?",2024-10-04
@ephud And the same could be said of those scientists dismissing it being funded by much deeper pockets.,2024-10-04
"Sell and pay capital gains tax, or just keep collecting the tax-advantaged dividends?    I am continuing to hold, and wlll likely add if the price comes down.  Electric utilities are good long-term holds if you believe that AI DataCenters will continue to be built and continue to need a lot of juice.",2024-10-04
"@dlhatheway Asheville was built up in a 100 yr flood plain.  Most ignored flood insurance.  Then the 100 year event happened again.DJT will help fix your confirmation bias of climate change.  IPCC is a fraud UN entity with fraudulent models.  Pay enough grant money to climate researchers and they will find payola consensus. This is not science but political science by the WEF, EU, and US progressives",2024-10-04
"@zyman It should be noted that ""climate scientists"" who are pushing the ""climate change"" narrative are all on the climate change industry payroll. Of course 98% agree that they want to continue getting a paycheck.",2024-10-04
@mdpath Then you should follow other authors. There are plenty which will regurgitate the same facts whether the stock is trading at 10X or 50X multiples.,2024-10-04
And reality sets in! Massive waste of resources and efforts. The next topical storm that fails to reach a category 2 level will mean climate goals reached - correct!,2024-10-04
"Selling a stock like DUK given its location and quality because it’s overvalued is, quite simply, ridiculous.",2024-10-04
"@qwerty11 ""Yes, but nowadays nobody just burns gas in a boiler anymore. You just put down a CCGT (for only a bit more than $0.5m/MW CAPEX)...""Just for peaking needs, you could maybe get away with a cheaper gas turbine.",2024-10-03

"@Trapping Value but the A doesn’t have qualified dividend status either from what I can see.  They both look like interchangeable preferreds.  I will have to investigate further, thanks.",2024-10-03
"Good evening Trapping, is there anything wrong with the Preferred B ?  It is close to par with an annual 1.41 Div.  Thanks.",2024-10-03
"@Big Fat Dummy I'd assume that conversion is costly. In the EU, UK and Japan they are swapping coal for wood pellets that are subsidized. And they get to claim wood pellets are carbon neutral even though they emit much more co2 to produce the same energy as coal. The theory is that newly planted trees will absorb that co2 25+ years out. I's suppose Duke isn't willing to pay the cost vs. coal without subsidies and to my knowledge the US isn't offering them.Read about Drax Power Station in UK. They've converted to pellets from coal with billions in subsidies over past 7-8 years. All that money rolls in and they repurchase shares, increase dividends and claim plant is carbon neutral. All on the taxpayers dime.",2024-10-03
Are these plants being converted to natural gas to plants? It would seem natural gas would be both a cost effective replacement and objectively be better for the environment. Would repurposing a coal-fired plant require that much time and resources?,2024-10-03
