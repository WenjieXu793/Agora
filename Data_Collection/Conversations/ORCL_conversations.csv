@slow_trader The price action on ORCL has been unpredictable.  I have been using long dated calls and/or call spreads with some success...this strategy requires active trading rather than holding.  The stock seems to have momentum right now.,2024-10-01
@medphysik I use options to limit my exposure but participate in the upside on ORCL.  I just hold the stock on GOOGL.  Then trim and add as the market rotates. But you should figure out what works for your own risk appetite.,2024-10-01
Market desperately wants choice. AMD brings that. Expect a more evenly split market in a year or two.,2024-09-27
"@RockyCT The FCF gives me more confidence. I still see the ratio of debt as a bit discomforting. Nevertheless, I want to buy Oracle, just at a lower price. I’m aware that I may not get that opportunity.",2024-09-26
"AMD Instinct MI300X Accelerators Available on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for Demanding AI ApplicationsNews— Customers including Fireworks AI are powering their AI inference and training workloads with new OCI Compute instances --— OCI Supercluster leads among cloud providers with support for up to 16,384 AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs in a single ultrafast network fabric --SANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) today announced that Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) has chosen AMD Instinct MI300X accelerators with ROCm open software to power its newest OCI Compute Supercluster instance called BM.GPU.MI300X.8. For AI models that can comprise hundreds of billions of parameters, the OCI Supercluster with AMD MI300X supports up to 16,384 GPUs in a single cluster by harnessing the same ultrafast network fabric technology used by other accelerators on OCI. Designed to run demanding AI workloads including large language model (LLM) inference and training that requires high throughput with leading memory capacity and bandwidth, these OCI bare metal instances have already been adopted by companies including Fireworks AI.ir.amd.com/...",2024-09-26
"I like that companies have diversified to OCI as 3rd choice with AWS and Azure for cloud.  The AI will continue to be a new stream for ORCL.  Like Amazon and MSFT, they need to keep finding new areas to grow the business.  Technology doesn't stand still for anyone.  I am targeting $210 Long ORCL.",2024-09-25
"ORCL has made a key pivot, enabling majors customers to run large Oracle databases in Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and AWS. This new “run anywhere” strategy and database cloud migration process has not yet been appreciated by most investors, and should have LT boost to ORCL stock price.Bottom Line:  Stay long.",2024-09-25
"@Explosive Growth Why is that debt a concern if they are an essential AI stock now.  And, are generating $10+ billion in free cash flow currently?",2024-09-25
"Great coverage. Oracle is now recognized as an essential AI stock to hold for years, but all that debt is a concern, you’re right. Waiting for a better entry.",2024-09-25
@Sage Capital NVDA is the better name here but ORCL should be a good one for 2025,2024-09-24
"@kalu0003 from a fundamental perspective, stocks are trading based on future expectations. In theory, existing news or growth catalysts should no longer or significantly impact stock prices. The market tends to buy into future expectations, anticipating that those expectations will eventually be realized. While hot stocks like NVDA may be great companies now, they might not be good long-term investments if much of the good news is already priced in, unless new catalysts emerge, like gaining more market shares, to push the stock higher in the future. Another key point is valuation multiples. Though they may be less relevant in the short term, as momentum can drive valuation expensive for a very long time, I believe valuation becomes more important for long-term investments.ORCL's current revenue growth remains in the single digits, but it is expected to accelerate in the future due to its strong backlog growth and continued capital investments in AI, which will eventually translate into robust FCF growth over the long term. However, this potential may already be partially priced in by the market.",2024-09-22
"Why would one invest in ORCL when there is NVDA, AVGO, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, META?  Help me understand this regarding ORCL.  Thanks for educating me on this. I am on a learning curve.",2024-09-22
Thanks for a very detailed analysis. I just purchased shares again after selling out about six months ago. Hopefully this time they don’t disappoint in their earnings and guidance like they did the two previous quarters!The positive forecasts should move them higher.,2024-09-22

"What ""Big equity gains"" ???    Many  US stock indices entered bear market territories in 2022.  Since that time to the end of August 2024,  VTI's annualized gain is +6.9%.  A 60/40 portfolio slightly less at +3.4% annualized.www.portfoliovisualizer.com/...It's true that there has been a big recovery in stock prices ""the last two years"" but a stock investor had to first climb out of the canyon before he/she  started earning positive returns again. Maybe he's referring to someone who got out of stocks early in 2022 and had a lot of dry powder?  Then bought back in near the low?   OK, then they might be able to talk about ""big"" equity gains.",2024-09-17
@Noah's Arc Capital Management Safra Catz did state on the conference call that the next 10 years should be fun.,2024-09-17
@Digby56 Why don't you dollar cost average into it and take the guessing out of it.  I bought some 2027 LEAPs today at current pricing.  Why do you think the stock will go down 10% to the 145-150 level.  They are about to become one of the most loved stocks on Wall Street.,2024-09-17
@Digby56 I like the stock for the really really long run so I'm less concerned about a short term 10% movement,2024-09-17
"@Noah's Arc Capital Management what would you peg as a reasonable entry point? Definitely not 165, but maybe 145 - 150?",2024-09-17
@Charles St not necessarily- many on this site have been preparing for two years and missed out on big equity gains,2024-09-17
