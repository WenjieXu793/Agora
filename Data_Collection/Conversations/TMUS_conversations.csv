"@nkvbradenton Closed out my short calls.  Having collected about 60% of the premium, the risk/reward was no longer there over the next two weeks.",2024-10-03
fwiw...i added to TMUS as the tmus/spy pair seems to breaking out of multiweek trading range.. the pair has gone from near 1 sigma cheap (3yr horizon) building a base from june 2023 to may 2024 to its current level of near 1 sigma rich.. on absolute basis no visible resistance as its trading at all time high,2024-10-03
good article.. i added to TMUS as the tmus/spy  pair seems to breaking out of multiweek trading range.. the pair has gone from near 1 sigma cheap (3yr horizon) building a base from june 2023 to may 2024 to its current level of near 1 sigma rich.. on absolute basis no visible resistance as its trading at all time high,2024-10-03
"@OlafDanielson I understand your stance. Trading on the margin generally tends to work out quite well, what with all the noise and fluctuations that is the norm weekly. As far as V's go, I have sold about two thirds just before the recent X-date as part of some portfolio moves. At around 8%, I felt near term price upside was limited. I have kept what I had in couple tax advantaged accounts where I am happy parking these sort of yield securities. Sector is still seeing consolidation and deal activities (Verizon in the news lately twice) and T getting out of their colossal mistake. Time for some news here. Hope the management ends up with a deal on spectrum in the next few months.",2024-10-02
"@nkvbradenton do not disagree  i let some of ours get called away, but that happens .....will buy back if trends down a little, we'll see....bought some uze with proceeds  still not sure what to do with our Vs",2024-10-02
"@KenVa I have thought about it multiple times and it makes sense to get some income while we await some sort of announcement. However, having amassed what I consider a double, if not triple, position so diligently, I have elected to roll the dice and face come what may, my way. Odds of success high, timing uncertain. We will see how luck plays in this foray.",2024-09-30
That TMo did not already have a CISO is corporate malfeasance and negligence of the first order in 2024.   (And not having employees using MFA is just as bad.),2024-09-30
so not even $0.50 per user? I mean SS# are for cheap in that case .... TMOBILE should NEVER Ever be trusted with PII information - EVER - US Govt needs to learn from the mistakes of decades of leak,2024-09-30
"@jzwmnb01   Covered call sales made last week look good today. Since that could change with one PR, I only sold a few.",2024-09-30
@OlafDanielson Only about 2% of shares are short.  September short interest is down in September to about 2.42 million shares from 2.98 million shares in August.  September info as of 9/13.,2024-09-28
"@nkvbradenton like a guy heavily short, you'd buy a call above your short position in case it blew up, so the guy could be bearish that the whole deal would go sour and stock drop into the teens but wasn't quite sure, if sure you would not buy insurance",2024-09-28
"@OlafDanielson One never can tell for sure. Fund managers at times also engage in mega options plays, depending on strategic direction they are playing the underlying issue. What is interesting here with TDS lately, there have been multiple blocks of call options traded, literally thousands of contacts. This, while the options are not heavily traded normally. Funky dynamics.We are less than a dollar away from another fifty two week high price point.",2024-09-27
"@jzwmnb01 While it is a worthwhile and profit generating endeavor on a stock trading in a channel, it is risky strategy in an event driven stock like TDS. Of course, if one is looking at a defined exit point on a position, CC works like a charm. I just maintain that one of these days news might hit us which takes us higher by several dollars. Odds of that happening are not de minimus.",2024-09-27
"@The Masked Superstar I can be patient as long as the share price stays somewhat constant or keeps melting higher.   I was a seller of cc's but after several profitable cycles, I decided to stay long (almost as I still write a csp's from time to time.)  Best of luck!",2024-09-27
@nkvbradenton Early August 2023. Spectrum Deal with ATT for $2-$3B would send this straight to $35/$40,2024-09-27
"@KenVa We won't know for sure. Chalk it up to all the news flow and some one playing the probabilities but with serious money behind the bet. Grand slam if it works. I doubt it is a hedge against a short. We are still waiting and Nov expiration is two months away. Come to think, we are approaching one year anniversary when the strategic alternative announcement was made. Time consuming process and that is why patience is paramount.",2024-09-27
@nkvbradenton Hmmm... so what info did that buyer of 4K option contracts have?  Looks reliable at the moment.,2024-09-27
@Valuestocks007 DISCLOSURE: I'm an amateur investor. Everyone on SA has more knowledge and expertise than me.,2024-09-26
@Valuestocks007 1) The dividend. 2) I'm in at $33.XX. 3) Poor management at T. 4) TMUS's time may be coming.,2024-09-26
