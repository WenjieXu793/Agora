@Dividend Grower But in the case of CNTHP what would be the reason for paying above the call price when there are loads of other traded preferred like the ones mentioned above? I just can't wrap my mind around the attraction to CNTHP preferred shares because of the pricing disparity for comparable preferred alternatives.,2024-09-27
"@Matthew Utesch Hi Matthew, thinly traded is part of the issue, however a lot of utility preferred stocks have gone up just as utilities have the last couple months. Lots of yield seeking before and after the Fed rate cut.  Spire's preferred shares have gone from $23.36 in June to just under their $25.00 call price.  I'm not surprised to see share prices above calls in some cases, depending on how high the yield is.  It will also depend on how far the Fed cuts rates.",2024-09-26
"Really appreciate the article. I am looking on quantumonline.com and checking on the preferred shares of CNTHP. I can't quite figure out why someone would look at these shares because the call amount is less than the current share price which would represent a higher degree of risk to the investor (yes, I understand these issues have been around for quite some time).Is there am something I am missing? Why wouldn't someone look at AILIH, NSARP, UEPEN, WELPP? Does the discrepancy have to do with how thinly traded these preferreds are and how there is almost no volume to go off of?Thanks in advance!",2024-09-26
"Good article. I'm not sure that IL and MO's lack of population growth is such a bad thing. Constantly having to build out new infrastructure to keep up with increasing populations is costly. And utility regulators don't want residential electric bills to rise.  Tobacco companies haven't grown for a long time. But they still make a profit and pay out dividends. AEE might be thought of as a bond proxy. It won't change much, and you invest for the dividends.",2024-09-12
