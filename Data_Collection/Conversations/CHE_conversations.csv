"I view CHE as the poster child for a non-correlated risk no matter if the economy is falling or rising.  Certainly the phase of PE contraction/expansion in the stock market will impact all equities however.  So with both of these themes at top of mind, what is my next step on CHE?  My portfolio weighting is already too great given the many years I've held ever since they traded down to $35 after a hatchet job of a fallacious short and distort report by Citron many years ago (hopefully a risk factor not to be repeated).But I can't ignore where CHE is trading today and don't want to see the Fed cuts lift all boats later this month and thru Q4 and taking CHE higher with it.I am very cautious to not provide too much investment advice to my family members who are not stock savvy, but CHE is in a great spot for adds to portfolios with a very long ""hold and forget"" mode as death and clogged drains are not going out of style any time soon (non-correlated), and the operations of this company are handled quite well historically.My only concern is the top management in Cincinnati are not the sharpest tools in the shed...as long as they are happy to just do their insider sells and not get fancy with acquisitions (which history says they suck at) ... this is a perfect stock for the widows and grand-kids portfolios.  Is this the right time to make buy call on CHE or am I just feeling a little FOMO?",2024-09-05
"Always glad to see an analyst pick up this tricky name for an update.I've been a holder for well over a decade and that is the type of time frame that is appropriate for CHE.  I'll offer a few insights (and for full disclosure, I was CFO taking another hospice company public and we offered great quality service and great run until Medicare CAP reared its ugly head...a risk factor all need to consider with Vitas.) .For today I'll highlight this comment made in the analysts intro...""runway to redeploy surplus funds"".  Yes Vitas is a cash cow, few cap exp requirements and decent consistent operating margins.  Over the last several years, the FCF has been ""exclusively"" dedicated to share buybacks, not to increase the dividend.  So PE looks higher if not taking the expected share shrinkage into account in modeling EPS.More importantly, let's hope that management continues to realize that buying CHE is a much more accretive transaction than buying other hospices...their last two deal  having been disasters that ended up with Medicare CAP problems.",2024-08-29
This company checks a lot of boxes so doing some work on this. Why is Roto Rooter contracting? How cyclical is this busi ess? Will construction and lower j terest rates help growth?How have Medicare reimbursements trends been playing out in recent years? Does the lower cap ex and higher SBC artificially increase FCF and affect your valuations? EV to FCF is well over 30 times and it looks like Roto is struggling and SBC and lower Capex are phasing up FCF....well low growth and highly profitable companies...why shouldn't the valuation be more appropriate at 25 times which would put fair value closer to $500?,2024-08-25
