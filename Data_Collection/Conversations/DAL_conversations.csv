@Bill the Bag Man agree.  At a macro level the weekly summary that would be somewhat useful would be the number of companies that reported positive earnings growth or revenue growth net inflation.  Of which I think only CCL did.  Would need to check.  But otherwise not a very helpful metric.,2024-10-05
Do companies ever really guide earnings very high? No. They guide on the conservative cautious side. Usually that is why an equity tanks if they miss or guide lower. Nothing earth shattering and it is not saying much about the macro economic picture.,2024-10-05
"@Aprendiendo All the planes I have been on in Q3 have been full to the point that it is unlikely that, in hub routes, that high status flyers got many complementary upgrades.  In Q3, customers buying first and business class tickets have eased out many ""free"" upgrades.",2024-10-03
Any change in your opinion this days? It looks market sentiment around Delta is being negative. We are very close to the earnings call...,2024-10-03
@Alex_13 I agree. Market sentiment is running behind the actual fundamentals in my opinion,2024-09-23
"Interesting, thanks. DAL is on my radar because the USA cef I hold established it as a new position in August. Seems like they share your view that the recent low was an opportunity.",2024-09-23
@Noah's Arc Capital Management Ual is arguably even better PE and same tailwinds as dal. I hold both.,2024-09-23
@slow_trader Its a really solid name! I think the market is not talking enough about the tailwinds,2024-09-23
@Joseph Parrish De-leverage and Delta does not buy the planes to keep up with market and competitor growth.Are you sure that is what you want?,2024-09-21
You're going to see Delta reach $100. $20 is possible in the event of a nuclear war :),2024-09-20
"@markcc , all the more reason that they should be strengthening the balance sheet pronto (de-levering and building up cash).  DAL is an investment where it's very easy to manage one's risk poorly.",2024-09-20
"@Joseph Parrish Agreed.  In this case, Delta has pulled out of a number of small to midsize airports during COVID and not replaced the service. It also wants to expand in places like Miami, Austin and Boston.  In addition, with planes,  it can  grow in LAX while the window exists before United gets its new ""Terminal 9"" and Southwest gets its new ""Concourse 0"" and American finishes the rebuilds of its terminals, all adding gates to Delta's competitors.Right now, load factors are in the mid 80-90% range.  Overcapacity would  be a large enough drop to erase margins, which does not appear to be happening.  Meantime, even with delivery cutbacks, the low cost airlines are growing faster and will be taking share from Delta.  It will be harder for Delta to grow revenue once losing market share.",2024-09-20
"@Tomassino V. Walker , so I think you considered a lot of good points.  When I do an analysis, I consider such things as well.  There's a risk I will leave something out for readers.  There's also a risk I will over-complicate a thesis for them.  Considering the value of the DCF with more de-levering or more refinancing is one such subtlety.I think the fact that you are correctly raising these questions speaks to the multiple ways the future timeline can split for Delta, in a way that is true for them and other airlines and not for your average company.  An airline is a peculiar business, both very necessary and very fragile to outside forces.As you pointed out, a terminal multiple usually accounts for most of the value of a business, as it's a short hand of all future cash flows past the period covered (in my case, a decade).  A conservative valuation of NVDA, for example, would probably put a majority of the value in the distant future because of how much it can grow.A decade ago, DAL's market cap was $32B.  Since then, it generated only $13B in cash and gained over $20B in debt.  If we're looking at an investment thesis that would have made sense for DAL, heavy risk management would have been part of it, and so I figured that's where I should aim my own thesis.",2024-09-20
"@markcc , you raise some good points there, and then there's the issue of whether adding planes creates over-capacity, which is different kind of bite in the ass for them.  The basic point you highlight: Growing revenue is tough for an airline.",2024-09-20
"I generally agree with the move in Delta as I got into options in a big way before the current run-up. However, going forward, the undertow issues for Delta are still massive. Your comment that ""Growth will largely depend on maximizing revenue from premium products and giving those customers a quality experience."" does not consider the relatively small order rate of planes, as compared to United,  for the rest of the decade vs. the planes reaching retirement age.  Delta cannot materially take its high RASM and CASM and turn it into profits without increasing the rate of new planes added vs,. competition.  Loss of market share, while being profitable, is a poor strategy.",2024-09-20
"you hooked me with a $20 recommended entry price when it closed over $47 yesterday. The seasonal changes within this year's DAL stock price during the past year have offered $10 to $12 share gains periodically twice this year (thanks to this week!).  your write up emphasizes risk relating to timing/payback due to the significant reliance on borrowings to fund the business but yet it seems your DCF analysis reflects a cash flow to equity computation.  Id be interested in seeing results of cash flow to invested capital with a WACC that reflects a blended return from the debt and equity (with your assumptions) and the value of the current debt load subtracted from the initial indication.   since you point out management may opt to delver the balance sheet rather than return it to equity owners, the wait and see elements would be better captured within a WACC analysis.you also disadvantage DAL in your math for the terminal multiple.  the 10% discount rate for FCF implies a 10x multiple in the discrete period yet your terminal value is only 5 times or a 20% return. in estimating current fair market value, why would the business exit at such a discount?  I would expect to see a much closer correlation, one that assume a better multiple earned upon liquidation than what has been achieved awaiting the horizon event.  the terminal value usually represent the lion's share of the value conclusion in a DCF analysis, that is not the case here and what seems to make up the major differential between your suggested conclusion and the current price.  your analysis alludes to a valuation that would take place during the ""troubled times occurring near the end of the decade"".  you might emphasize that at the beginning of the article if that is what you intend for us to do in acting upon your recommendation, e.g. buy the stock once its positioned to recover from the next 911, COVID, etc. type event.  I appreciate your article and the opportunity to provide feedback.",2024-09-20

"What about Copa airlines?  Symbol is CPA.  Excellent profits, supper low p/e, great yield and somewhat dominant positioin in the central S. American market",2024-09-14
"@Stone Fox Capital thank you. Well said.DAL has outperformed market indices at times including last fall.It is incredible that anyone would say you can't invest in a sector and then spends an enormous amount of bandwidth trying to defend their decision when it is clear that investors have and can make money investing in airline stocks.DAL earlier today affirmed its guidance for the year despite the CRWD issues, says corporate travel is stronger than it has been in 5 years, and Delta leads the industry YTD in operational reliability despite the CRWD meltdown.your thesis, SFC, was right.",2024-09-12
"@markcc You can always play those games with plenty of stocks. At some point, airlines will produce fantastic returns. $DAL should already trade at $77 with a $6.50 EPS target for this year.",2024-09-12
