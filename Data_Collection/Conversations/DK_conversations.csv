"@BakkenTheSaddle If DKL is unable to service its debts when they come due, what do you think would happen?  DK would need to backstop it.",2024-09-11
"@Dukebailey They have to do business with each other, I agree. Not the same as saying that DKL's debt is the same thing as DK's debt, which is how it looks on casual inspection of the balance sheet.",2024-09-11
"@BakkenTheSaddle That’s like a human saying “my heart will be fine if my arteries become clogged”.DKL and DK are heavily dependent on each other, and are like Siamese twins that cannot be separated.",2024-09-10
Debt mostly belongs to DKL and is non recourse to the assets of DK. Just consolidated on the balance sheet because of DK's high ownership of DKL.Generally the time to buy refiners is at cycle bottoms when recent earnings are negative. Hopefully DK understands this with their buyback plan.,2024-09-09
"@mlvalue Thanks for your comment. Tough spot to be in right now, and the market seems to be punishing its peers even harder today alone. There could be a bottom coming soon, but I don't like trying to catch falling knives; hence the red flag warning to new investors kicking the tires. Yes, lots of cash is allocated right now for buybacks, around $560 million, but stack that against long-term debt, which stands at approximately $2.5 billion... it's not pretty. I hope I'm wrong, and my 'sell' call is a contrarian signal for share price.",2024-09-09
"It would be foolish to sell here at 18.  The new contracts with DKL will save them quite a bit of money in costs.  They are flush with cash, over $1 billion.  The refinery margins are difficult in the current cycle, but it will get better.  They could do a pretty sizable buyback.  It’s closer to a buy now, not a sell.",2024-09-09
"Addendum: To get more insights on DKL and ""Sum Of The Parts"", I recommend reading SA Analyst's Michael Boyd's previous take ""Delek US Holdings: Why Sum Of The Parts Seems Like A Mistake"" which, in a nutshell explained in June that as a DK shareholder, the potential for a big payoff—possibly a $48 share price, which would mean doubling the value. This comes from the combined worth of Delek’s stake in Delek Logistics (DKL), retail, and refining operations. But here’s the catch Boyd pointed out: it’s tough to unlock that value because selling or spinning off Delek Logistics is tricky since it’s closely tied to Delek’s refineries and management hadn't cracked the code on this, but at least shareholders were still seeing benefits from Delek Logistics’ cash flow and share buybacks, even if the full potential hadn't been tapped.",2024-09-09
