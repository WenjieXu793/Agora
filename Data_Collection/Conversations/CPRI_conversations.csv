"@Logan Kane they want to close, especially tapestry. Earning call reaffirmed they want the merger to happen and are committed to the $57 price. In the long run it's worth the current premium. The real question is how well can tapestry execute their growth and synergy between the brands. For sure they will have more power when it comes to lease negotiation",2024-10-08 11:51:29.922635
"(b)    Termination Fee.(i)    If (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(g), or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), (B) prior to the date of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company Board of Directors, the Company’s management or the Company Shareholder or otherwise becomes publicly known, or any Person publicly proposes or announces an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal, and (C) within twelve (12) months of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal is consummated or a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal is entered into (and such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated), then on or prior to the date any such Acquisition Proposal is consummated, the Company shall, by way of compensation, pay to Parent a fee of $240,000,000 in cash (the “Termination Fee”). Solely for purposes of this Section 8.2(b)(i), the term “Acquisition Proposal” shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Annex A, except that all references to “twenty” percent (20%)” and “eighty percent (80%)” therein shall be deemed to be references to “fifty percent (50%).”(ii)    If (x) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), within two (2) Business Days after such termination, the Company shall, by way of compensation, pay to Parent the Termination Fee.(iii)    If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h), the Company shall, by way of compensation, pay to Parent the Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with and as a condition of its termination pursuant to Section 8.1(h).(iv)    In the event any amount is payable by the Company pursuant to the preceding clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), such amount shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.

@BrutalHonesty bad.  Mid-$20s?  Low $20s without a plan / high $20s with a self-help strategy to turnaround brands the way that this deal would.,2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
@Logan Kane I don't see in the docs where Tapestry can get out of the deal with a breakup fee...,2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
@Simon Dadouche I don't believe Tapestry can pay a fee to terminate the deal.,2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
"Saw this on X - x.com/... The judge asked what the parameters are for demarcation and the ftc lawyer said, “The lines don’t have to be drawn with the precision of a NASA scientist.” That seems to be what sent $cpri higher on the day. FTC didn’t provide a strong response that the judge was looking for and speculation is in favor of the merger proceeding. We shall see.",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
@tedbaze absolutely it was a great deal in the low 30s,2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
Not sure why people were afraid of this lawsuit. 0 merit and a waste of resources.,2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000

"The FTC seems to not want to allow businesses to succeed.  ""43% of S&P 500 market cap now under FTC/DoJ antitrust investigation: BofA"" - x.com/...A judge could grant a preliminary injunction, but I still think the FTC losses in the end. Here's a good article on the trial - lawreview.law.miami.edu/...There few people following on X that are more timely than SA - not necessarily $CPRI related, but they seem to have covered aspects of it:@mergerpie @johnmarknewman Searching on $CPRI on X shows a few opinions too as well as recent news stories, like this from bloomberg:www.bloomberg.com/...",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@Klarminite True, but they still make compelling points. This whole trial seems ridiculous. They should make a movie about it called, ""An attempt to end capitalism"".The FTC seems to want to use narrow metrics to showcase monopolistic behavior and got called out. Hopefully the judge sees through it. If I understand it correctly, the FTC took a marketing term from a spreadsheet to define a novel definition of a market space and didn't even call the person who invented the term to testify?  They didn't consider the totality of sales channels but cherry pick numbers from department stores to reinforce their argument? There's tons of competition in this space, but more importantly, this could set precedence to inhibit the ability of other companies to flourish without M&A. just my $0.02.",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000

"@DJH15 @KSKSKS -- I see what you mean, my mistake. Misread the wording on discount vs. upside.. not sure why we would care more about the discount over the spread.",2024-09-17 00:00:00.000000
@bluescorpion0 Have you never followed commercial litigation?Every case relies on expert witnesses.,2024-09-17 00:00:00.000000
@Chris Besserer you weren’t paying attention in math class. The SA author WAS CORRECT…Capri is selling at a 30% discount from the price of 57. If the stock goes up from its current price of $40. that would be a 42% gain.,2024-09-17 00:00:00.000000
"@Klarminite So the FTC can reflect on why they made such a poor decision to pursue a useless case?  Maybe it's just me, but here is +100K reasons why this should be thrown right out the window.  www.alibaba.com/...",2024-09-17 00:00:00.000000
Shares are at a 42% discount to $57 at todays price. (Not 30% as article states),2024-09-17 00:00:00.000000
Why is there such a big time lag between last day in court (17.Sept) and closing arguments (30. Sept)?,2024-09-17 00:00:00.000000
"""Tapestry's main brands are Coach and Kate Spade, while Capri owns Michael Kors, Versace, and Jimmy Choo""What is the difference between all the brands. What do they hope to achieve buying these brands? Are they looking for cost synergies? Why do people buy these brands if they can buy non-name brand bags made by the same manufacturer and may be of the same quality at much lower price? Are there many other well-known brands in the same price category?I think the company will take away the choices and the substitution options for consumers that like to buy only certain brands, even if there are other choices. My guess is over time they will raise the prices of all the brands, or some of the brands and bifurcate the market into two price points. And clearly this means they are trying to reduce competition.",2024-09-14 00:00:00.000000
