"Equitable is a ponzi scheme that will evaporate in a major market meltdown.  While it is true that they use derivatives to protect against downside, they basically sell annuities that promise a guanteed return based on certain market factors.  If they correctly use hedging, it offsets any potential loss.But the fact that they are not gathering new assets, only increasing assets from a rise in the market tells the whole story.  This company preys on suckers who are financially unsophisticated and it pays its sales force hefty commissions for generating those clients. In a market downturn, there will be a combination of retreating clients and falling valuations.  In particular, the worst case for a company of this type is when both bonds and equities fall, which is a  distinct possibility in a stagflationary environment.The dividend will be cut to zero and customer non-renewals will lead to a general default when the big market crash finally hits.",2024-09-20
