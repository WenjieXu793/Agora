It's time to cut this dividend to ZERO and reinvest the additional free cashflow into more resorts; preferably a strategic acquisition that's trading at less than a 23 P/E ratio....,2024-10-08 11:29:37.962521
@D.T.A.A 14 Board members that collectively own (1% of the company). Over half of this is held by the former CEO.i.e thirteen remaining board members own .5%~ of the company,2024-10-08 11:29:37.962521

@5ofDiamonds I believe you are invested in $MTN correct ? :),2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
@gdogd They have a presence in Andermatt and Crans-Montana in Switzerland. I pay 100 chf for a day pass in Switzerland and the season pass is around 1750 chf in Zermatt. Never skied in the US though ...,2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000
"Yes, this normalization process may be an excuse for poor management: I have skied my whole life and MTN has become like Marvell. Something that use to be fun, and unique has become homework and redundant. As with other companies (eg nke sbux etc) that have jacked up prices and lost novelty, their stocks have been slaughtered in the biggest bull marker on record (those companies have recently fired their ceos). Given the size of their pay packages that should be grounds for firing the CEO and the whole board of MTN as well. Everyone loves getting rich but when greed crosses a line everything suffers. Companies that kept their prices low and offered fun have sky rocketed. They should hire a few old school ski bums, outsource the mtns to the mom and pops they bought them from, to bring back the vibe and freedom.  Chunk the cookie cutter bushiness plans and obsession with status. Creativity, inclusiveness and that freedom vibe that we all ski for is what MTN needs. No one fun that does things spur of the moment is going to spend 250$ to go skiing on a pow pow day or just bc they can't take work anymore. Everything has to be planned with a ""season pass"" that cost 1000$s. It was borderline expensive at 40$ years ago who are they kidding at 250$ plus/day and Michelin star like prices for Hormel chili (250 is what I payed for a season pass). I only do back country with my nalgene bottle and trail mix now bc of this incompetence in the states; and then go to  austria and switzerland where you can get immersed in a beautiful world at only 20 euros for a couple of hours of skiing and real food. Why would anyone ski the US anymore? Lets hope the EU keeps these guys out.  Fire the whole lot and or break up this garbage oligopoly. Where is KHAN when we need her.",2024-10-04 00:00:00.000000

"@New Adams I think the market doesn't like the financial results. You can have trouble attracting front line workers while being too bloated in corporate. So that isn't necessarily inconsistent. However, the author seems to gloss over the fact that Vail has been nothing but a stream of disappointing earnings for several years now, offers no financial predictions or offer a compelling argument why they are about to turn the corner.",2024-09-27 00:00:00.000000
"@New Adams fair enough, and yet nothing about their recent performance instills any confidence that management has a good handle on things. Reports of operational missteps at their resorts continue, and their financial performance has been one disappointment after another. I think it's getting close to time where the Vail C-suite gets purged and new management comes in to turn around the company.",2024-09-27 00:00:00.000000

At what point does Vail need a change in leadership? Too many earnings disappointments and operational challenges the last three years.,2024-09-27 00:00:00.000000
@BDuerr12 That's an even better idea. Outsource equipment rental to a 3rd party who pays Vail for access to Vail's customers.,2024-09-21 00:00:00.000000
