"@Tubby60 I can't make sense of it either.I would not be a buyer of the 2025'sA play might be to go long the 2031's, and short the 2025's...",2024-10-03
"Officially 4 weeks out from Q3 earnings call and the '25 bonds are staying firm in the high $80's with some larger transaction sizes.  Conjecturing that this might imply that the institutional holders would agree to a 10%-12% discount in restructuring, that still leaves $400mm+ to cover.  I can't figure out even hypothetically what can go in OPI's kitchen sink to make the math work to resolve the '25's.",2024-10-03
"@bondsmoker imagine that...a Portnoy run company as a meme stock...a ""Porky Meme""",2024-10-02
I am really curious where are all the OPI investors who created all the negativity when DHC & OPI merger was first announced. Today DHC market cap is 8x the OPI market cap. Just a note for the records.,2024-09-30
"@Tack 49% YTM...sure, but YTR?  (Yield to Reorg).2025 bonds will result in a huge negative yield if reorg happens before their maturity.And it is really hard to see how they will pay off those 2025 bonds at maturity.",2024-09-23
"@andysif Short OPI & Long OPINL not a great strategy.OPINL tops out at $25.  There's no theoretical top to OPI.I doubt it will happen, but OPI could get caught in a meme rally.",2024-09-23
"@Tubby60 Yeah, last round of CRE crash was malls.  This time, its office.We are still in fairly early innings, due to historically low interest rates and multi-year leases.But as leases expire, and debt comes due...its getting ugly, and will likely get uglier.That said - for some reason, OPINL keeps outpacing the bonds.2031 bonds - 40% of parBaby bonds - 56% of par.That's a rather large variance.",2024-09-23
"Anyone have an example of a CRE REIT that's defaulted over the last several years?  I must be looking in the wrong places to research this ... I hold the '25's from back when they were IG rated, liquidated part of the position once the recent value bump got me to cash neutral (inclusive of interest pmts).  I'm holding the remaining half position and anticipating that OPI won't be able pull off the $499mm 2/25 payout.  I'm trying to gauge how quickly the pricing can fall with a CRE REIT when the inevitable starts to move the bigger holders to sell or the REIT proposes a haircut payout.  Thanks in advance for any kind assistance.",2024-09-18
"@Pacifica Yield   The baby bonds are unsecured senior debt, ranking equally with all other unsecured senior debt, so whatever asset-coverage ratios they may enjoy don't prevent them from being treated identically in any bankruptcy.  As the Feb 2025 note are now trading at a 49% YTM, they look like they may be a far better short-term option than the baby bonds, which have no upcoming maturity.  Granted, one gets a nice yield for a long time, but the downside risks appear identical to the regular bonds.",2024-09-09
