Nice article…DS Smith is their growth…also have to understand IP had to sell their successful Russian business due to Ukraine war…,2024-09-20
SUZ was never going to happen…it was a hostile takeover attempt by a smaller company in a less profitable pulp side of the paper business w/external financing (3G Capital).  SUZ would have been out of their ability zone with such a large acquisition (they were trying to grab IP on the cheap).DS Smith is still happening and IP will manage this integration successfully (as they’ve done so with other acquisitions in the past).  This was not mentioned and needs further analysis.We are also seeing the market shift from fixed income (Jerome to begin lowering rates) into value/dividend stock to grab those rates b4 they are lowered by higher stock price - as seen by the rise in DJIA/S&P vs NASDEQ lately.  Those that hid in fixed income are not looking for tech…they are looking for value/dividend.,2024-09-17
"As owner of IP stock, I much appreciate your thinking and this article. Wrote call option at Jan 25 for 45….might have to sell to close option then sell stock.",2024-09-17
