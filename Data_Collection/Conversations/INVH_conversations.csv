"How can dividends be simultaneous safe ""one of the healthiest and safest dividends I know of in this space"" and not-so-safe ""With this in mind, INVHâ€™s dividend appears Borderline Safe with a moderate risk of being cut."" ?",2024-10-08 10:49:36.566357
"@berwyn1 Yep, sounds like price gouging.  But that's capitalism unregulated and unrestrained.  The whole starter home with marriage is a trap anyway, so this generation should be thankful for their unanswered prayers.  :)Maybe there will be a paradigm shift in the future.  It's just better to own IVFH than your own home anyway.  IVFH pays and is no maintenance.  You still have the equity either way.  But IVFH can't be vandalized or prone to geographic risks like your own home.  Can't tie you down, no transaction fees on both the front and back end.  That in and ofitself is a price-gouging racket.  Maybe in the future you can buy a house on the blockchain without those hefty closing costs.  Perhaps even fractional shares.  Who knows what the future holds.  Maybe even mass housing like they do in China, building up. Communities with their own grocery store, etc.  Maybe these land dwelling units will become more valuable, or maybe people will start to view McMansions as a waste of money and space.  They just suck up money anyway.  Their appreciation is just inflation.  You aren't going to be able to monetize anything unless you downsize or move to a ""business friendly"" state or country, where the residents' homes are cheaper.  Californians being the smart ones there.  Their high maintenance and repair costs are never sutracted from the final sales price.  It's all an American myth anyway.  It's better to be a minimalist with minimal costs and let your money work for you, in places like IVFH, where currently you hold the American myth hostage.  The pendulum will swing back one day.  Perhaps a silver tsunami in conjunction with overbuilding and even a paradigm shift in attitudes -- who knows.  But swing back it will.  In 2008, nobody foresaw this ""crisis"" in 2024.   People are shortsighted anyway.Who knows.  I don't really care anymore. I just know I have a good slice of the American dream held hostage with some REITS like IVFH.  Not in the rat race, but the rats in the race all working for me.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
"I love my income portfolio I started here 1.5 years ago:i.postimg.cc/...Only two $15000 deposits made, and it's at $37,000.  The goal:  Drop $15,000 at its anniversary date each year as I march to $100,000 in order to fund all transportation needs.  Funded by annual dividend income alone while preserving capital.  It's primarily REIT focused.And INVH is in there.  I like having have around 3% of the housing shortage between INVH and AMH.  I could never decide which I liked better.  AMH has some reputational issues as well.  I just decided to do both.  Whoever is in red in that portfolio is who gets funded in the next $15000 drop.  Plus, dividends get reinvested only in the reds.  The flowers watering the weeds.Just one growth stock in there not paying a div. yet, and that's not a growth story yet but will be.  A contrarian's growth story.Between Camden Properties (Apartments), Invitation Homes, and American Homes, I have the shelter needs covered to my satisfaction.  That's the best way to be a landlord and property owner in my book. Most liquid way too with no transaction costs.",2024-10-01 00:00:00.000000
