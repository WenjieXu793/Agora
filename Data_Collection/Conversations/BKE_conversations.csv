"@SkiManJamie As a long time holder, I agree.  Two comments by management in today's Q2 call give me hope that improvements are occurring: (1) they recognize the issues with their website and internet presence and are working with consultants to improve there online marketing and (2) management is now expanding store counts with plans to add 5 new stores in the balance of the year.  There focus on their online capability started seeing improved sales in July continuing in August according to management.",2024-08-23
"It's a 3% dividend yield with a history of a special dividend in January which has ranged recently from $2/sh to $2.65/sh (depending on earnings during the year, ignoring the blowout earnings and special dividend of $5.65/sh in 2022). Including a 2.50/sh special dividend that would be a 9% yield.And although revenues have been trending down for 1.5 years, that's off levels that are significantly above pre-pandemic levels so the company's results have weathered the famed bull-whip effect pretty well. And they're stil sporting strong double digit operating margins, 17% in the past quarter or 20% on a TTM basis (4Q being a seasonally strong quarter). The stock is cheap at 10X earnings, strong double digit margins, and net cash of 6.69/share with a non-cash working capital surplus (cash is not offset by a massive WC deficit).  And while too early to indicate a trend, July sales were up. This is a well managed company that doesn't deserve to be valued like it's garbage.",2024-08-23
