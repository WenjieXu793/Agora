"@Orangejulius aapl is way over valued imho. Some of the suppliers aren’t. They usually get punished more.Mings comment is way too one sided and buyers might be a wait and see how the AI stuff will works. We don’t know as both sides do exist.Apples AI is the first spot on approach out there. The example that isn’t discussed much was this: Aunt is coming to visit. Siri by what name can set the whole trip to go get her at the airport oh on the way forgot to to head to the store Siri can change it in the fly remind you when to leave reroute for traffic get you to store and will even text Aint at the right and place to meet. This used only Apple standard appsExpand this. I want to eat out this week suggest a night based on a schedule suggest places set a reservation remind when to leave in that day. Guide through traffic and help with the menu. Etc  This requires outside apps This power will change out lifes forever. One example only. If this works I think it will , this is life changing.TBDMark",2024-09-19
"@Patient Tech Investor Thank you for being cordial. I keep encountering AAPL investors who angrily push back on any negative news. The only other stock I've seen this with is TSLA.I try my best to keep an open mind with any of these news stories, but this one isn't very actionable. Unless we see hard data confirming disappointing sales, it's just conjecture.My main concern is that the AI hype seeped into AAPL stock with everyone expecting a ""super cycle."" The truth will probably be more muted, and we're left with a stock still trading over 30x forward earnings. I personally view AAPL as overvalued, and don't directly own shares, just indirectly through index funds and BRK.B.",2024-09-19
@Orangejulius be careful with that idea The last analyst look at production believes that Apple manufactured 6 million more units of Pro models. Strangely Cirrus delivered 6 million new iPhone units in their June quarter something that they have never done before. New iPhone delivers always started in Sept quarter It appears that the Plus is flying off the table and the Pros are maybe slightly down but nothing major. He based his estimate on deliver times. He doesn’t know. He is guessing wo all the cards. Mark,2024-09-17
@Winnertakesall You can't even pre-order in Europe until Sept 20 dah!,2024-09-16
"@Orangejulius Well personally I just care about Micron - but interesting facts, thanks for the response.  For memory I was hoping the new iPhone would be a boost as it contains more DRAM, etc. However, there does seem to be some weak consumer data coming in.  Its exhausting being a Micron shareholder.",2024-09-16
"@Scott the Robot Analysts are apparently able to make a prediction based upon availability dates from the preorders. The ""Pro"" models in particular may have been overproduced and seem to have the shortest wait time. Real numbers won't be out for some time, and Apple no longer reports units sold, just total sales.Today's reaction is a crack in the bullish narrative that demand will be higher than last cycle. It appears that's not the case, if you go by this early data. It's not the most actionable data, but AAPL is at a very high multiple, so they need to deliver big beats.",2024-09-16
SWKS is an interesting case. It dropped when it was announced that they lost some IPhone supply contracts to other companies; now they fall again because there are concerns about the IPhone deliveries…,2024-09-16
Apple concerns are blown out of proportion and mistimed. Bears and fear mongering at it’s peak,2024-09-16
"I cannot believe anyone is taking Ming-Chi Kuo seriously on this one. His sources are in parts supply. He would only know about the number of parts that were purchased and supplied to create the phones many months ago. Apple  would not be purchasing the parts and manufacturing the phone now at this late stage. That was all done months ago. He WOULD NOT have access to the sales numbers in the first weekend, as those would not be known in China. The cumulative pre-orders would only be known in Cupertino at the C-level. Sounds like somebody needed to generate an entry point for a new position.",2024-09-16
@Blowback2 Super cycle doesn't look like it's happening based on pre-order numbers.   This stock will likely get repriced down to $170 range.,2024-09-16
"AI = Pump and Dump....   Iphone 16 is basically the same as the Iphone 15...  You need to Wow costumers, which Apple has stopped doing.",2024-09-16
Apple has more units in stock ahead of release.  They know this upgrade cycle will be huge.,2024-09-16
