"@Outdexer Buffett's been buying CB. Probably accounts for the outperformance. That one day the market was down big, CB was up. He was probably buying more. If you want to own AIG, buying it at that lower monthly channel trend line is a great place to do so.",2024-09-13
"Thanks for the article, I appreciate the comparison to Chubb as a market leader.  AIG seems to be trading at what I see as a better level than CB relative to their long term moving averages, due in part to CB outperforming by 15% over past 6 months.  I'm probably overthinking by saying I'm continuing to watch and would like to add to AIG in the 60's, especially given its 6 month trend heading in that direction.  Personally I'd ignore 2020 when drawing the long-term price channel; connecting to the 2019 top might make a little more sense.  Or just use a very long term moving average envelope",2024-09-13
