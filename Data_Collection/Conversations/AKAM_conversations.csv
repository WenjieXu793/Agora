"Thank you for your detailed analysis, somehow the market is focussing to much on the declining CDN business which will have a negligible effect on the overall figures as the security and the compute outgrow them.Some basic interpolation on the growth figures from Q2, indicate that the CDN business currently holds 33.6% of revenues, in the coming years that will decline towards 27.4% in 2025, 21.9% in 2026 and 17.2% in 2017. As growth of Security and Compute outgrow CDN, total revenue increase can reasonably be expected to accelerate to 6.8% in 2025, 8.8% in 2026 and 10.5% in 2027. That combined with margin expansion and a potential share buyback should drive the share price higher.",2024-09-27
