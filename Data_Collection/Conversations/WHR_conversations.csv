"@isohappy Just lucky timing, yes.  I try not to bottom feed, but Whirlpool below $100 was just too tempting.",2024-10-04
"@Bobbie B My appliance repairman agrees with that.  They're built to be disposable after a while, because of the builtd and the fact that parts become unavailable and/or extremely expensive. Not so with the brands WHR manufactures.",2024-10-04
@al_chemyst   I own four WHR appliances and my appliance installer/repairman agrees about the repair record.,2024-10-04
@Live from Tahiti   That has not been my experience and I own four WHR-madehousehold appliances,2024-10-04
"My appliance repairman's favorites. He likes Whirlpool because their appliances last a long time, and replacement parts are readily available. As an owner of four of their household appliances, I can vouch for their reliability and longevity.   I just bought a small lot today because I like the dividend and its prospects, so I was glad to read this article.",2024-10-04
@Dutch Holland I'm in the same boat. I was in at $92/93 and am happy to ride that out and add on dips.,2024-10-03
"@Live from Tahiti The reviews of appliance repairman on YT mostly say WHR has the best repair record in the biz, for all but one appliance (which escapes my memory atm).",2024-10-02
"Investing is serious business and I normally stick to the script in my investment decisions. I am fortunate to be able, sometimes, to ‘play a hunch’. It may not always be the smartest play but it adds a little spice to my investing life. I have been nibbling at WHR for months, building a small position.  I will collect the dividend for now and see where it goes. Thank you for your insight.",2024-10-01
"Long on WHR. Besides dividend have written Jan 25 call options to boost yield further. Agree with other responder, WHR product quality has declined. I’d love to have my options called in Jan. Thx for the through article Brad.",2024-10-01
"Thank you for the interesting and very informative article.Whirlpool makes a very low quality product.  It will catch up to them. I’m staying far, far away.",2024-10-01
"I hope you are right. I am under water with this stock big time. While it is great to get the generous dividend, the capital erosion has been substantial. I am hoping to get back as much as possible.",2024-10-01

"Great article, kind of company I like to invest and get paid to wait. Will wait though until div rate is over 7%.",2024-10-01
"@Johnbilik You are right.  Layoffs there are abundant.  But I am sure that helps costs, but shows demand is way off.",2024-10-01
"A lot of layoffs which probably helps costs.  But I see no evidence of growth yet.  None of my friends who have been laid off have been called back and they are looking to move to better areas, so even if they want more workers, it may be tough.  Agree with JohnBilik",2024-10-01
"@Johnbilik To be fair about it, WHR has always had tough competition. GE Appliances and Electrolux have been around for decades. Bosch has been around for quite a while, although admittedly they're a fairly new contender in the US. But yea WHR has got their work cut out for them.",2024-10-01
"@Johnbilik  No question the 'moat is not as wide' today, however the 5-year total return consensus is 17% per year, superior to the S&P's 12%.  As always, thank you for reading and commenting.  All the best",2024-10-01
"Whirlpool’s stock is currently undervalued  because the company is facing challenges- higher operating costs and tough competition from brands like Electrolux and Bosch. The company’s outlook for 2024 shows lower-than-expected earnings and revenue, which is concerning, and Whirlpool has a high level of debt. Despite some cost-cutting efforts, their outlook looks pretty weak.",2024-10-01
