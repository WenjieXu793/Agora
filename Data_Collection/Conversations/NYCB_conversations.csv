@Data Doge I want to hear if they can provide color (if it’s even possible as I’m not sure how difficult it could be) on how these cuts will factor into their categorization of loans under “classified.” All their prior commentary was ignoring the possibility of rate cuts. The bank caught a couple upgrades. I think these analysts are lazy. They kinda just follow each other’s lead. Should this trade at book value right now? No. Should it be at 60%? Also probably a ‘no’ with these tailwinds coming.,2024-10-08 12:07:12.490416
@steve1189 hard to gauge the idea without knowing your cost basis.,2024-10-08 12:07:12.490416
"The reverse split has done nothing for the bank - it had lows pre and post split that were within pennies of each other. Like all other banks, the FED rate cut has inspired some growth.As both a long term shareholder and depositor I have said time and again, that the markets continued knee j3rk reaction (actual word violates SA rules) to the news regarding the portfolio was overblown. (So where are those failures everyone was yammering about?) They are almost at the needed CET-1 ratio (which necessitated the div. rate cut and was brought about by the FED's reckless marrying them to a 3rd bank pushing them into a new level for assets (where was the BOD when you needed them?) Eventually they'll raise the dividend again. Given the amount of my exposure I don't believe I'll put any more money into this bank - may just wait till I'm close to even and then get out.",2024-10-08 12:07:12.490416
@hbcf agreed. Like you mentioned deposit costs should come down substantially as they've cut the interest rates on savings accounts too. I just wonder how sticky the retail deposits will actually be now that rates have been cut. Will be interesting to see.,2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
I'm long NYCB having purchased and posted when it was $3 or so  ( plus a few shares higher ).  Im still mildly optimistic.I came across SSBI yesterday - Bank. of Santa Rosa wich is selling at $7 37 and about half tangible book of $14.45  Its net interest margin has declined as has overall loans ( by a bit) Credit Quality looks a bit worse than average due to large loans on 3 ag properties but they claim their reserves adequately cover them - using current appraisals. .  I mention this because it has some similarities to NYCB although its much smaller and not covered by analysts. Take a look if you like  I bought some at $7.45 this morning.,2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
"So assuming we finish the year with 100 basis points of cuts, shall we just multiply TBV of $18.29 by 1.032 to achieve TBV of $18.87? My understanding has been that the bank management has been executing under the impression there would be no cuts and that cuts would just be gravy. I suspect that their “classified” portion of their loans will decrease as the rates come down. If they continue aggressive pricing on loans, they might continue getting loan payoffs as landlords look to other banks to refinance. That frees up capital. Beloved capital. When some of their high interest CDs roll off too, their expenses are likely to fall significantly as they also cut those warehousing costs.",2024-10-03 00:00:00.000000
"@Joseph Parrish Citibank pays a dividend and is trading at 75% TBV.  NYCB does not pay a dividend (negligible) and is at 50% TBV.  NYCB can't be at close to Citibank valuation, it has to be less.",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@Bargain99 , I'm not as versed in their ""story,"" but if they have enough cash for buybacks at a discount to TBV, that right there is likely to create upside.  Even while the stock tumbled to $40, TBV per share was growing.",2024-09-30 00:00:00.000000
"@Joseph Parrish @tfizzle Citigroup is at market price of $60 and the TBV is about $85; and it also pays a dividend.  If you believe the fair value for NYCB is at $20, then Citibank is undervalued at this time ?",2024-09-29 00:00:00.000000
"@tfizzle TBV, so about $18.  Turnaround could bring a fair value into the $20s.",2024-09-28 00:00:00.000000
I have been in and out of this for a while and generally have made decent money buying when down. My in price is $10 share. What do you think fair value is at the moment?,2024-09-27 00:00:00.000000
Not a bad idea. A little caution and circumspection going forward might be better than trying to remediate risk with more risk.Long & Overweight NYCB,2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
@txholdup We tend to use that term THE MARKET like it is one person and it makes sense. Not just NYCB but all stocks I hold and as I do not claim to be an expert I can be honest and say HUH.,2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
"Warren is apparently firing this salvo to let everyone know she is unhappy. She apparently continues to be upset by home foreclosing that Otting/Mnuchin did after they took over bank OneWest in 2008.She also hasn't liked the response she's been getting from the current comptroller of the currency, Michael Hsu, to earlier letters she sent to him. FYI, the OCC has already been imposing IMCR's on some banks with heavy CRE exposure; S&P recently reported on this. And even if the OCC had already talked with NYCB about an IMCR, we wouldn't necessarily know about it since it is supposed to be confidential. And, of course, anyone paying attention to NYCB knows that almost from the beginning of their involvement, Otting/Mnuchin have spoken of their desire to reduce the bank's CRE exposure relative to total loans and, as best as I can tell, have been acting with alacrity to do so. So to sum it up, dear Sen. Warren, I think you can take it for granted that the people who have a billion dollars invested in NYCB are doing their darndest to make sure the bank doesn't go under. Hopefully there are better uses of your time than writing letters like this.",2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
"@hbcf According to the latest 10Q, series B pfd are carried on the balance sheet at about $1343/shr, far less than what they paid to redeem it (if my math is accurate).  The value inside NYCB is being sucked out through dilution and bad decisions.",2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
"@Herbert 5223 she seems vengeful. I bet she opened up a savings account years ago & did not get a toaster. Would make me angry, too — toast is good.",2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
ok give mnuchin his 1B back and let NYCB crash. Simple. You did it little lizzie. You saved the people again like you did all those other time....,2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
@NV_GARY the market is reacting to an overweight upgrade not Warren.,2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
@LenceFlatu Barclay's has a sell on NYCB?  Or HSBC? Doesn't read like it does.,2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
She is just trying to harass Mnuchin.  The Fed should throw the letter away.,2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
