"Stock is up 6.3% pre-market. Anyone have any idea why? ORI always seemed like a potential takeover candidate and the stock performance over the past couple weeks (coupled with this morning’s strength pre-market) makes me wonder if an announcement might be coming up? Or it is just noise. Appreciate anyone’s thoughts on the subject if they wish to share.Happy investing, everyone!",2024-09-17
