@qwerty11 25% down from premarket but the stock price recently started under $2 per share. At 25% pullback is really nothing if you run a one-year chart. A very natural reaction until more news with teeth is released. I believe it will be so after researching the team. The tight China connection would concern me much more if it were not for the long-term legitimate credentials of the executive team.,2024-10-06
@cmc89129 I guess many investors will jump in if its price ever dropped to around $10.,2024-10-06
Buying SMMT on any significant weakness might be a good idea. I'm targeting the $9-$14 range,2024-10-05

"""...Ivonescimab is a highly intriguing drug, and Summit a highly intriguing investment opportunity, but we need more clarity...""Yeah, a real problem. This company doesn't fly under the radar. Any ""clarity"" and this one will fly to the moon or will go to hell instant.As I said a few times in the past...when in doubt (mainly valuation wise), buy some Akeso. Lower valuation, further ahead, already a real business and they'll catch the ""easy money"" via milestones + royalties, should there be a Summit success.",2024-10-04

The timing is good for the company to increase its cash runway.,2024-09-24
"@don blomberg I wouldn’t be so sure. The drug doesn’t look like a certain blockbuster, and it comes with limited rights for development and commercialization, I don’t see reasons for FDA or European or Japanese agencies to accept only Chinese data, so the company will have to spend more on clinical trials in Europe, US and Japan.",2024-09-24
"@effiiciency Thanks for your insights.  It helps with such volatility.  I do have a position, with 5k+ shrs. at a $2.20 basis.  So, not too invested, but tough to pull the trigger on gains when I foresee this going much higher with Duggar’s background and experience.  Thanks.",2024-09-24
"@endurantgal Not even survival, but progression-free survival. We have not been given any information on overall survival.",2024-09-24
"@Brendan O'Boyle you kidding? The 5 year survival rate with keytruda is 19.4%. Most patients will be interested in increasing their chances. Lung cancer 5 years survival rate through all stages combined is 28%, keytruda is just one of the small number of options that works. For comparison: 5 years survival rate through all stages combined for colon cancer is 63%.",2024-09-23
"@All hail the Beatles the difference between Keytruda and this drug is 6 months longer survival based on Chinese data, and a questionable tox profile. After US trials the difference may shrink, and the toxicity may be higher. There are plenty of contenders in lung cancer space.",2024-09-23
"@Potato-Head Have a position?  Hang in there. Insider sales, after 800% within 200 days it would be natural to take some off the table.  Your operative word is ""portion"" Personally, I took some off the table at $31.  Eventually Iill buy them back. IF there was a true panic, which you may be interpreting, those shares would be going out in negoitated blocks with market maker.Could also be bait for short interest. Creates eventual demand.  Insiders can also buy back shares. The trend is there but it's volatile. IF you have a correct position size and other positions, you should be able to weather the heat.   No pain No gain.Secondary offering is initially dilluitive.  Needs to be digested. Hang in there.",2024-09-23
