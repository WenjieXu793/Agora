"@Iron Eagle idk the answer to that.  Other than analysts scaring people off by posting the dividend could be cut I see nothing. (Other than the obvious it missed in total revenue but was inline otherwise)   I have a contact at one of the top brokers and he says no one at his office has heard of HrZn but he looked at it and loved it . He’s been putting clients in it now that he’s aware of it I know BDCs don’t do as well in a rate reduction cycle they do better on the way up or at he bottom or top , so any uncertainty scares people.  I see this as an unusual opportunity to buy .  The analysts scared people off AGNC all during covid and rate hikes alll the way down to $7.50 I bought it like  crazy.   They never cut the dividend !!!!   I’ve been paid 14.5 percent or more that whole time and I am up $3 a share now. .   This COULD be that same opportunity.",2024-09-25
"@1TurboTrader - apparently that is a naughty word nowadays....Back to business at hand...what is causing the most recent bleeding? The dividend has already been set for the rest of the year so, is this really about a dividend cut....or is something else at play here? Recession fears causing an early exit here? The stock has been trading above its lower NAV for some time but why are is it NOW reverting to NAV? I am rather new to this stock....have they ever cut dividend before?",2024-09-25
@1TurboTrader HRZN's NAV has almost been cut in half in the last 5 years.,2024-09-24
"Will see about the cut, so far so good. The dividends are covered to the end of this year. HRZN is a stable company, and it could be a great time to add more.",2024-09-24
"Take a look at HRZN. It’s typically flat over 5 years   Down a little right now because of panic. (Stoopid panic)  management knows it’s bread and butter is the income investor they will do the best they can. To not cut the dividend.  But even if they had to short term during rate declines , it would (likely) come back when rates bottom and stabilize. You take a company like KDP Keri doctor pepper, it pays a 2.45 % dividend. .  It’s FLAT over 5 years !   Yet it’s an all BUY signal SA - WS- And  Quant . BUY BUY BUY HRZN at 12% + dividend and a FLAT over 5 year graph could cut its dividend for quite some time and you’d still come out ahead of the KDP stock holder.  So why is HRZN rated a sell and KDP rated a BUY because people can’t look at things objectively.  And because most analysts don’t look at a stock through a distant lens or the lens of an income investor. What are you gonna do sell HRZN now at a low price because MAYBE they may cut and buy it back when the dividend doesn’t go away or comes back at a premium ???  Yeah that’d be smart.",2024-09-20
Hrzn is likely to do just fine and I think management knows how important it is to hold steady in the dividend.  They aren’t stoopid they know share price stability is dependent on a steady and really reliable dividend.  That’s why people BUY HRZN  for its share price stability and its dividend stability. They have several options to fund the dividends as stated earlier by the management.—————————————————————I’d like to addd that it’s ridiculous that grown adults can’t type “  aren’t Stu. PID “ in a post on this site.  Without changing its spelling.  What are we children here.,2024-09-12
