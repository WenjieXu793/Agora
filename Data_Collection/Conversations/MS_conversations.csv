"@techy46 Sounds like something a poor person would say, which begs the question why are you even on an investing site to begin with.  Cash has zero risk and earns over 5% which better than most stocks, any one whose not a fool would know that.",2024-09-24
Why does CFPB have any say in bank regulations?CFPB is just another US agency with quasi legal overreach.,2024-09-23
"@Mike2021 Disagree,  FDIC was not formed to protect corp payroll accounts.Indiviudals w/ $250K+ in any single bank account are fools.",2024-09-23
"FDIC needs to raise savings limits to $500k or a $1m, it was raised to $250k during 2008, due to massive inflation it should be raised again.",2024-09-20
It does seem as if this last proposal was written by the NY Fed. Doesn't look so good on Main Street.,2024-09-20
"Makes sense ... less capital = more odds of failure = more odds of FDIC payouts and capital raises. Of course FDIC would be peeved. Of course, the original Fed proposal was going to immediately put a whole bunch of banks underwater, illustrating just how fragile things are, so they couldn't do it.Stay far away from banking sector. Business risk is high and LT returns on bank stocks are uncompetitive anyway.My two cents. Make if it what you will :)",2024-09-20
Yeah..whata shame the Fed didn't work with Lehman Bros. in 2008....just saying...,2024-09-20
"looks like little muskie shot off his mouth and got the attention of the secret service, lol""Elon Musk, the rightwing Tesla CEO, made an inflammatory post on X asking why no one had targeted Joe Biden or Kamala Harris.Bloomberg News sought records from the Secret Service regarding Musk’s tweet, and if it was being investigated for it. What the outlet received in response isn’t quite definitive, but does indicate that the agency was aware of what he said:The Secret Service investigates when they’re trying to determine whether a person poses an imminent threat to one of their protectees. Threatening the US president or vice president is a felony that can carry a hefty fine or up to five years in prison.FOIA Files sent Freedom of Information Act requests to the Secret Service’s Protective Intelligence and Assessment Division, Office of Protective Operations and Office of Investigations for documents and emails referencing Musk’s post.On Wednesday, the agency responded to the requests by saying records it has about Musk’s post were “compiled for law enforcement purposes” and are being withheld because “disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.”We followed up with the Secret Service’s FOIA division and were told that the Protective Intelligence Division advised that it cannot release any records because of “enforcement proceedings.”The agency “is aware of the social media post made by Elon Musk,” said Nate Herring, a spokesperson for the Secret Service. “As a matter of practice, we do not comment on matters involving protective intelligence. We can say, however, that the Secret Service investigates all threats related to our protectees.” """,2024-09-19
"@osv1 The antitrust laws address more than price fixing.  This was clearly a group boycott.  If you knew anything about antitrust, you would see that it is pretty much the definition of a group boycott. It will be up to the appellate courts to decide if it was legal or not.",2024-09-18
"@Ed Grey Damages are easily provable from lost ad rev's.  Collusion is established by the fact they had a group set up with the express purpose of cancelling advertising.  The reason is obvious.  If a few companies cancelled ads but others continued, then the ones cancelling would be at a marketing disadvantage.  The conspiracy only worked if there was concerted action.  That's kind of the whole point of the antitrust laws, to prohibit concerted action or conspiracies to restrict trade.",2024-09-18
"@BakkenPro this has nothing to do with price fixing and it's not a ""group boycott"", the media group proved that twitter was putting their advertisers ads up beside racist right-wing extremist trash posts.it's funny how you people ignore actual relevant facts when making posts... as i stated earlier, little muskie has already been dinged in court for his behavior:""Musk tried to ‘punish’ critics, judge rules, in tossing a lawsuitIn a win for hate-speech researchers, a federal judge in California dismisses X’s lawsuit under the state’s anti-SLAPP law.A federal judge in California on Monday threw out the entirety of a lawsuit by Elon Musk’s X against the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), ruling that the lawsuit was an attempt to silence X’s critics.""it's funny how some posters out here think that it's o.k. for a billionaire to use his unlimited wealth to destroy democracy and free speech.",2024-09-18

"@eugene_ And it's not like they'll go back to advertising there.I wonder how it would do in a hypothetical IPO. Probably much better with some steadier, independent CEO in place, and Musk out of the management.",2024-09-17
"@osv1 Fidelity's valuation is less than the $13 billion loan amount. Maybe the banks could repossess Twitter and do an IPO. I suppose their collateral is only a portion of the $44 billion purchase price, though.",2024-09-17

"@2021investor Lower Mortgage rates will lead to refinancing at lower rates, devaluing mortgages via higher CPR, and leading to lower interest components. If you think service fees will salvage the lost value, then go ahead. The only thing going for banks in a declining-rate environment is 1) IBD, and 2) Lower funding cost + higher credit spread on loan book, but credit event risk is usually higher when rates first start dropping, so, that's why you're seeing banks reduce duration on loans (lower returns), I use $MS as an example.",2024-09-13
"@Pearl Gray Equity and Research Why not? Nobody's taking out mortgages right now. With lower rates, the floodgates will open again.",2024-09-12
@thirdcamper Thanks for that. I’m just skeptical about the price and prefer European Banks for now.,2024-09-12
"Fair assessment. I agree there is no margin of error and it's not a bargain, but I also think fwd PEG is worth looking at as a metric in this case. I believe MS will justify its price through its compelling growth, combined with the dividend and dividend growth.  A standout quality bank, trading cheaper than JPM.",2024-09-12
