"@dlevine007 wishful thinking sir, oil not going to $100 let alone $150",2024-10-06
I’m wondering how $100-150 or more per Barrell oil might affect the stock price of RIG.  This could happen if Kamala Harris wins and Isreal blocks the straight of Hormuz.,2024-10-06

"@DeZe100 Come on. Read the news again:""Constellation stated that the $1 billion total includes all mobilization fees, extension option clauses and additional services requested by Petrobras.""The number even includes extension options thus likely resulting in a clean dayrate closer to $400k or even less (depending on the extension term).",2024-09-24
"Esgian reports Constellation winner of PBR’s Roncador tender:“Petrobras has awarded two floating rig contracts to Constellation Oil Services for work in the Roncador field in the Campos Basin offshore Brazil. Valued at $1 billion, the two contracts will see Constellation drillship Laguna Star and Hanwha Drilling newbuild Tidal Action operate for Petrobras for around 2.5 years.The contracts are expected to commence in the third quarter of 2025. Constellation stated that the $1 billion total includes all mobilization fees, extension option clauses and additional services requested by Petrobras. Laguna Star is a 10,000-ft 6th generation drillship, owned and managed by Constellation. The rig is currently under contract to Petrobras, with work under this term expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. After this, Laguna Star will undergo class inspections and adjustments before beginning work under the new Roncador contract. Tidal Action is a newbuild 12,000-ft 7th generation drillship, built at the Hanwha Ocean (formerly DSME) yard in South Korea. The rig was previously called West Libra and was ordered by Seadrill in 2013. Hanwha Ocean company Hanwha Drilling will become the owner of Tidal Action upon its departure from the shipyard. Constellation will manage the rig during its contract with Petrobras, the first time Constellation will have operated third-party owned ultra-deepwater rig. The rigs will be used for work in the Roncador field, which is operated by Petrobras with a 75% interest. Equinor has a 25% interest in the field. The Roncador field has been producing since 1999 and the Petrobras and Equinor consortium has been involved in an increased oil recovery project at the field in recent years. “login.esgian.com/...",2024-09-23

@qwerty11 Why would anyone reasonably expect a shortseller outfit to put out a report on Transocean? The company is not a fraud and its business will improve substantially going forward.,2024-09-22

"If the day rates expected to reach $600 k in the ""future"" does that mean anything about the potential size of business  this industry will get including Transocean and if  Transocean expected to be profitable next year with improved cash flow... again the debt issue its really not issue by the end of 2025  really  Rig as  company does not have to be 0 debts  , the past 4 years we were  worried that their backlog  to dry out because they were not  adding any new contracts  and their backlog dropped down significantly.. now the new contracts are coming along so reducing the debt to be less than $ 5 billion is plausible and that's what the management are shooting for .. again, the catalyst is the business flow and  the rest will follow",2024-09-19
@KingRig You might be on to something. Recent presentation projects only $30M in CapEx in the last two quarters of this year after averaging $110M over the last four quarters.,2024-09-19

"@DeZe100 Quarterly financial reports show increasing revenues, but decreasing cash flows. So far, it appears that increased day rates have been offset by increased operating expenses and maintenance CapEx.Looking out to FY25, it looks like we might expect profitability, increased cashflow, and debt reduction.",2024-09-19
"@Thomas Prescott Your problem is ""if cash flow does not improve"".  It is and will continue to do so.  Spend some time on the FSR and new contracts announced since the last FSR.  New FSR will be released in October.Also, you might want to look at the debt runway (SEC filings) which has been extended.",2024-09-19
@Nicklaas cash flow has been improving.  And it will continue to do so at increasing rates.  Day rates rising along with contract durations.RIG experiencing higher revenues with operating leverage and reduced capx.,2024-09-19
"@Nicklaas I don't doubt that book values are inflated for many if not most of RIG assets. I'm most concerned about debt continuing to grow with very little cash flow. If cash flow does not improve, I would expect to see further dilution as it will be difficult or impossible to leverage the business any further.",2024-09-19
Thanks for updating on the RIG debt situation Mr Prescott.The leverage alone places RIG in the too difficult box for me now.Yet do you have insights whether  or in how far the substantial write down vs book values indicates similiar write down requirements for other RIG assets?Might this trigger debt covenants?RegardsN,2024-09-18
