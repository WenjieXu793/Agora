"@Weebler Finance I totally agree - for now. My observation is that hardware suppliers have a certain headwind against outsize market returns. This is EVEN IF they do pretty good. So I am at a loss why Novanta has such a high valuation of over 6 billion when their EBITDA (that is before even interest, taxes and capex) is 200m or so. I cannot help but think this is a guaranteed reversion to the mean situation. I follow another company IPGP which is only doing fiber laser in relatively lower margin and lower value end market of EV, oil&gas, etc..But they have 1 billion+ cash on the balance sheet! I give it to Novanta for seizing the opportunity to get into niche, high value markets but another example is $tdy. A great diversified company with good markets. But even that one has a hard time making gains. For some reason, software is 'eating the world' these days. I don't know, however, if this situation will reverse ever. Capex cycles are notoriously boom and bust while software/services is a little more steady. And of course having a platform like an Apple is worth more even in a recession. This one I always thought would be a good value around $100 per share. If they are smart, I still think they should do a merger in stock. They can then acquire something much cheaper for a stock that is perhaps 200-300% overvalued. They will get in return an asset worth more than they paid, especially when the stock declines. I am not sure if this is unethical. Well, the buyer can always sell their shares at the peak if they want. Or even a 80% stock, 20% cash deal. Stock is currency, and if it is overvalued, you can in fact turn overvaluation INTO value. I remember Berkshire guy saying overvaluation in a stock is undesirable. But i do not understand why. Overvaluation can be a benefit if you take advantage of it. You do not actually harm your shareholders and you may harm the seller's shareholders, although a weaker smaller company with potential might still prefer the higher priced shares. Sell immediately after the merger. Even if it goes down 30%, it's still a good value for everyone.",2024-09-03
"@bluescorpion0 Thanks for you comment. I feel that component supplier companies are critical, without a doubt, but I'm not sure if they're safer than end user facing companies, in general. Just like end user companies, these players face intense competition, headwinds, and soft demand environments.I agree though, Novanta capitalized on great market positioning early on.",2024-09-03
"This one is a picks and shovel dealer to the medical field, similar to how Broadcom or Nvidia are picks and shovel dealers to AI field. It is debateable whether end-user companies should be worthier investments. E.g. Apple or Microsoft instead of Nvidia, ISRG instead of Novanta...The benefit of the base suppliers however is that if the end-users lose some of their monopolies to competitors, companies like Novanta can supply all the competitors too. In some ways, if you believe that such monopolies are weakening due to competition, this is the safer play. I also follow some other laser and component companies and none have done so well. I suspect having chosen a good end market early has paid dividends for Novanta. They also have no cash left for acquisitions I see. If they are smart, they will make a deal on an all-cash basis at all time highs and get an asset that is worth more for a lower price. But they better do it soon before the stock price collapses!",2024-09-03
