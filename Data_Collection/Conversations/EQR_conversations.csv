"@Philipsonh Okay, well, I suppose it depends on the area. In mine, I've seen three different prices on the same day, but the prices are definitely close to each other.",2024-08-26
@SilverBandit They change the prices every day and the only reason one location would be different than another is that they haven't gotten around to see the other's prices yet. It isn't worth it to save 1 or 2 cents by driving around looking for that type of savings. It was $3.43 per gal around here yesterday.,2024-08-25
"@Capital Kong Okay, we get that you support RealPage and have a financial interest in it continuing. Nevertheless, from a legal standpoint, RealPage will likely lose. ""RealPage’s software ensures landlords are “driving every possible opportunity to increase price even in the most downward trending or unexpected conditions,” the company said, according to the government’s complaint. In another instance, a landlord called the tool “classic price fixing,” according to the complaint.""",2024-08-24
"I couldn't get a good number of illegal immigrants for the last 4 years, but 2022, showed 2.2 million. Let just average it to 8 million for 4 years which hopefully is close to the number. The people need a roof over their head and that means living in a house or apartment. So, you when you have an increase in demand for almost anything and the supply is unable to increase fast enough, then you get higher prices. So why are prices higher in some areas? Increased demand! In some areas of the country rents and vacancies are down due to overbuilding. The companies reporting this over supply expects it to balance out over the next year to eighteen months. Keeping track of what your competition is charging for a product is done all the time. I am not sure what data Real Pages is providing their customers. If it is just statistics, it doesn't seem this would be against the law. Perhaps there is more than meets the eye in reading this article. I guess we will have to wait until the trial or out of court settlement to find out the gist of the case.",2024-08-23
"@Izet Exactly.  If it is illegal for the property manager at one apartment complex to call the property manager at another complex to discuss and set pricing, then it is CERTAINLY illegal to do the same thing on a city-wide, state-wide, or nationwide scale.  And if it is illegal to directly contact competitors over the phone, and set pricing, using a third-party app as an intermediary DOES NOT magically make it become legal or acceptable.",2024-08-23
"@The Rutledge Group Wow, that sure is smart.  I would imagine that most people want to ""pay [their] rent"" and utilities, but they also must have money left over to eat, pay for healthcare and insurance, etc.  The lawsuit against RealPage alleges--and I believe--that this software platform has facilitated competing apartment complexes to share confidential pricing/occupancy data, and coordinate pricing in direct violation of state and federal anti-trust laws.  Aside from the fact that such anti-competitive behavior runs afoul of the law, it also has the effect of extracting so much money from tenants that it is difficult to ""pay [their] rent"" and still have money to eat and cover the rest of their bills.  This has become a huge national problem, and unfortunately this DOJ lawsuit is needed to alleviate the problem.",2024-08-23
@Avid Reader55 The donor class owns Harris. It is all for laid out infront of everyone to see during the DNC.,2024-08-23
"@Logan Kane I've seen the software, and I've done rent pricing manually, which is time intensive. Sitting down with a property manager, leasing manager, various regional managers, marketing managers, owner and talking about leasing/pricing on a frequent basis diverts everyone's attention away from a ton of other tasks, it's literally a huge time suck for something I'd argue isn't the core service of the business. The property software helps save some time with various tasks and kind of helps setting the price, which I know there are even specific people/jobs that still need to get involved b/c the software can be mediocre (but big picture still reduces a lot of time/admin overhead). To say the obvious rent prices fall in markets at various locations and class of property, and this software is in those markets; funny enough it's happening now in a lot of places as the lawsuit is going on. The core driver of housing prices relates to the supply/demand of housing. If housing isn't economical to rent/run then no one builds housing. The more economical housing is, the more people build until it's questionable/negative returns. You are talking about software that helps with automating admin tasks (which every industry is using computers/software to do similar tasks,) this makes housing more economical and more people willing to build it. Some of the points in the actual lawsuit are really questionable, housing has one of the most fragmented ownership groups, and even if you are outside of the industry, you could see what every building is offering for rent as a consumer, the advertising of properties is probably on a couple of consolidated websites that I'd argue have more power. If the above article is correct, it's saying AI? AI is really recent, this software has been around for a long time....the math/statistics around pricing something like a room which isn't sold and has some marginal cost is old and is taught in universities for a long time. People are just lobbing lawsuits probably for political reasons but if it works, some people go back to the stone age with pen and paper or realistically people can still use computers so anyone with enough scale or know how are just going to recreate/hire the talent to recreate the same pricing mechanism a couple of hundred times over. I guess then the bigger landlords would have an advantage over the small ones who might actually not know about the math/statistics around pricing.",2024-08-23
@Izet Some like to call it “Price Gouging” by apartment owners….$$$$,2024-08-23
@Logan Kane And the airlines agreed to a large settlement as to the charges. They had no defense.,2024-08-23
What about major investment firms purchasing 1000's of homes thus making the supply leaner causing price increases. What does the govt think about that. Try buying a home with the other bidder a multi B$ company.,2024-08-23
"""Price Gouging"" among apartment owners....?Rental inflation or price gouging underway by apartment owner....",2024-08-23
"@Capital Kong this is price fixing, full stop. I have extensive experience with the software. Don’t believe the PR",2024-08-23
"@Logan Kane no. Without some automation, you need more labor. An apartment would have to focus way more time towards on site staff/leasing/ regional managers/owners discussing this way more often than already. People's times are already stretched, you'd need more people and causes more cost which makes apartments less economical and less desirable to build. Plus, many apartments are owned by smaller groups and additional staff really eats into time/profits and without some assistance are going to price too high and have higher vacancy and have to manually try to adjust for seasonality/marketing/job creation/etc. You are basically talking about some automation or using a computer.",2024-08-23
