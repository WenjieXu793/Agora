"I've just become aware of Arrow, but this is the second time I've seen this comment recently (diff. company) ""ARW to continue returning capital to shareholders...""by share buybacks. How does a company that pays no dividend return capital to shareholders by buying shares? If they were to buy all the shares but for 1000 the few shareholders would still not get any capital back. It may represent a bigger slice of the company, none of which is accessible absent an action by the BOD or a bankruptcy.",2024-08-22
