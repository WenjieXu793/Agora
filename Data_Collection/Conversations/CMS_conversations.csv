"@Eileen Dover Thanks for your comment. I expect CMS.PR.B, and most preferred stocks, to jump in price as rates decline -and not until. CMS.PR.B spread over TBill rates should remain about the same.  I know this is not new info for you and I appreciate your comments. I would not be surprised to see Fed rates to drop to the 3.5% to 4.0% range, especially as the economy slows.",2024-09-12
@Philipsonh   Correct. The par is $100 but if it gets called the price to shareholders is $110.,2024-09-12
"@George Fisher If CMS.PR.B went up 20% in price as you think is possible, the yield would drop to about 4.6%, well below what investors would consider good for income. Thank you for your reply. We are looking for yields which would be a good amount over CD/TBill yields when they collapse after multiple Fed cuts.",2024-09-12
"If the issue is called, they pay $110 per share, though face value is $100.",2024-09-12
I have requesting SA links their stock page to the preferred symbol $CMS.PR.B.  Here is the link to their page.seekingalpha.com/...,2024-09-12
"@Eileen Dover Thanks for reading and posting your comment.  I appreciate your input.  I will admit CMS.PR.B is the lowest yielding preferred I have recently purchased.I also agree there are many other preferreds with higher yields, but feel the niche of utility subsidiary preferreds offer an overlooked opportunity, especially as we face the strong possibility of a recession ahead. As the core of an income bucket, I am pretty strict on my preferred share requirements with virtually unwavering requirements of cumulative (which means no financials) and fixed rate preferably.  I have been looking at non-callable CDs 5-yr and under maturity and find their yield to be lacking as the impending rate cut is already being priced in. I think it is reasonable to expect a CMS.PR.B price gain of between 10% and 20% in addition to its qualified yield of 5.6% as I am looking for the Feds to cut rates by as much a 200 bp over the next 18-24 months.  Canadian utility preferreds currently offer higher yields than CMS.PR.B and have the advantage of currency exposure with the strong potential of a falling US$, goosing up both post-currency-conversion cash yields and price. I own Fortis, Emera and Canadian Utilities preferreds.",2024-09-12
"@gastro4 I fully agree and expect that as rates drop, the price will move closer to its par, adding to the total return.  While there are other higher yielding preferreds available, I think CMS.PR.B checks the boxes of safety, quality, qualified, and an acceptable yield. Thanks for stopping by and posting your comment.",2024-09-12
Thanks for the idea. A highly rated utility preferred paying a qualified 5.6% is interesting. Seems like an interest rate play!,2024-09-12
Thank you for the column on CMS & their Pfds. The yields are well under 6% where so many solid Pfds and BB still yield 7%-9% (see columns by Excellent SA authors for ideas).  It may still make sense to jump more heavily into CDs or TBills ASAP before the Fed cuts rates and those drop as well.,2024-09-12
