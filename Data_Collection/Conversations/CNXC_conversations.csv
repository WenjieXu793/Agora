@Deepak Sinha Valuations are genuinely cheap with strong forward earnings on offer; Baird recently reiterated that few days back.in.investing.com/...We suspect the stock isn't likely taking off as large parts of the market are fearful that Concentrix's BPO capabilities aren't compelling in a world where conversational AI is gaining traction.,2024-10-08 11:44:12.012268
"@Deepak Sinha Yes, right now the market doesn't believe customer experience services companies and is pricing in that they're going to disappear. Recently the CEO of TTEC offered to acquire it for 6.7 times EV/EBITDA (currently CNXC is trading at 6.2)Differences? TTEC gross margins of 22% vs 36% CNXC.  TTEC lost $313M in the last 12 months vs CNXC earning $200M. Why would a CEO buy a business that won't survive? And on top of that, doing so at a valuation higher than CNXC's current valuation.",2024-10-08 11:44:12.012268
@The Alpha Sieve I just don't get the valuation here. This seems irrationally cheap specially after the fall after the earning call. Is the market really mispricing this and the stock is a bargain...or is this a death spiral and am I catching a falling fine.I went through the last earning calls transcript and the Q&A and found nothing alarming. I did get that there would be some short term pain and expenses due to onboarding of new customers but this should be a long term positive and catalyst. The other positive I read was that they were moving away from low margin customers and were adding a number of clients with higher margins. I would appreciate inputs from the author and others following this stock closely.,2024-10-06 00:00:00.000000

@abdulmoiz1254 thoughts on the volume?  5.6 million shares traded yesterday.  Also sales to share price.CNXC Revenues TTD $8.7 billion.  Market cap $3.3 billion.  WMT Revenues TTD $665 billion.  Market Cat $642 billion.Apparently the patient has no pulse.,2024-09-27 00:00:00.000000

"They estimate $11+ per share 2024 earnings, they now provide nearly 3% div yield, and this equates to a 4.6 fwd pe based on these estimates...  hmmm,  street sure doesnt seem to have this right...  AI or not.",2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
"@Whognu53 nop. That's not what I'm doing. I don't care about any short term movements.I sold a jan 55 put, for 6.5$.I'm pretty confortable with a 48.5$ entry point.",2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
@IceMan1910 Looks like we are both wrong. Selling on any deadcat bounce and buyback when I see some insiders get some.,2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
"The market seems to be overreacting to me (down 13% as I write this). They had a slight miss on earnings, but they raised the dividend 10% and they continue to buy back stock. I think their long term prospects remain good. I added a little to my position today.",2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
"@Grant Beaty that is not how you analyze their debt.They have 5b in debt, but 2b in cash and account receivables. Usually these companies take 3/4 months to receive from their clients. So net, they have 3b in debt. In a normal year without intangibles depreciation they will do more than 1b in income.So, that is 3 years of net income to the debt, and another 3 for the market cap.",2024-09-26 00:00:00.000000
"C'mon guys, they're AI losers with $6B in debt. Their 2024 Operating income guidance minus interest payments is about $286M annually.Yes they're showing revenue growth, but that's almost entirely from the Webhelp acquisition, which was started at the of March, 2023! Management should have known better, given how long ChatGPT 3 had been available by then.I think this ice cube is going to melt way faster than it can pay off that debt. I'm short.",2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
@Whognu53 i might be wrong. But this is one of the wierder stock misprices in the market.I have a medium position.  Probably selling puts tomorrow.,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
An down 11% AH.  Of course.  Sales only up 46% to 2.4 billion. Can only hold this balloon under for so long. Waiting for the CC to jump in.  Must be missing something.  22 mil in SBC is crazy.,2024-09-25 00:00:00.000000
"@Grant Beaty It's a good point. I expected that as the quarters passed after the acquisition of Webhelp the leverage would be reduced, but net debt didn't decrease much either and this is very important in a company whose business model is being threatened (regardless if I don't think it will be replaced)",2024-09-15 00:00:00.000000
"At $4.925B the debt is the problem, in the face of increasing AI competition.At trailing 6 month net income, it would take almost 21 years to pay off!  At their peak trailing 12 month net income (May of 2022), it would take almost 11. Peak cash flows look a bit better, at 9 years.I agree AI is not going to get rid of these companies overnight. Mostly likely it will slowly supplant human operators, reducing their revenues. So it's tough to see CNXC's earnings remaining where they are in a few years, let alone decades.Their biggest sector is tech and electronics support, at 28% of revenues. A lot of this seems fairly easy to automate.",2024-09-11 00:00:00.000000
