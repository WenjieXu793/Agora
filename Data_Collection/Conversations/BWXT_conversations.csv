"@Robert F. Abbott Thank you, I took profits at 117, expect the current nuclear euphoria to wane in the next week or so (the small nuclear reactors are a 5 -10 year trend with more losers than winners along the way) but will buy back in under 100 if I get the chance, I believe BWXT will be a survivor and thriver as nuclear takes its place in the energy supply picture.",2024-10-05
"@William Frey Thanks, I'm surprised it hit the mark 11 months earlier than I expected. Looking ahead, I believe the earnings trend, backed up by the solid backlog, will continue to pull the price higher. And, you'll notice on the 10-year chart the price has climbed steadily, albeit with some minor dips along the way.",2024-10-03

"Well that makes perfect sense. Breaking ground on ""mobile ""Qualified oxymoron which also makes sense because the government is involved. One would have to assume they're paving a parking lot for 7 times the actual value with tax payer dollars of course. Should maybe have said ""greasing the axle "" on mobile""?",2024-09-24
"@Skagit if it is mobile, why don't they just take it with them ... ?or is this like a mobile home, where you tell people it's mobile and then pay monthly lot rent to UMH Properties (and by extension me!) for the rest of your life ...",2024-09-24
