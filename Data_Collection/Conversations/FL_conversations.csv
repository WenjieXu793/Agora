"@Bill the Bag Man I agree that Nike has a real potential. You're absolutely correct, Foot Locker has to earn each and every sale especially in an age when Amazon makes it so easy to shop at home. I think this is where the custom shoe lines come in. Offering a unique set of shoes should be a difference maker. A strategic investment and physical retail partnership with StockX for shoes would be another home run imo.",2024-09-28
"@Noah's Arc Capital Management Hello - I read your Nike piece submitted 9/20 a day after announcement of new CEO on 9/19. While I agree that partnerships with college athletes are a major source of potential revenue growth, they can be risky sometimes or may be beneficial only in the short term.  History has shown there are only so many Michael Jordan and LaBron James types that come along - a once every 2-3 generation type of personality and athlete and the contact payments to these athletic may be high. Bo Jackson way back in the day was another example. Under Armor and others could be savvy and be the one to find the next MJ etc All this being said, Nike to me is probably as cheap as it is gonna be (it will always have a slightly higher premium than market) and if purchased selectively on dips for me that is as far more attractive than footlocker as footlocker has to sell products and apparel that may be purchased anywhere else ( dicks sporting goods). Outlet malls around the country have stores that are exclusive to Adidas, Nike and Under Armor etc, making Footlocker not always the 1st 2nd or 3rd place to be for shoe purchases",2024-09-28
I sold FL at $31 in August 24â€™ to deploy cash elsewhere. Little to no OMNI presence physical mall presence is in decay. The turnaround thesis and risk reward is dicey. A partnership with Nike and Adidas means very little as ON and other brands take market share from Nike and A. In sum - no thanks. But appreciate the article.,2024-09-28
