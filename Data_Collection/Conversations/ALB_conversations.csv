"@CentralScrutinizer   It isn't China divesting, it's Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. News hit shares last week.Sorry my bad, I'm not in $PILBF at the moment so was relying on memory of a lot of stuff I read each day.",2024-10-06
SGML and PLL have to be considered as takeover possibilities,2024-10-05
"@Johnny Skyhook CATL sold their stake in pilbara years ago.   what do you mean ""China wants to divest from PILBF""?",2024-10-05
Makes me feel a little better as an alb bag holder even if they arenâ€™t the target,2024-10-05
"@CentralScrutinizer   Except now China wants to divest from $PILBF, not sure the rationale on that, just read the headline. However their (Pilbara's) move on $LRSRF in Brazil appears to be to gain exposure at less cost than their WA assets which are already low for the industry.",2024-10-04
"@Andy D.   I'm not sure, I've read $ALB in particular has a lot of costs built in, it has always been one I've avoided.  $ALTM is probably running on very weak margins but I'm not certain on that.  They did forestall developing a very high quality spodumene project recently, probably more about not depleting resources than about negative margins.",2024-10-04
@Andy D. i know that pilbara is profitable at current lithium prices.. decent gross margin too.,2024-10-04
@Johnny Skyhook What is the cost structure of these companies?At what lithium price do either of them become profitable or even breakeven?Thanks,2024-10-04
"Oops, looks like Arcadium was the target. That makes more sense than Albemarle which also has non-lithium divisions.",2024-10-04
@Johnny Skyhook why wouldnt RIO look at $PLS .. Rio has a large interest in Western Australia for other minerals.. would be a nice fit at around 10B or even more,2024-10-04
"@Gregory Holter Yes likely on this rumor, but we're also seeing more inflows to the space now, so maybe some of it will stick in the near term.Consolidation is the most likely when valuations are so steeply depressed as they are in the lithium world.  Both $ALB and $ALTM have had to mothball some production plans which isn't unexpected or even a bad thing, but supply did come off.  That puts a gigantic target on any public company (or enough of them), and there are many to choose from, depending on how the deal is structured.  As stand-alone assets of the two I don't like $ALB yet and do like $ALTM, others may disagree. Either had valid bull cases without the takeover rumors so it's hard to say, but I think Arcadium is the greater value by far, and it has Paul Graves which is good for shareholders I think.",2024-10-04
@Johnny Skyhook Both ALB and ALTM are making strong upward moves today.,2024-10-04
Losses expected for several quarters...next q has big write off as well loss over $7,2024-10-04
"UPDATE:For those following M&A I thought you might be interested to know some rumors circulating that $RIO is making good on its promise to expand into lithium, and is apparently ogling $ALTM and $ALB as possible buy ins given the dirt cheap valuations currently in this space. It makes me wonder what $VALE on the other side of the southern hemisphere might be up to with its own M&A plans, and a carve out JV with Manara for critical minerals.www.vale.com/...Follow the money.  Lithium will rise again.",2024-10-04
"@Andy D. I used IBM Thinkpads in the early 90's but went to a new employer who standardized on Dell laptops. Since having retired and switching to Linux I decided to go back to the Thinkpads (now Lenovo as you say) and bought a couple of refurbished T480 laptops (one as a spare) and love them. Driver and operating system support is superior to Dell  and there are plenty of replacement parts available, so hope to keep them going as long as I need them.",2024-09-27
"@nidneurons Probably because we all grew up with the GE brand name. They paid for the name.On the other hand, when they bought IBMs PC business, they renamed it Lenovo. I bought one recently for $280. I gave up on HP products (PCs and printers) which I had been using for years because of their lousy tech support.",2024-09-27
"@Johnny Skyhook Thanks for the article.SAIC/GM is the best performing China/Foreign partnership in the auto space.Instead of fighting the Chinese on EV manufacturing we should embrace their technology and perhaps set up a 50/50, GM/SAIC manufacturing subsidiary in the US.How many people know that GE Appliances is actually a Chinese company.",2024-09-27
Preferreds looking like a bargain. Might be the better choice,2024-09-24
"@0O0OO00 I stand corrected. Looks like they still lag lithium in terms of energy density though, but are cheaper and more environmentally friendly. Not sure if that's a tradeoff many would be willing to make considering that folks still have range anxiety (rational or not) with the higher density lithium batteries.Of course with the massive tarriffs on Chinese EVs and their technological lead in battery technology I wonder how long it will be for these to take off here in the U.S.",2024-09-24
"@CatchingFIRE Famously, sodium-ion batteries are already being manufactured and sold in the BYD Seagull and other Chinese models.www.carscoops.com/...www.electrive.com/...",2024-09-24
