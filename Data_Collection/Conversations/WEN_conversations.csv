"@Pedro Goulart Can they really afford this level of payout, isnâ€™t it over 100 percent of free cash flow? Just another Peltz milking.",2024-10-08 12:20:52.107587
"@TooEasy Yes, that's why I mentioned the level of debt. But the continued payment of these dividends in the long term will also depend on the developments of the new franchises.",2024-10-08 12:20:52.107587
@Pedro Goulart Didn't they borrow 500 million a couple years ago with no specific use for it?,2024-10-08 12:20:52.107587
"@113467 Basically, they're making business lighter. They have just sold restaurants previously operated by the company in New Zealand, increasing their footprint in Europe through various local operators and scaling back acquisitions in cases such as NPC Quality Burgers in 2021. With greater free cash flow and few investment opportunities within the United States, Wendy's prefers to distribute much of this to shareholders.

"Huge fan of this name. Hasn't done anything in forever but no, not a fan of MCD or BK in the alternative tho certainly would like to be a fan of the latter two. Not a fan of the current equity set in general at all long $us Treasuries across the entire yield curve now",2024-09-20 00:00:00.000000
"I am still in the market for Jack, but the valuation on WEN and their last earnings report was enough for me take a position. I think a dovish fed and a decent and growing economy with inflation falling, was what I needed. This is a long play for me, like you said. Patience, and that is also what Buffett said about The Market!",2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
"Simple trade of buying small manageable such as Wendy's as opposed to massive unwieldy such as McDonald's nothing against $mcd just that Wendy's has ""much further to run"" as it is so much smaller and just as well situated to provide food to a crisis wracked USA where everything is to be hyperinflated away.",2024-09-14 00:00:00.000000
