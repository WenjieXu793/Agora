Pharma is burdened by Medicare discussion. Prices are under pressure and actually it's not clear how much producers have to reduce prices.,2024-10-03
"@Jggouzd333 Wrong. I've been very active in LUMN discussions, which has recently risen 600%. A little better than the tech stocks that you pretend to own. I was also in on GME long before it became a meme because I saw what was coming in advance of the short squeeze. You can check my post history on that if you don't believe me. On the contrary, you seem tunnel visioned on VTRS - every single one of your comments is on this stock that you pretend not to care about. Hilarious!",2024-10-03
"@Oracle I judge myself on performance, and I vastly outperform the market over time - I'm at a 26% CAGR over the last decade. There are definitely periods of underperformance but that comes with value investing in an overheated market and focusing on turnaround plays which often take time, and longer than initially expected. At the end of the day the returns are more than worth it.",2024-10-03
Q3 is finished .  In 5 weeks only we have results. There is no earnings warning so results will be in line. The outlook on new medicines is most important.  They have to explain delays.One third of revenues is generics. This part should show solid growth and solid results.,2024-10-03
"@Jggouzd333 well, if their checks don't cash in, there is nothing to wait for at all.  I don't count other people's money; I focus on mine. It's more efficient for my own wealth.",2024-10-02
@HenryGood Never owned it and Never will. Never is a long time. You keep waiting while the exec's checks keep cashing.,2024-10-02
"@Jggouzd333 Lol, I've just been rewarded handsomely on LUMN which was left for dead by many. VTRS is far from my only play - I am well versed in turnaround stories and how long they often take to play out and while I don't hit 100% I definitely trounce the market on a consistent basis. Unlike you who comments on a single stock that you apparently don't own (nobody's buying that story). I'm sorry you're holding heavy VTRS bags but that was your decision and it has nothing to do with the future outlook of the company and stock, which is strong. Keep holding :)",2024-10-01
"@HenryGood If you Knew the stockmarket, it wouldn't be for an opined stance. Viatris appears to be your only tunnel vision thus missing many opportunistic boats that have since sailed way beyond Viatris' destination.",2024-09-28
@Jggouzd333 that's what we thought when the stock was at $15.,2024-09-28
@HenryGood you may have fared a bit better since you may have bought at the bottom but you still have lagged the market and the tech stocks .the numbers don’t lie and it’s very obvious that this was bad a deal for the shareholders.,2024-09-27
"@Jggouzd333 No - I simply know how the stock market works and know how to be patient to receive returns that vastly outperform the market. I recommend you stick to your amazing tech stocks which for some reason you've never commented on. My guess is you're a bitter bagholder of VTRS having bought way too high and have nothing to do now but whine and complain. That would explain why every single comment of yours is on VTRS which you pretend to not own or have any interest in. Actions speak louder than words :)I'm glad VTRS is still low because it allows the company to repurchase more shares, ensuring stronger future returns. I'm also glad because it allows me to accumulate a low risk, high reward company in a market where almost everything else is overvalued.",2024-09-27
"@Randol33 That HenryGood sure does substantiate the non-performing stock. Which leads us to ponder, we wonder if he can do the math? Must be a Viatris plant for investor procurement.",2024-09-27
"@Oracle Viatris will not wither that low. Pfizer, with denial of this concept, will not let Viatris go that low because they will feed them drugs coming off patent and Viatris will file a ANDA before others due to inside information. This flea ridden dog will just scour the neighborhood getting an economical meal here and there.",2024-09-27
"Any stock COULD deliver strong returns, VTRS however will not.",2024-09-25
"@Jggouzd333 If I did believe in those truths, I wouldn't be participating on this particular site or even investing to start with.",2024-09-23
@Oracle no one is making anyone to buy the stock.  If that's what most investors believe that this stock would tank.,2024-09-22
Seems development needs more time. We have to wait. Since my buy shares were up 12% and I received dividend.,2024-09-21
Huge drop on huge volume means no new products no growth for the foreseeable future .Without new blockbusters this will wither away to $4-$5 a share .,2024-09-20
Just look at those strong returns going to work today.#2 biggest loser in the entire index today. Great job VTRS,2024-09-20
"@Jggouzd333 You have every right to comment on a stock you seemingly have no interest in. It's just a complete waste of time, that's all.",2024-09-19
