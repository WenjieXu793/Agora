cta.prb/pff pair has seen cta.prb underperform since june 2021.. going back to inception in march 2006 it went from 1.5 sigma rich from 8/19 to 8/21 to all time low and near 3 sigma cheap in october 2023 to its current level from near 1.5 sigma cheap so plenty of room for outperformance to continue,2024-09-30
"CTVA has a legacy PFAS-liability cost sharing agreement with DD and CC.  It´s complicated, but CTVA´s obligation is based on percentages (never greater than 25%) but capped at $640 million, with DD capped at $1.36 billion and CC having unlimited liability.  So CTVA´s maximum liability is ring-fenced, at least unless DD and/or CC were to go bankrupt.   So CTVA has some protections in place limiting its exposure to PFAS claims, unlike MMM, for example.",2024-09-18
"Appreciate the work on Corteva, but this is a lawsuit dartboard, ala MMM, JNJ, et al. The FTC is likely to continue slamming away at these guys to get a billion here a few more billion in damages there. It's also a favorite object of the pumper dumpers on little Timmy's lost sheep group.",2024-09-18

"With rate cuts coming, this is a capital gains investment versus income. A 25% to 30% increase is very likely during this period. Good Luck",2024-09-16
@mt57 Please verify your first ticker as I didn’t find it.  Thanks,2024-09-16
NOFD has reeaally poor distribution coverage. I’d avoid unless short-term rates collapse.  PFXF is a better balance of risk & return.,2024-09-16
