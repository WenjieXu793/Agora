@LenceFlatu you are right there. In my opinion the lack of options for refining around the globe will further support the US as a large oil refiner. And MPC could benefit from it in the long run - as long as it continues to inject capex to improve its assets.,2024-10-01
"Libya shutting down has been a disaster for the refining Industry 2024 but maybe that ends in 2025 hard to tell. There are no oil Refineries left in Russia so that should help the Industry but the biggest problems remains truly poor retail operations that are decrepit, aged, not well run and now forced to compete with the likes of Buccees and WaWa. Long $bj BJs Wholesale strong buy as they sell both fuel and tire changes. Propane is not marketed well at all in North America by US refiners either despite stunning amounts of exports that only drive US consumers away from this very valuable product. Don't even get me started on kerosene and even moar valuable energy product. Long $rklb RocketLab strong buy",2024-09-28
"@Vaalue and @IL Cricket totally agree that timing is important and better to buy low than high--and FWIW MPC stock price is 9% higher than at last review. The a) 2% dividend, b) important concerns about growth projects and profitability, c) higher WCS price (MPC has benefited from relatively low WCS feedstock costs) now that WCS has better access to Asian markets and d) ability to continue sustaining buybacks (mkt cap being chipped away now) as a way to juice the stock price anchor my concerns. Of course, the MPLX $550 MM/quarter return to MPC is a less well-known benefit. I am not evaluating MPLX in this article (it is a partnership, benefits depend on individual's tax situation) but investors may want to evaluate it separately on their own. (And as I said, I own MPC stock.) Further, do note as others have, that if Trump is elected and companies choose to/are able to produce more oil domestically, the oil price could drop, benefiting MPC, other refiners, and consumers generally.",2024-09-26
"@IL Cricket Agree---when MPC was above $200, all the analysts screamed ""buy""---that's when I sold!!!......Now that many analysts are downgrading MPC now that its price is low,  I am ready to re-consider buying again soon----the way to make money and play the game successfully is to have the courage and conviction to buy when everyone and his brother ""hates"" the company, particularly ""solid companies that are cyclical""...   Temporary weakness in a good company is a great time to buy for a longer-term patient investor...Just my 2-cents worth, but over 40 years of investing,  this philosophy has served me well.....",2024-09-26
"Fine analysis -- but the time to buy the stock is when the crack spreads are tight (low), which seems to be now.  They handle the cyclicality of the business very well -- personally full (very full) on MPLX and MPC, and I have every confidence they'll manage through this as well.  Truly a SWAN, if you can ignore the inherent volatility of a commodity-based business.",2024-09-26
"@Akim Guerreiro no , am looking for refinery metrics.e.g., what is their record for maintenance over-runs?normalized 3,5,10 years margins per barrel  (excluding SG&A)?are they better operators per age and complexity score of refinery?etc....",2024-09-18
@translate I am note sure I understand. Could you please specify your question? Are you referring to the earnings estimates for the next years of Marathon?,2024-09-18
"@Akim Guerreiro how do the metrics look for 3,5,10 yrs?have you looked at some long-term refinery specific metrics, normalized for refinery age?",2024-09-17
"@1sinedo wow, that's the best kind of feedback one could read. Good job holding since over 30 years! I am sure you are more than happy with your investment.",2024-09-17
"Thanks for the update. I have been disappointed with MPC's dividend, and you enlightened me on their buy-backs.  Now, I feel smart for holding it since 1991.",2024-09-17
Is is finally buy? Soft landing looks possible if the Fed cuts rates quickly enough.,2024-09-16
Looks like the only thing MPC is driving is the share price down. Already given up 90% of the gains for the year. With no support found yet and still selling at high % daily.,2024-09-11
