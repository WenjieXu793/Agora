So I thought the CFO made an unforced error in how he discussed the weakening of the consumer credit environment...seemed off-handed rather than planned.  So I said to myself...why not try and catch the falling knife?  Well I did and so far the best I can say is that I didn't lose money...yet...up one dollar.,2024-09-23 00:00:00.000000
"@darnoc111 Of all the insurance I have paid for through the years, it turns out one of my best moves was a home care policy. But it still only covers about half the expense.",2024-09-17 00:00:00.000000
"@darnoc111 I am currently having to do RMDs. But, my medical expenses for my wife's care greatly reduce my taxable income, so I still concentrate on growth and income together in my IRA. I also have a ROTH that is mainly my income backup, with several REITs and oil stocks. I agree that the more of our money we get to keep out of the hands of the government, the better.",2024-09-17 00:00:00.000000
"@ransim7222 Spending under Harris will grow, but to pay for it taxes will be raised. This is one reason to move away from federal taxable income. Another is that I have waited years to get back into muni-bonds since interest rates have not been much above 1% for a long time. I do not know if rates will go a lot lower or if inflation will rise so much that forces rates even higher. I really want to not have to watch the market as much as I do since I have more than I need, and I want to be able to relax more.",2024-09-17 00:00:00.000000
"@darnoc111 I mostly agree. But I have noticed the market loves government spending, and that promises to increase significantly under a Harris administration.",2024-09-17 00:00:00.000000
@darnoc111 Same here. I moved 50% to municipal bonds. The federal tax exemption will still be there no matter what happens to the tax rate expirations in 2025.,2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
"@Insouciant Investor I have moved a lot of money into Muni-bonds AA/ AAA for the same reason, about 40% of my portfolio. Doing this actually increased my income, and I made a ton of money on stocks I sold and had to sell some stocks to pay the taxes. Next year if Kamala is in office taxes will be much higher and the market will be hard pressed to go higher and, in my opinion, will go much lower.",2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
"I don't see how we don't go into a recession, maybe even a hard landing. There is a lot of bad data out there. Also stocks are very expensive. Even defensive sectors like SCHD now have a P/E of 17.50. The S&P 500 is almost at a 30 P/E.I have shifted half of my portfolio to bonds and may move more.",2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000

"I'm shocked - shocked - to find that delinquencies on an average credit card rate of 20.78% are *increasing*. Who would have ever surmised such a thing? It's horrifying, scandalous!",2024-09-16 00:00:00.000000
@Nathan Buehler just the separation between the rich and the poor we’ve seen in other stocks. Costo and rh are booming while dltr and dg are suffering. Here’s two things they don’t mention1) there’s a lot more poor people than rich2) the rich can easily become poor while it’s harder for thr poor to become rich. Tech bros can tell you that,2024-09-15 00:00:00.000000
"@Chris Bee yes, I'd like to clarify. I was in the market for a car between 22-23 and my experience was encountered by people still paying mark-up prices on vehicles from dealerships still having low inventories. What they were paying were high interest rate loans. I ended up waiting and got a car once supply was replenished for approx 5k off sticker back in April. I remember back in 22-23 even some of my co-workers were still all googly eyed for cars and buying cars marked up several thousand dollars. I thought it was dumb. No surprise they're having problems with their loans.",2024-09-15 00:00:00.000000
Nothing will get better for the majority of americans until real progress is made in improving the cost of living. Neither political party has put forth the kind of substantial policies needed to make this change happen. expect continued stagflation and a diverging economy,2024-09-15 00:00:00.000000
"Notice how these comments are mainly coming from the subprime lenders. Most of the GSIB banks have been tightening credit standards for over 2 years now. Some reported auto loans performing better than expected and going down. The lower income part of the economy continues to struggle while the middle and upper class are doing well. These headlines are attention grabbers but don't fully explain current conditions, and additionally do not speak for all banks and how they are seeing credit play out.",2024-09-15 00:00:00.000000
"@Yanks56 true, TLT is very high ownership. We are anticipating that with over 30T in debt rates would have to come down ASAP. I’m trimming the long bonds move shorter, probably?",2024-09-15 00:00:00.000000
