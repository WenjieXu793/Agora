@Rida Morwa The J's are paying .6354 per quarter or $2.54/year--at least that's what I just got paid and what Seeking Alpha shows. Do these reset or just yield much higher than what you stated in the article?,2024-09-28
"The only lesson learned from 2008 is that bubbles need to be even bigger so yes easy to understand the push back against consolidation lest everyone jump aboard the whole *""Intel the entire US economy!""* craziness. Short $gs Goldman Sachs strong sell. *SOMETHING* needs to be done about New York City Community Bank. Force Goldman Sachs to buy that is my solution and *MAKE* GS become a Bank. The whole reason to create the mania in the first instance is to make a fortune in the ensuing bust. Banks don't do that $gs does that. Long $wec Wisconsin Energy strong buy. One way to solve the so called ""electricity crisis that can only be solved by nuclear power"" is to use a brand new coal fired solution not that Pennsylvania would ever try that of course. Long $mdu strong buy that one supports the local economy big time.",2024-09-26
This administration is doing everything they can to prevent corporate mergers. One problem with this is how they going to get those higher taxes from corporations if they prevent them from making money.,2024-09-17
My only surprise is that there was nothing in there about the impact of bank mergers on climate change.Yellen yaps about the role of climate change in Treasury decisions all the time...,2024-09-17
"Short the banks. With this new rule, and the rule for increased reserve requirements, in addition to the massive upside-down portfolios the banks hold in bonds and real estate, there is a major downside brewing up in the banking sector.",2024-09-17
"MTB should be beneficiary of earnings growth and multiple re-rating. NIM will inflect positively in ensuing quarters, driven by Fed rate cuts and deployment of excess liquidity to pay down high cost funding sources.  Buybacks are set to ramp higher in 2025. MTB trades in line with peers at 10x 2025E EPS, and should re-rate higher as these tailwinds come into greater focus. MTB's excess capital, liquidity, and strong underwriting all make it more resilient than peers, meriting a premium multiple.Bottom Line:  Stay long.",2024-09-13
"@2021investor Lower Mortgage rates will lead to refinancing at lower rates, devaluing mortgages via higher CPR, and leading to lower interest components. If you think service fees will salvage the lost value, then go ahead. The only thing going for banks in a declining-rate environment is 1) IBD, and 2) Lower funding cost + higher credit spread on loan book, but credit event risk is usually higher when rates first start dropping, so, that's why you're seeing banks reduce duration on loans (lower returns), I use $MS as an example.",2024-09-13
"@Pearl Gray Equity and Research Why not? Nobody's taking out mortgages right now. With lower rates, the floodgates will open again.",2024-09-12
"@MileHighMoney30 It's both. ""The market"" is a lot of different people doing different things. Sometimes the things they do has a common theme. However, news articles talk about ""the market"" as if it's one individual. Trying to understand the psychology of ""the market"" is like trying to understand what direction an army of ants will scatter. Depending on the environment, incentives, and stimulus, it can be all sorts of things.Some people are expecting 25bps, others are expecting 50bps, some changed their minds given X or Y news. On balance, the net change is reflected in the market. Zoomed out, it looks ""random"" to a series of economists and other academics. When it finally happens next week, the immediate result will be corrected towards what actually happens. But the overall long-term result ""should"" be that the economy improves with rate cuts, depending on how severe the economy was damaged with the rate hikes.That's my take at least from a random guy on the internet.",2024-09-11
@MileHighMoney30 Rate cuts are good for banks looking to grow their loan books.,2024-09-11
"Im confused, I thought a larger rate cut meant the economy was struggling more than we would like but now a smaller rate cut is bad? Which is it?!",2024-09-11
This is the start of possibly a very dramatic easing cycle so hardly bad news for Banks as credit becomes more widely available and as there be no shortage of Government need to borrow let alone all of the massive industries currently running flat out to meet demand and still hardly immaterial inflation even Banks should make money here. Long $f Ford Motor Company strong buy,2024-09-11
Banks were down previously because a 50 bsp cut was on the table. Letâ€™s pick whatever nonsense headline fits our narrative today. NII is the story this week with JPM cooling expectations. This has overshadowed banks who made positive remarks and reaffirmed guidance. Place your bets accordingly.,2024-09-11
Why is a lower rate bad for banks. High rates set off tge crises for regional banks.,2024-09-10
