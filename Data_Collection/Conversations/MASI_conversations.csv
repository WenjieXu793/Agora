"@mateoshaffer Thanks for having a read! I didn't go as far back because I wanted to look at what's been happening for an update. In my previous coverage, I saw that margins were indeed healthier. It'll be interesting to see how they will go about improving going forward. The drama isn't over yet I'm sure so I'll keep an eye out for any more developments.",2024-09-25
"@Gytis Zizys you're not looking back far enough in your analysis. Historically, Masimo has had very good ROE and margins. The company went through two events at ounce: 1. Kiani purchased Sound United - for what appears to be a side project but a very awful idea for their core business. 2. The company went through what many other companies went through - the dreaded post-covid trough. Out of the supply chain shock hospitals over-ordered Masimo products and it took quite some time for them to burn through their inventory. The play here is a margin recovery to pre-covid norms once the normal cycle fully returns. A spin-off of their consumer business would help - it's a very diluted market and I personally love Garmin. There's a niche roll for some of it's medical consumer products for out pt. monitoring but not large like it's hospital line, in my opinion. Part of me feels bad for Kiani - this is a company he built and founded. But in the last couple of years he asn't acted the best in shareholder interest and his actions/responses to shareholder concerns since the Sound acquisition made him seem a bit toddler-like.",2024-09-25

Apple will just wait until September 2028 to announce that blood oxygen meters are back in new Apple Watches after Masimo's patent expires in August 2028. I doubt the Android Watch market will make much inroads in the next 4 years. They haven't in the last 9.,2024-09-15
Management is throwing whatever they can at the wall to try to beat the proxy battle they're contending with.,2024-09-15
"@Blowback2 Yes. I believe that the much of Masimo functionality will soon become a feature on the Apple watch, enhanced to perfection by AI. AI will also gather all the patient data, format it in the way FDA likes to see it and present it to the FDA for approval while Apple guys play golf. Not an enviable fate but wouldn't be the first time.",2024-09-14
Apple owns the watch market. Period. But you’re allowed to gamble with OPM…. (Which is how it’s done….!).,2024-09-14
Masimo's entire consumer business is at risk of being casually mentioned as an Apple watch feature.,2024-09-10
