"You said it yourself in the title, LULU is a quality business. LULU management recognizes their previous missteps and will learn from them. The stock has been beaten down the last year, now's the time to buy. Fed is cutting rates and consumers will have more cash to spend as unemployment lowers and more jobs get posted. 2025 is posed to be year of growth. LULU will benefit. So many SA analysts are so narrow minded, and only think of the stock movement the next 3-6 months. This is exactly why people lose money (including me- in the past). LULU has strong fundamentals, and has a long history of EPS beats. Warren Buffett's quote, ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful"" can make you a lot of money IF you learn to have patience.",2024-10-04

Strong day today. Cup and handle breakout unfolding.  Needs to hold this breakout pattern into the close.Long.,2024-09-27
If Lulu can convince the market that they can defend their moat in this hyper competitive market this stock will rocket up. I’m optimistic management will bring more “newness” soon.,2024-09-26

"@ChristianDe Hey, appreciate you post. I, too, agree it's a quality brand, and recently bought some shares. But I am wondering how much the brand Alo may impact its continued growth. Am starting to see that brand a lot more in my travels.",2024-09-19
"Declining demographics, and exploding consumer DEBT has hand cuffed China’s economy….The number of “babies born” in China has fallen off a cliff and the spike in Boomer retirements continues sink China’s future growth and prosperity….China’s consumer have pulled back their spending due to large DEBT accumulation….The U.S. economy is facing the same crisis, as the birth / death rates accelerate towards a declining population as well….since 2010 to present…72 Million Millennials have little hope of household formation, as home are unaffordable and huge students loan debt doesn’t help matters..$$$The US population should be cut in half by 2085 ….as India becomes an economic global powerhouses ….imho ??",2024-09-15

"Does Barry the ceo of PSEC have to buy more shares every single day???? He was rude to the shareolders at the Conf call and even though the news was good - he gave many shareholders attitude.  I can whine cause i bought a bunch at $4.75-85 but I planned on buying even more.  Everytime I set a price Barry comes in and buys more and literally millions.  This guy is something else, not sure I've seen anything like it in over 50 years of investing.  I'd love to be able to call him and ask if he plans to stop but I over-react to rude people.",2024-09-12
"@John Naccarelli Fair value is a 15 PE for most stocks that grow at 8% CAGR yearly, so why do you guys think that this stock deserves to trade for less than a 15 PE? It’s almost at a 15 PE now…Buy high sell low?",2024-09-09
