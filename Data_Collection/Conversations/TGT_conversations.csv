"@michaeldamian Thanks for reading, TGT's likely a good bet for decent returns from here. I'm looking for greater return potential than that in individual stocks right now.",2024-10-03
Government has warned them about deceptive promises about climate benefits as well as a couple other companies  Seems a lot of actions against USA companies these daysMaybe watch them a bit?JMHO,2024-09-29
"You are right Amrita in that this holiday season will be critical for Target as food and rent prices keep a ceiling on the amount of money left for discretionary spend.  TGT saw its best days when people had stimulus money and many of their competitors fell off the radar during COVD.  Over 60% of Walmart's sales are now essential food items and they are priced lower than anyone but Aldi.  That is their draw..... what brings people into the store where they do buy what discretionary they can afford.  TGT does not have that draw that makes them a destination and you see consumers like stupidguy2023 drifting away.I am also finding better stores conditions, in-stocks and service levels higher at Walmart than TGT.  That would have been unimaginable twenty yeas ago.",2024-09-26
"Ah yes, best to wait until Target is back down to $100 or $80 instead of $155. THEN you can buy. Just ignore the strong value/profitability/momentum ratings on SA ... wait for major retail weakness to plunge TGT down to $75, then buy maybe just 2,000 worth (don't want too much on this risky stock). LOL",2024-09-26
"AMZN, COST, KR, TJX, and WMT seem to be safer investments than TGT.",2024-09-25
@El Rainmaker Adding down here at the lows will be very profitable very soon……JMHO,2024-09-24
"Curious how you feel TGT stacks up against WMT, COST, TJX, JWN, KSS, M etal, ie is there a rising tide for all boats?",2024-09-23
@Amrita Roy I buy from Amazon. The local grocery store. The smaller daily stuff I buy from Walgreens... which is right across the street from Target.,2024-09-23
"@Atlas332 I agree. But the current pessimism may be looking overdone. They are following in Walmart footsteps with their Circle Rewards membership program sort of like Sams Club does. For now over a three year period I think TGT holds some promise. I have to admit- Ill need to see more evidence of progress to go even longer on TGT, over and above the 3 yr horizon.",2024-09-23
Stopped shoping at Target 1-2 years ago although I live less than a mile away from one. Used to go almost on a weekly basis.,2024-09-23
You are going against the grain here Amrita.  Are you long TGT?  Most analysts and myself see a dimmer picture as WMT and COST continue to take share.   TGT is losing their ability to differentiate and store service and in-stocks is sorely lacking in many areas across the country as they struggle to find help.  Why they are now offering $24/hour starting pay which will impact their operating margins heavily if those sales do not come.........,2024-09-23
Long CELH. It will be a longtime winner. Pep should buy it but I don’t see that happening.,2024-09-21

Waiting for Celsius drink to reach Singapore to try it and compare with Monster and Red Bull,2024-09-20
"I agree, TGT is a solid buy here.  Should grow earnings and dividend in high single digits (circa 8%) for years to come.",2024-09-20
"A couple months back we were driving out to Palm Springs and stopped at the Target located in Moreno Valley… it had underwent renovations, grocery expansion, new Starbucks installed, and a new ULTA area….  I was very impressed with the whole layout and experience and the employees were all very nice…. If Target keeps replicating that shopping destination experience, I think they have a juggernaut on their hands.",2024-09-20
"Good analysis, but here's the thing, Target invented a niche for itself as a combination of value and style and was very successful with it for decades, but now seems to have lost their way.  They had their Canadian fiasco, but that was apparently operational.  This is more strategic marketing.  Now they are more of a utility and less of a destination.  Still a little more pleasant to visit than Walmart but with poorer selection and higher prices.  And then there's the woke element.  They were impacted along with everyone during the COVID supply chain problems, but worse than most.  Now that's over, and if anything the supply chain is working in their favor now.  They spent a couple of years hunkered down with terrible choices in apparel, but at least on the men's side that seems to be improving.  They've never made a dime selling groceries, always been there as a traffic-builder not really a profit center - in their glory days they did not carry groceries at all.  They started their small urban locations to use as shipping and fulfilment centers also, and this seemed to be working for a year or two pre-COVID, but I'm not sure if that's still winning or not - especially with the ""shrinkage"" problems in California and other states.  I always liked the stores as a customer and have owned some stock for many years now, but I don't know that I would recommend it now except as a proxy for the overall economy and market, for which you might as well buy SPY or other index funds.  If TGT could rediscover their mojo there might be some price growth, but what are the odds?",2024-09-20
Already mentioned in my disclosure I'm long TGT. I added some today on the dip. Both are in my IRA and I intend to hold them long-term.,2024-09-20
"I noticed Celsius is out selling other products, popular with young women and health conscious people Celsius is a buy",2024-09-19
"TGT is a bargain right now and, yes, Lee would be smart to build out Target's own brands. That's the simplest road to higher margins.",2024-09-19
