@MySami it will be greatly reduced if Pooh decides to invade Taiwan. I think Putins disaster in Ukraine is giving him second thoughts.,2024-10-05
@123semi It's not in Putin's interest for him to unilaterally pull out of the Ukraine at this time..The West will have to offer Putin a plausible off ramp dealthat will allow Putin a reason to quit fighting.Putin has control of approx 20% of the Ukraine land mass.Most of it he has controlled since 2014.  Perhaps the best time to have seriously negotiated with Putin would have been 8 years ago...? As it stands now its absolutely fantasy to think Putin willexit the whole of Ukraine without Zelensky giving up someterritory to get a deal done.,2024-10-05

Long $ba Boeing strong buy despite the strike. Joe Biden still remains the worst human being ever to have existed in the meantime. Good luck Israel!

"''Yes, the way mankind is going, best to be overweight Cyber tech, and F-35s/Missiles.''Yep, there are some very bad people in positions of concentrated power who are funding endless wars and arming others nations / groups to fight.
