It’s a great company and if the price gets significantly below the margin of safety it could be a good long term holding and dividend  payer.,2024-09-28
"@josephaoppenheim ""With 10 year Treasuries yielding 3.8%, I prefer what is called an equity bond yielding 3.6%."" On a stock that has a long term down trend, where you end up with unrealized capital losses? My dry powder is held in a money fund at Schwab, called SWVXX, It earned 5.11% until the Fed dropped 50 basis points. Now it earns 4.74%. I'm all for a stock that earns a fair to good dividend yield, as long as the stock price grows a little bit. But why choose something that has a falling share price? Don't tell me, ""Technicals, shmechnicals, I look at fundamentals."", because you bought at a low price. $31.30 avg. Clearly you are looking at more than just fundamentals. You didn't buy HRL at a higher price when you had the chance, a few months ago. It was as high as $36.86, in May. Then it dropped like a rock. The trend is your friend, unless you choose to ignore the trend.",2024-09-27
"@Make good choices Technicals, shmechnicals, I look at fundamentals.At the time of GLP1 weight loss drugs, HRL is basically a protein stock, meat and plant, including snacks, the recent Planters purchase fitting perfectly.And, it goes ex dividend in mid October and will likely announce a small dividend increase in November.With 10 year Treasuries yielding 3.8%, I prefer what is called an equity bond yielding 3.6%.",2024-09-27
"@josephaoppenheim My concern, is that the stock chart shows there has been lower lows, and lower highs, since it had an all time high of $55.11 on April 18, 2022. There are people who bought shares at the high, on April, 2022. That is a loss of value, 42.35% in two and a half years. The dividends do not come close to covering that loss in capital. Maybe you will do better than them, considering you bought in, at October 2017 prices.",2024-09-27
"I’ve recently started a relatively small position in HRL, average cost 31.3.I suspect there will be some tax loss selling by year end, in fact, it might have already started.I love Dividend King consumer staple stocks when most don’t want them.",2024-09-27
"I’ve been recently building a position in HRL So far just a small position in my portfolio at cost of 31.34, but hope to add more before it goes ex dividend.",2024-09-24
