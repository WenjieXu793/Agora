"@Analyzzzzzzt Can you help, please? I analyse Delta Plus for options trading and think maybe do same with MSA Safety but something I do not understand. From Delta Plus February press release ""The Group recorded a positive organic growth of +14% in 2023, in line with previous publications. Excluding the impact of hyperinflation in Argentina, organic growth stood at +1.9% in 2023 (+€7.9m)."" Does MSA Safety not have this effect? I do not read about it in MSA Safety materials. Effect is very large, no?",2024-09-06
"@Tequila06000 MSA Safety is a prominent player in the safety industry, but has faced some challenges that have impacted its revenue growth. While the company reported positive revenue and earnings growth in recent quarters, the pace of this growth appears to be stalling compared to earlier expectations.For the second quarter of 2024, MSA Safety reported a revenue increase of 3.4% year-over-year, reaching $462.5 million. However, this growth was slower than previous quarters, and the company’s earnings per share (EPS) missed analyst expectations. The company’s revenue growth forecast for the next two years is about 4.6% annually, which is below the industry average of 6.6%  .Several factors are contributing to this slowdown. First, MSA’s growth in specific segments, such as detection products, has been underwhelming, with some areas even seeing declines when adjusted for currency impacts. The company has also been dealing with challenges related to foreign exchange rates and restructuring costs, which have put additional pressure on their margins .The slower revenue growth and recent earnings misses indicate that the company is navigating through a period of uncertainty, which has caused some concern among investors and analysts . Be sure to do your homework on the  fundamentals before investing in any stock.",2024-09-03
