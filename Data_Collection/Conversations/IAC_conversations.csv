"I agree with @analyst1982 and @rgtichy Your SOTP approach made $1.2bn in debt at Dotdash Meredith disappear. Properly incorporating the DDM net debt reduces your SOTP by around $14/shr. So it should be $85/shr in SOTP value, and if you apply your 30% HoldCo discount, then fair value is $59.5/shr, implying only 15% upside. To provide more detail, you valued it using a 7x EV/EBITDA multiple on $290m in EBITDA, so you got an EV of roughly $2.0bn. You put this $2.0bn in the SOTP, which effectively ignores $1.2bn in DDM net debt, massively overstated IAC's equity holding of DDM.",2024-10-05
