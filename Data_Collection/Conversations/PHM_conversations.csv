"Read the Lennar earnings call to find out what's really going on. Even now, housing starts are too low for current demand, what to say of the accumulated shortage. Mortage rates are dropping which will increase demand. Lower backlogs simply reflect high mortgage rates in the past.",2024-09-20
"Believe that your failure to properly understand what PLM is doing, makes your assessment completely wrong. You said “The bulk of its positive cash flows has gone into new projects” and I can attest that is certainly true in my area. They have 3-4 major developments that are in various phases of development. These upfront costs are immense. After that, they start building sections according to demand.

@dlevine007 I see rates getting that low too although I'm not sure there will be much of a move lower in the overall housing market.  As rates drop more buyers will come into the market and those buyers include foreign and corporate as well.,2024-09-11
