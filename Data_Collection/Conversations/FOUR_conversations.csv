"@zakuky My fear has been that payments is a highly competitive space and hence growth will soon moderate. I am assuming restaurant payments are highly penetrated already. However, new verticals and international should provide growth.",2024-10-01
@Pineapple_Paul theyve been nothing but a black eye to investors LOL,2024-09-19

"@Invest4Wealth You need to do a lot more studying before making these comments.  You're gonna cost yourself a lot of money thinking you know it all, when you don't know anything.",2024-09-14
"I was originally afraid of all those acquisitions as well, but not anymore. Revel acquisition is a win-win, let me explain why: Complete change of business model! Shift4's acquisition of Revel is a strategic move designed to overhaul Revel’s original business model, which primarily focused on offering cloud-based, iPad-centric POS solutions for restaurants and retail businesses. Revel's model relied on software subscription fees and hardware sales, but it allowed third-party payment processors!!, limiting its potential for high-margin revenue. Shift4 plans to transform this by fully integrating its own SkyTab POS system, replacing Revel’s hardware and software. This transition will give Shift4 full control over both the POS infrastructure and payment processing!!, ensuring they capture revenue from every transaction processed.Additionally, Shift4’s strategy involves eliminating one-time revenue streams from hardware sales and instead pushing for recurring revenue via bundled payment services and SaaS subscriptions. By shifting Revel’s customers onto their end-to-end payment processing platform, Shift4 significantly increases its profit margins, making each transaction more lucrative. This approach also allows Shift4 to better cross-sell its other services like business intelligence and loyalty programs.Revel’s existing customer base, particularly in the restaurant and quick-service sectors, provides Shift4 a robust opportunity for growth, especially with enterprise clients. The acquisition will also help Shift4 expand globally, as Revel has an international presence. Ultimately, Shift4 aims to replace all aspects of Revel’s original business, leveraging its own integrated solution for higher margins, scalability, and a more cohesive customer experience.",2024-09-14
"@swarfer Did live through that and it was impressive.  Graduate in engineering in '73.  High point was buying a Craig hand held calculator that did arithmatic and had one function, $300....a lot of money in the early 70's.  TI 30, multi function, came out a few years later under $100....a real hand held scientific calculator.""It's not lost on us that, you know, it might be 10 iterations from now and a bunch of evolutions of the suit, but that, someday, someone could be wearing a version of [it] that might be walking on Mars,""Wait 'till Starship gets settled in then we should start having fun!",2024-09-14
"@vooch To date, and scheduled, there are probably upward of 50-100 individual Spacex customers . Go to the link below and scroll down a ways for a detailed description of each launch and results:en.wikipedia.org/...Also includes future launches.To Date 383 Launches, 347 Landings, 316 ReflightsOr we could continue to depend on the Russians for launches and engines.",2024-09-14
@Purewater Based on your response I suspect BA stranding astronauts in space and NASA relying on Russian rockets to get into space is a win in your book. ,2024-09-14
"@Duncan20903 Ok I am looking and this is what I see today posted by RKLB.  I believe private enterprise is the future of space, not governments: We’re just three days away from the launch of our next mission for @KineisIoT! Our 53rd Electron launch will carry five satellites to low Earth orbit (LEO) as part of the second of five dedicated missions to build out Kineis' entire constellation of IoT satellites.",2024-09-13
"NASA’s Gemini 4 did that way back in June 3rd, 1965 with probably no more than 64K computer memory, maybe less. If you didn’t live thru it, you probably can’t imagine how it was done before gigabytes, smartphones and the internet. Either way good work.",2024-09-13
"@vooch Not all gov't. Here is a list of Rocket Lab's 52 launches and it shows the customer.  It's a nice mix of gov't and private corporations. This is the company to invest in if you want space exposure. They do launches, software, build vehicles, etc and are going to send up their own constellation ala Starlink once their next-gen Neutron rocket is flying next year. And Peter Beck is some kind of super genius.en.wikipedia.org/...",2024-09-13
@vooch as of right now yes but the future is corporations. As china starts to dominate space the us govt has no choice but to liberalize space like they did with spacex. Space in the future is going to be what flying planes is today,2024-09-13
It would be better to focus on shiftfour on organic growth . There were short report released 2 years ago on four buying on growth . But lowering rate and the acceleration of seasonal sales should help them much,2024-09-13
"@vooch hey vooch. I see that you have a stake in SLDP, so do I. If you are not into the space economy, I would urge you to take a look at RKLB. You have to be long but reward will be there. I was in at $2.1 in ASTS before I freaked out and sold at between $15 and $35. But it is another game changer. In my opinion.",2024-09-12
"@vooch depends 1) rocket launches for satellites - Govts + corporations2) private launches - rich people 3) manned rocket launches for NASA - Govt4) space internet think starlink - Govt, corporations, regular people 5) rocket launches for scientific purposes - NASA, corporations, colleges 6) space semiconductor manufacturing + medicinal manufacturing - corporations 7) in the future space mining + colonization - Govts, corporations, rich folks  we are on the cusp of the second space race. Or we could completely ignore it and let china do whatever they want",2024-09-12
Next SpaceX needs to reimagine the MMU (Maned Maneuvering Unit).,2024-09-12
@Barbell Investment Ideas maybe SPIR will also - at some point in the future - find its time to shine ... who knows,2024-09-12
$ASTS is the most consequential news. Thier Satelites will connect 2.5 billion unconnected people by 2026,2024-09-12
SpaceX is the only viable company in this arena. Nasa & BA are space dogs.,2024-09-12
