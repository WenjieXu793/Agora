I’ve been buying for the last year and gonna keep buying with the latest dip. I think Matt runs a good company and it’s only a matter of time when this takes off.,2024-10-06
"@bqdoo It will definitely bounce back above $8 and $9, considering expanding my position further as well!",2024-10-05
"@InvestorMan Sr. Definitely oversold as always, heavy insider sell really kicked it off (again as usual)",2024-10-05
"@sho1 MSRs are secondary to the businesses bottom line. Refinancing will dominate the revenue/bottom line for the next few years as we saw in 2020 and 2021. The earnings report explains in more detail how the MSRs affect the business and why it’s not a concern, just part of the cycle of interest rates. Looking at the books it’s apparent the MSRs are not what drives the company’s performance either.",2024-10-05
"If interest rate goes down, good for business, but bad for MSR markdown, so final bottom line could be neutral.If interest rate goes up, bad for business, no MSR markdown, bad for bottom line.Then, no matter what it is only bad for the bottom line. I must be wrong here. Any comment? help?",2024-10-05

"Outstanding is 94M5+15M8  = 110M ? (Class B, C not issued) so Class D has about 1.5B shares issue, that confused me, so we have 1.61B shares x $7.5 = MC of $12B, so it is right, Mat owns > 90% ... Another SPAC problem?",2024-10-04
@InvestorMan Sr. I added as well.  Sure it may be a bit early but do I allows you to wait and it is now quite a bit off it’s high and rates are down and likely go lower but maybe more slowly.,2024-10-04
"@InvestorMan Sr. Some news described the mortgage industry (not UWMC) is not out of the wood yet. House transaction is still low because seller holding 3% mortgage is waiting for rate to drop further (perhaps 1-2 years) in order for volumes to pick up. Same for refi business. It could be a false start, I will be watching a while before jumping in.",2024-10-04
Mortgage rates inched up today after the jobs report. UWMC just touched it's 200 dma. Oversold by several metrics. I have a lot already but I just added some more shares.,2024-10-04
"@CPA022784 A lot to unpack here, you are certainly welcome to submit an article and publish these concerns. This article is more of a macro-market level piece with company highlights, but some good points nonetheless regarding founder ownership/low float.Of note, I do run the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement on all single stocks I cover through my own template using Warren Buffet's quality rules to analyze the financial statements, but it's also important to take into context the rate cycle impacts on the financial statements.There is forward looking analysis is in the article based on operations, management, industry, and the economy. Analysts make up useless earnings estimates, EPS adjustments (there's like 5 different adjusted types in their statements, all useless), and PE ratios all the time. Anchoring the stock on it's dividend payout or even free cash flow is a much better predictor of price action.",2024-10-01
@InvestorMan Sr. The NBA audit is a strong qualitative point regarding Mat Ishbia's financial strength.,2024-10-01
"@CPA022784 I won't contest all your concerns except I would suggest that the NBA does not just let anybody buy a franchise. Ishbia had to really open the books to the other owners. The financial disclosure they require to buy in is significant. While that alone is not reason to own UNMC, it should give investors some solace knowing that a bunch of other billionaires looked into and let Ishbia join their ranks. I think Ishbia runs a very credible, air tight operation. I like the huge insider ownership. I've owned UWMC for quite some time and it's one of my top 5 holdings.",2024-10-01
"Very superficial ""analysis"".  Would be helpful to at least mention some of the issues in the overwhelmingly complex financial statements - hedging, funding, future gain on sale projections by type, originations by type, all of the interlocking entities, etc. No discussion of ownership, SPAC history, impact of incredibly low float, heavy founder ownership (did Ishbia margin all of his stock to buy the Suns as he had no other assets? even if he did, does it matter?). Is the payout ratio relevant when 90% of the stock is not publicly held?  Could maybe benefit from some peer analysis which might be superior investments, like Rocket or Loan Depot, or don't they matter since they don't pay a dividend?  Not a word on appropriate valuation metrics for these mortgage companies or forward earnings estimates - should the applicable metric be forward PE or forward EV/EBITDA or something else?  Why buy under $8-9, why not $6-7 or $10-11?  Analyst consensus forward price targets are around $8, with about $0.40 EPS, making the company at a forward 20xPE. Is that relevant?  Does that already reflect all the good news for 2025?  No doubt they are a good company, generally well run and now in the right place at the right time.   However, not much at all to go on here to help with an investment analysis.",2024-10-01
"Nothing particularly new in this article, but it reaffirms my shared, long term outlook for this company. I'm collecting almost 7% on my cost basis in dividends. I am a huge, huge fan of Mat Ishbia. I'll say it again, he is the Steve Jobs of mortgage banking. He knows what the market wants before the market does and it builds the tools for brokers and borrowers to benefit. I agree, buy the dips.",2024-10-01
I have been a fan and buyer of UWMC since Jan. 2022 when I re-financed my home thru a broker usind UWM. Last year a used same for a Home Equity Loan. My Broker spoke highly of UWM and with the service they provided I purchase the stock and have added to holding on every down cycle. I'm impressed with their managment and finances. I'm glad to seeing someone covering UWMC.  Buy on the dips.,2024-10-01
@Nicholas Bratto Spot on.   I added a very small bit and will continue on any further weakness.,2024-09-20
@hueyuh1 I think refinancing will hold the key in 2025/2026. Patience.,2024-09-19
Mortgage rates up 6 basis points in the last 2 days according to cnbc.,2024-09-19
"Mixed emotions...  Price action has mixed emotions as well.  Home sales down, mortgage rates may come down, home prices will go up...",2024-09-19
