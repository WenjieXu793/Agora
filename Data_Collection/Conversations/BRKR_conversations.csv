@Engineered Quality Investments 30 P/E with bad cash conversion implies a very high FCF multiple too.,2024-09-15
"@Senopta I am not an expert of BRKR and LS equipment. From what I know, I can’t know if in 10 years BRKR will be the best in proteomics, spatial cell, etc. What I know is:- There are lots of competitors and there is a long innovation path. Competitive position in those segments is not as it has been in NMR.- 70% of sales are equipment related and the innovation risk is higher. - They will need to do M&A at high valuations.- ROICs will decrease.- Debt is very high.- They usually have bad cash conversion which doesn’t help to pay down debt.- FCF will be affected by integration and acquisition related costs.- They don’t have a lot of experience doing M&A and integrating bankrupt and unprofitable business won’t be easy. -40% of sales are from ac&gov.On the other hand, the positives are:- Fantastic competitive positioning in the core business (~45% of sales).- Great growth- High insider ownership I think there are more downsides than upsides, and BRKR trades at 30x LTM P/E (if we don’t adjust restructuring and M&A expenses). Do the risks and declining ROICs justify the valuation? I don’t think so. I wouldn’t be comfortable holding it, considering the potential returns, which is why I rated it a sell. However, this is my opinion and I don’t pretend to convince. I expose my reasoning, and readers can agree or disagree.",2024-09-15
"@Another Mountain's Rock Investing I think we should always consider risk-adjusted returns, and potential returns doesn't justify the implied risk (imo). I don't think I haven't understood the thesis, I just don't like to hold high risk companies, with low cash visibility, at high multiples (and neither does the market).   High growth segments (very innovative) force to do acquisitions at very high valuations, which decreases ROICs, which is usually followed by a multiple contraction. For instance, Waters and Agilent are starting to invest in high-growth segments and have announced that they will do more M&A.   Another option is acquiring unprofitable companies for lower prices and turn them around, of which I am not a big fan. I think this is only achievable by successful serial acquirers like CSU or DHR. Even those serial acquirers barely buy bankrupt or very unprofitable companies. Why would BRKR, with minimal experience doing M&A, be successful? I believe there's also an M&A integration risk. Furthermore, there are going to be a lot of ""restructuring"" and ""acquisition-related"" expenses, and FCF will be low for the next years, and historical cash conversion hasn't been good. How are they going to pay the 4x ND/EBITDA? I think it isn't going to be a piece of cake. Anyway, I hope I'm wrong and investors don't lose money :)",2024-09-15
@Senopta I liked DHR at the beginning of the year and agree slightly expensive now.,2024-09-10
