"I think whats missing here is an anyalisis of why the GBS buisness has been preforming poorly. We all know that GIS probably will continue it's trajectory given the history (although I still think there's upside there too).But the GBS buisness is different, it's issues are actually cyclical and not limited to that buisness. Namely customers have paused discretionary spending. Thia has been seen at all major competitors $CTSH, $ACN, $EPAM etc.So then you need to ask why? There are 2 big reasons:1. Uncertainty around AI. Customers want to pursue AI projects over traditional IT projects but AI is low return at the moment. As a result customers have paused to see how things play out.2. Higher rates. When customers do IT projects they frequently borrow money. If your interest cost is lower than the return on the IT project then the customer goes ahead and spends on the project. This is perciesly why DXC used to own 2 banks. So they can offer customers lower borrowing costs.When all the central banks raised rates optional projects that where lower return became even less economical and companies paused IT spending. This is exacerbated by the very low rate enviorment we had durring covid. Now here's where it gets interesting. The CEOs of all the IT services companies basically said that the market was unchanged quarter over quarter. So it stands to reason that if Central banks start cutting like expected we will start to see a little more growth.I do think that DXC purposefully gave conservative guidance in the hope that they can beat consistently this year and start to restore moral in the company. We shall see but I like the setup here.",2024-09-14
