@Cantankerous Cat It IS true. You just prefer a margin of safety rather than a stock priced for perfection.What makes you say a future decline of 40% is inevitable?I'd love to buy COST for the first time ever after such a decline!,2024-10-06
"@Stashley Not true. Costco had a PE of 20 not long ago. The purchase point back then was Amazon threat.  I will be repurchasing shares after the inevitable 40% decline. I’m patience, and I’ve learned that whatever shoots up in the sky eventually falls back to earth.",2024-10-06
"@dhughes327 There are plenty of different ways investors can use the stock market to make money.The use of 'technical analysis' in the article title means that the content will be of more use to traders and momentum investors than longer term holders of companies.If one is trading from momentum, then the PE is unimportant, as it is unlikely the position will be held long. Nothing wrong with the article more a misalignment of content and reader expectation.",2024-10-05
"@dhughes327 “Valuation needs to improve, and that happens if the market or COST takes a dive. The market does not see a dive coming.” l think I covered it in the article.",2024-10-04
"@NapaCab Costco and Amazon are consumers traps. Do you NEED those items and in those Costco quantities ?  I'm still looking for someone to come on SA and say they retired with all the money they saved at Costco.  Owning the shares and selling, maybe.",2024-10-04
@Tileman7 AMZN was/is my favorite online shop.  I buy something pretty much every week from them.  Didn’t stop their stock from dropping 90% in the dot com crash.,2024-10-04
"You willing to buy this with a P/E of 50???  What is this, a bitcoin style MEME stock?  Are they selling AI chips?  Buying Momentum for the sake of momentum will someday bite you hard on the back side.  I'm unsubscribing from your column!",2024-10-04
"@justaguy11 automation is inevitable. Once upon a time it took 100 farmers and ranch hands to work a thousand acres. Now it’s done by 3. Once upon a time carpenters used hand saws and hammers. That’s been upgraded for productivity. You would not be able to afford a house if 45 extra craftsmen were on the payroll cutting boards by hand. The longshoremen unload cargo. Pretty basic.  Not rocket science or brain surgery. They need to train their teams to install and repair the automated machinery not fight it. Out of 360 worldwide ports, LA and Long Beach are dead last in productivity. That’s embarrassing. Time to step it up. 8 hours of pay for 8 hours of work. No more slack hustles. No more ghost shifts for A listers.",2024-10-04
It's not over until the rank and file approve it.Anything could screw it up and the picket lines will be right back.,2024-10-03
Stike over.  Should help tomorrow if the jobs report is less than sanguine.,2024-10-03
They had better not agree to no automation or this will only happen again....and again.....and.....,2024-10-03
"@Npmijm10 You seem to be locked into the bias: if it rises, sell and take your profit—no one went poor taking a profit; they just went poor reinvesting it.  But Costco has continued to rise; so you are now thinking like a partially sold out bull.Spend some time figuring out what Costco is worth.  When I bought it around 2000 Costco was trading at around 20 p/e; it now trades at over 55. More than half your return has come from p/e expansion.  How high do you think the p/e can rise? Remember half of our gain came from Costco’s growth in earning; the other half came from p/e expansion.Costco is an extraordinary company; it has built a large margin of trust, but it is unlikely to produce the annual returns.  Costco’s growth in earnings might still provide you with a decent mid-teens annual return.  But you might also have a couple of mediocre years, as the p/e reverts to a reasonable level.  Good luck!",2024-10-03
@Peter Jaworowski Agreed.  So it makes sense to pay labor more to agree to more automation - which the ILWU did in the sixties.West Coast and East Coast have very different unions.,2024-10-03
@Peter Jaworowski I saw a proposal on Twitter that would actually be a lot cheaper in the long-run to give these parasites a one-time large settlement so they can just retire and allow the automation. It's like elevator operators 100 years ago--cheaper just to pay them to go away than to keep paying their salaries.,2024-10-03
"@dgi123 3% is nothing in the long term compared to paying an annualized fee in GLD.  IF trading gold, feel free to purchase the receipt within GLD.  IF wanting to own gold as a currency hedge over time, pay the fee and take delivery.",2024-10-03
@williamcarswell I don't doubt they'll sell out. The gold bars also sold out. The irony is that people paid a 3% premium to buy the gold bars because they're acting irrationally. Like just go buy GLD haha,2024-10-03
The moat. The float. The brand. The growth. No wonder Munger called COST a damn near perfect business.,2024-10-02
@dgi123 I can tell you the Platinum Maple Leaf coins were sold out by noon Eastern time yesterday on the Costco website.,2024-10-02
"@M11M all valid points. I will say that approximately 70% of Costco annual sales are made up of executive memberships (the not so price conscious individuals).  That other 30% is for sure some price sensitive individuals. And I feel like those individuals just have the membership for the sake of having one. I myself have a membership and only spend about $175-200 a month on groceries. I’m a simple eater, but Costco has everything I need and I know I’m going to get a good deal on it. I also know besides groceries I’ll have a gadget or two or some clothes. I do like how they’re pushing e comm, with online only items though.",2024-10-02
