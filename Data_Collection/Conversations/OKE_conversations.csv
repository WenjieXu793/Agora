@WretchedBabbler ditto here. You may want to consider adding DTM to the mix. Better then investing in electric utilities where dividend yields are lower and growth profiles pale in comparison.,2024-10-04
"@waynel7 Well I have been there and suffered a gigantic tax, and I discussed it with my accountant and in finding out exactly how it worked and in addition to not having a K-1 any more I made the decision to never again.  (MY CHOICE)I do not tell other how or where to invest but will always share my thoughts and ideas about what I do and why.",2024-10-04
"@waynel7 As for your cost basis, remember that MLP distributions usually reduce your cost basis over time. That's because the majority of an MLP's distributions are considered a ""return of capital"" by the IRS.Instead of paying taxes on distributions classified as a return of capital, these amounts are deducted from your cost basis. In other words, taxes on MLP distributions are deferred until you sell your units or the MLP is acquired.If you hold your units long enough until your cost basis reaches zero, then future distributions are taxed as long-term capital gains. Some folks plan to hold their MLP units until death, when their heirs can inherit them tax free and step up the cost basis to the MLP's closing price on the day you died.However, the lower your cost basis falls, the higher the taxable income you will report in the event of a merger or taxable conversion. All of the taxes you might have deferred over the years now come due, so taxable transactions especially hurt long-term investors whose cost bases are very low from many years of distributions.Since distributions reduce your cost basis, it's also very possible to be on the hook for a taxable gain even if the MLP's acquisition price is well below the initial amount you paid for your units.For example, suppose you initially paid $10 per unit and over the next few years received $4 per unit in distributions classified as a return of capital, reducing your adjusted cost basis to $6 per unit. If the MLP is rolled up at $7 per unit in a taxable transaction, then you would still have a taxable gain.Making matters worse, a portion of your gain can also be taxed at ordinary income rates, which are higher than the rates for capital gains. This can result from stickier accounting issues such as depreciation recapture and unrealized receivables owned by the MLP.It's also worth noting that reorganizations can create headaches for folks holding MLPs in retirement accounts such as IRAs due to issues with unrelated business taxable income (UBTI).UBTI is any ""income from a trade or business, regularly carried on, that is not substantially related to the charitable, educational, or other purpose that is the basis of the organization's exemption,"" according to the IRS.Your retirement accounts can collectively generate up to $1,000 per year in total UBTI, but if they exceed that threshold, then they must report and pay taxes on it.Most MLPs generate negative UBTI any given year, but mergers and reorganizations can trigger a substantial amount of UBTI and thus another unexpected tax liability.Just be aware, it is usually because of tax issues that large holders of MLP's will vote NO if a merger is announced or a c-corp conversions is anticipated",2024-10-04
"@TKF10 Since OKE has made new all time highs since the deal was announced, it seems that when a deal makes strategic sense and comes with synergies and potential greater system utilization but without balance sheet deterioration (no equity was issued for this deal)  Mr. market is ok with dividends and unit buybacks taking a back seat for a short stretch.",2024-10-03

"Can anyone comment on OKE’s partial acquisition of ENLC, and proposed additional acquisitions? I don’t see any recent movement of OKE or ENLC that might indicate the market has reacted, either positively or negatively.",2024-10-03
"@jonesdl261 That's not been my reality. Tax year 2023 saw a ""forced"" sell of MMP and a sell of CEQP (ET was already my largest portfolio position and I didn't want more). I had almost six figures of total passive carry forward losses and a zero tax bill.  My AGI was actually (just barely) negative. MLPs taxes are not a simple matter, but if you had all the information, perhaps you would change your mind.",2024-10-03
"I bought Oneok about three years ago around $54 per share and have watched it grow and morph into more of a growth and income play. The same thing happened to the rest of my C-Corp midstreams I bought at the same time including Williams, Antero Midstream, Plains-PAGP and Kinder Morgan. They all now trade at roughly their fair market values, but with a strong growth outlook surrounding LNG exports and natural gas fueled electricity-AI-EV power demands. These stocks will never again trade a their previous multiples with outsized dividends, but I am very pleased to leave them on Drip and let my winners run.  The MLPs do not have the institutional support for tax reasons that the C-Corps have and will probably remain at lower PEs",2024-10-02
"@The Value Portfolio I agree that OKE's valuation is a little rich at the moment. However, I think its a great long term hold and a name to opportunistically buy on any weakness. If APPL, BRK, or DE were sold at any time over the last decades when their valuation was a little rich, a tremendous amount of future profits would have been lost.I find the ""distribution is low"" argument similarly weak and shortsighted. OKE has returned over 16% over the last 20 years. I think it will provide double digit total returns over the next few decades as well.    BTW  >>  KMI's 20 year annualized total return is 3%, while EPD's is 12% and ET's is 11% Also agree with @amfmswlw that corps and partnerships are different animals and should not be used for comparisons.",2024-10-02

"I had MMP before the merger, kept OKE after, and think OKE has further earnings power that exceeds the estimates, from the MMP assets and integration.  Yes, it has run too high, and I'll lose mine as I sold Jan 87.50 calls, but Se la vie ;-)",2024-10-02
"Sold half of OKE yesterday, keeping other half for now.  Large capital gain realized.  I really like the Company very much but too pricey at this time.

Having 2000 shares with a CB of 54.64 and a dividend of .99  makes this a keeper for me.  I am in the markets almost daily and feel that this is a long term hold.,2024-10-02
"Despite the false narrative of trump and the republicans, as I have been writing on Seeking Alpha for a few years now: we live in a ""New Age of Energy Abundance"" and the U.S. is energy independent (by an estimated ~3 million boe/d) and is the #1 petroleum producer on the planet and the #1 LNG exporter on the planet. This is one reason the XLE Energy ETF is one of the worst performing sector ETFs over the past decade (if not the worst ...) and if it wasn't for Putin & Netanyahu's wars, the results would have been even worst, and likely significantly so. Meantime, note the American ""big-3"" (Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips) aren't making any significant investments in wind, solar, and battery backup capacity. As a result, they are increasingly ill-prepared for the 21st Century of electrification and they are increasingly contributing to global warming, and we saw the results of that with the horrific recent hurricane that laid waste to so much of the Southeastern U.S. and took more than 100 lives.There is no way the planet will stop burning up as long as the ""Big-3"" (little 3?) refused to invest some of their cash-flow directly into renewables. Further, the supposed ""carbon sequestration"" is a total disaster, ineffective, and waste of time, money, and resources. What a world!",2024-10-02
@sd55 Good points.  I sold half of my holdings an hour ago with OKE rallying today.  I’m retired income investor and can replace this income easy in another investment choice.,2024-10-01
I went ahead and sold half of my OKE today with price up over 92.  Huge capital gain but oh well.  Look at price graph of OKE last 20 years - clear and evident price peaks and deep valleys.  Near all time high.  Could go higher but I’m pleased with 4 bagger.,2024-10-01

@Dpdraw6 Something to consider - 2 future federal taxation possibilities that could change your mind.1.  Tax capital gains as ordinary income.2.  Remove the step-up tax basis at death for jointly held capital assets.,2024-10-01
This is really an interesting comparison.  I had WMB and sold it in January due to valuation and collected a 37% CAGR profit.  I have looked at OKE several times but never made the cut.  Both are good companies and reasonable core holdings in a taxable dividend portfolio.  I would probably pick OKE because of their ~30% forecasted FCF growth in 2025.,2024-10-01
