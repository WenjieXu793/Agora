Appreciate the article. I've recently trimmed my Newmont holding but still maintain a 4.4% of pf position.,2024-10-01
"Thanks for the article, Josh.How do you plot the chart of NEM price/normalized earnings?  Is this capability available on SeekingAlpha?",2024-10-01
"@Miners to the Moon Thanks for pointing that out, NEM has indeed benefited from a rise in silver prices. The only catch is that silver is a small part of its total revenues. This can change, of course, if silver rises to say USD 100/ounce as some forecast (link below), but will it happen?investingnews.com/...",2024-10-01
"Thank you for your piece.  Bear in mind that gold & copper are not the only contributors to NEMâ€™s results - if silver revenues are broken out, NEM is the4th-largest silver producer in the world!",2024-09-30
The next few quarters should prove interesting . . .,2024-09-30
"Good update. NEM is my largest gold/copper producer holding, and continues to have high upside as it optimizes its mine positions with both high grading divestments and operational improvements.",2024-09-30
Are you kidding? Valuation's driven by gold prices and there's a lot of catch-up still.,2024-09-27
"@Stone Fox Capital nobody KNOWS anything but it also seems you don't know how gold/miners work: Inflation has nothing to do with it in a debt spiral. Central banks aren't loading up in anticipation of inflation, dawg. If inflation was necessary for NEM to rise, why is it up 85% in 7 months with inflation moving exactly the opposite direction?? Why even respond to my comment...?",2024-09-26
@PatienceDiscipline a little.now ....medium amount at 60...my average price is about 30,2024-09-26
"so far Telfer/Havieron only, to Twiggy (Greatland, Twigs backs it/Andrew Forrest of Fortescue wealth/Wyloo investments)  not sure that was wise given the potential in the area and w copper but they are bloated and have to downsize at $NEM Barrick's problems in PNG at Porgera might give pause to how they proceed w Wafi-Golpu w Harmony? of course Lihir the monster is an island basically.  Regional tribal killings and artisanal miners, fighting in PNG, shoot em on sight at Porgera if you have a gun in public!! omg.",2024-09-18
"@badford's IRA tier 1 assets are what matters, quality over quantity. Newmont is big and bloated after the Newcrest acquisition. The company needs to sell off the higher cost tier 2 assets, pay down debt and focus on optimizing the lower cost tier 1 assets in my opinion.",2024-09-17
"I stil do not understand why NEM is selling gold mines in excellent jurisdictions?  It would seem to me that they would sell mines in poor jurisdictions.  When gold is $4000 per ounce, they will regret giving up those mining opportunities.  I think their management is at best- ""Poor"".  They seem to buy and sell their mines without consideration of future profits!  I am thinking of selling and buying more AEM or GOLD or even BTG and PAAS and SILV.  What say you precious metals investors?  Cheers!",2024-09-17
I don't like to chase stocks after a big rally. Better buy DVN near the 52 week low.,2024-09-17
"@BeaBaggage I think a native Australian, if that's what he is, is likely to do better with Australian assets...",2024-09-12
"Twiggy of $FSUMF (Andrew Forrest/ Fortescue founder and his Wyloo metals) funded up Greatland to bring Havieron online under Newcrest, of course that was put on hold when $NEM bot NCM, now they are selling the Telfer complex (Au/Cu) including Havieron so  Twigs will hopefully have better luck here via controlling Greatland $GRLGF than he did w nickel and lithium...

"Ok, I have some time now. Investing is easy if you use logic. Based on the gold price of 2500$, NEM is around fairly valued. If you think gold is going higher, then NEM is still cheap. One of the gold properties is that it is a store of value. That means that it is a hedge against inflation. Since 2021, inflation increased by around 18%. These are April numbers, I did an analysis back then. Gold has increased around the same. Now a bit more, but it is still around at pair. Simply put, gold increased what it should have increased based on its main properties. With all the geopolitical risks, the possibility of Trump winning US elections and trade wars, the chance of recession, de-dollarization and US debt, FED, and lowering of interest rates..., do you think gold should trade at some premium over long-term averages? I do. For me, gold's fair value is around 2800$, so 10% higher, and NEMs around 20% or around 60. If Trump wins, that should be at least 65-70$.",2024-09-10
