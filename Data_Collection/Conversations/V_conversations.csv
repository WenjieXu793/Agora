"Visa remains a promising investment due to its strong financial performance, evidenced by consistent revenue growth, with net revenues increasing 11% in fiscal year 2023. The company has a robust global presence and continues to expand its market reach, as seen with its strategic partnerships and innovations like Visa Direct, which saw a 19% increase in transactions. Additionally, Visa’s value-added services and new flows are growing faster than consumer payments, contributing significantly to its revenue. Despite the antitrust lawsuit, Visa’s strong market position and diversified revenue streams provide resilience and growth potential.Long $VLegal lawsuits like these usually only cause temporary price anomalies that trigger false fears among market participants.But the good thing is that the false fears of other over-anxious investors always represent great buying opportunities.",2024-10-06
"I'm not really that worried.The current antitrust lawsuit against Visa is unlikely to have a significant impact on the company's growth due to its strong market position and extensive network, which are crucial for processing electronic payments efficiently. Additionally, Visa's diversified revenue streams, including service fees and international transactions, provide a buffer against potential legal setbacks. The company has historically navigated regulatory challenges effectively, maintaining its operational capabilities. Lastly, the increasing global trend toward digital payments suggests continued demand, which can offset any short-term disruptions from the lawsuit.Long $VVisa is either a “buy” or “hold” but never a “sell”.",2024-10-06
"@ChuckXX I have positions in EPD and HESM.  Both in taxable accounts.  I have not sold any V.  The V anti-trust case (I have read the Complaint) is in SDNY and will take many years to resolve.  I just don't see now, which is a period of consolidation, as the time to sell, but I certainly understand why you would do so since it has become such an outsized portion of your portfolio.  I will say that if V had a strong growth period and got up to 325 or so in the next 6-9 months, I would strongly consider lightening my position.  Thanks for your well-wishes.  Same to you.  There is volatility coming between now and mid-January.  Buckle up.",2024-10-06
"Please explain what a ""Dip is In Visa"", percentage wise. Till they raise dividend, will not be buying anymore. Sold a few to get mine free, so everything is pure profit!",2024-10-06
"@The Cardinal VERY TRUE my friend Cardinal.  Luckily 1/2 of it was in my IRA and the other 1/2 personally.  Yes, it will be an expensive year at tax time.  Over the last 3 or 4 years I've been buying quite a bit of MLP'S which really help a ton with low taxes.  Personally, bought big positions in EPD & MPLX.   Also bought HESM in my IRA.  Hope this finds you & your family doing well my friend.",2024-10-06
"@ChuckXX You sold half of your position?  Wow, what a tax hit.  That's a major change for you Chuck.",2024-10-06
Agreed. It will probably trade sideways for a while . Great time to sell weekly covered calls. Same for GOOGL-also facing lawsuits. Covered calls are safe and provide income while shares stagnate. This too shall pass.,2024-10-06
As many know V is one of my most favorite companies.  I bought a big position at the IPO back in 2008.  Recently sold 50% of my position due single handedly to the Governments of the world continually attacking them. If you go back and look at all the money they have had to set aside from all these attacks their stock would most likely be well over $350 per share. But this is a perfect example as how governments can do serious financial damage to one of the greatest companies on the planet.,2024-10-06
@Cash Flow Venue thanks for stopping by. One of my absolute favorite stocks.,2024-10-05
Thanks for stopping by. If you enjoyed this article please feel free to like and follow me for more updates on some of your favorite dividend stocks. Also let me know if you hold Visa and are you buying the dip? Thoughts on the lawsuit?,2024-10-05
"A good start.  The next step should be to allow merchants to not accept certain high interchange cards.  Today, Visa/MC oligopolistic practices forbid merchants from only accepting certain visa/MC cards and therefore merchants are forced to bear higher interchange on certain cards.",2024-10-05
"@Blowback2 - The banks do in fact receive the majority of the interchange fees. However, the fees are assessed by MC/Visa and collected by Visa Yes, the banks control MC/Visa and the interchange pricing but it is MC/Visa that legally assesses the fees",2024-10-05
"Agreed. Since they will trade sideways a great strategy is to sell weekly covered calls , thereby bringing in extra income . Do the same with GOOGL, as they also face lawsuits.",2024-10-05
"@VictorN Personally, I just shop somewhere else. I think it's just another way to milk their customers. That said, this is a growing trend that IMO will impact the huge Visa and MC volume of transactions. Long term game changer.",2024-10-05
@esavela if so I would pay them cash. Let them handle the handling cost.,2024-10-04
"i love that cash back but hate the default 15% tip, even for takeout.",2024-10-04
Another fail by the MSM / CNBC/BLOOMBERG talking heads in that they give the banks a pass as it’s the BANKS that actually collect the majority of the fees…by far!,2024-10-04
"Another issue facing this stock is this new tendency for businesses to pass on the merchant fee directly to consumers. There are some restaurants in the area that have been doing this for a long time. But I recently took my Acura to the dealership for some maintenance and now even they are charging a 3% surcharge if you pay with Visa, MC, or Amex. This trend will eventually be a headwind for Visa.",2024-10-04
"@Dollarsandcents Yes, I have been reading up on this since we started OUR interchange (pun intended) here. I spent my career as a corporate banker, but only had tangential interactions with the merchant processing specialists. Thanks for inducing me to re-educate myself on the matter.",2024-10-03
"@nckadams - You are correct.  However, processing fees include interchange fees and interchange makes up a large part of processing fees (especially for mid to large merchants where the contractual pricing is interchange + a few pennies).  As such, the puppet masters (the issuers) use Visa/MC to set pricing.  The set up is better than OPEC because it is impossible for the members to cheat and offer lower prices in return for higher volume.",2024-10-03
