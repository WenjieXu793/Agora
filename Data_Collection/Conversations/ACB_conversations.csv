"@Shookmeister Good question and relates to countries like Canada and Germany. From the business (Aurora) side medical cannabis is a higher margin business (selling to pharmacies vs MJ retail, much less excise tax) that's also predictable and recurring. From the customer PoV they're often getting insurance coverage and the doctor would prescribe an appropriate dosage of CBD/THC. They could just then go to a retailer and pick up what they need but then again that would be out of pocket. Also, for this demographic think veterans, cancer patients, etc.Germany is a bit different at the moment since they haven't rolled out their next tier which supports retail sales, while it's still available medicinally.",2024-09-01
