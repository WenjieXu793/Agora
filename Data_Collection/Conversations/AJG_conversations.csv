"@kalu0003 Of the 3 I like AJG the best.  They are all different and have their ups and downs.  Typically I do not give advice, as I am not a professional, but more of a chartist and look at fundamentals of companies.  AJG has a nice sawtooth chart if you are a trader, but not me, typically hold for 2 yrs or more.    I do not hold any degree or any advanced degree in finance, accounting or business, as I am a graduate engineer.   I have both AJG and BRO in my personal portfolios.  I like them over MMC, as they are smaller companies and have the ability to grow their companies cash revenue at a faster rate Y/Y and have lower % dividends and distribution rates than MMC, but what I evaluate is the Total Return and compare them in different terms of time.  MMC has the highest % of institutional investors and is huge compared to the others, hence the higher  revenues, dividend and % distribution etc. , but the smallest % insider ownership.   MMC would be a safe place if I thought safe was the way to go, but I am typically in favor of the smaller more agile companies.  No MMC for me in the near future especially since I have the other 2.  Somewhere AJG will have to assess their asset buying spree of more than 20 companies a year, as they buy the company, assess the book, mitigate their Admin costs and roll them into the company network.  Hope this helps, IMO.",2024-10-01
"@Sparkle0135 In your view, are BRO and MMC bad long term investments relative to AJG?  Thanks in advance for your PERSONAL views on this.",2024-09-30
"""Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF), which during the week posted an increase in its delinquency and net charge-off rates for August, accelerated 9.6%;""I can't think of a better reason to bid up a stock.  If this isn't a bubblicious market top call I don't know what is.  I know they don't ring bells but hey more defaults is obviously bullish how can it not be.  Especially since the FED just cut 50 causing the 10 year to shoot higher meaning debt costs will actually increase in the near term.  I'm going all in Monday on massive margin.  Haven't been in margin since pre covid but I'm doing it.  Super bullish times.",2024-09-21
