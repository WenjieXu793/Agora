Well in regards to the obesity drugs I have an observation which may be unpopular but here goes. I think it will help the snack food industry because people will do the worst thing for themselves.   So they will take the obesity drugs then they will also eat nothing but cookies because they can. They didn't get obese by making good choices and just giving them a magic pill isn't going to change their behavior patterns which is what needs to happen. I've seen people get fat again after having laparoscopic surgery and losing a ton of weight.  Majority of people don't like the tummy issues associated with the drugs and stop within 3 months.  That's generally 2 1/2 months longer than that new exercise plan they started because this year is the year.  Now will it affect the bottom line? I don't think either case is going to affect the bottom line. Most of the people consuming junk food are kids and we're never going to be short on those.,2024-09-22

"As is well known, equity valuation models are not an exact science.In this case the Intrinsic Value is calculated as the average of DCF and Relative values.The intrinsic value of one Mondelez stock under the Base Case scenario is $72.58. Compared to the current market price of $74.28, Mondelez is overvalued by 2%.Long $MDLZRecently, the share price has risen faster than the fundamentals expected in the future.Therefore, I would rather wait until the next dip before buying.In my opinion, the current offering is not that great and patience usually pays off.",2024-09-22
"@frommi I agree with this figure and wrote about it. But in addition to growth rates, I described 8 more parameters, some of which are quite weak. If you buy shares only by profit growth rates, then the idea is ok. If you look at the business more comprehensively, then you will find a mountain of problems. This is my opinion with arguments.",2024-09-11
