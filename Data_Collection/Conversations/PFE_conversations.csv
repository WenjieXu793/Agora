"@William Cohen I agree product liability litigation is a fact of life in the drug industry.  And while I did choose to sell all my shares, one reason was I had a low basis in my shares and I could sell at a price that gave me a tidy profit.  So for me, I sold within minutes of when the drug recall news hit the fan.  I will watch to see what the reaction will be and if nothing big happens, I may reinvest. So far, the price has DROPPED below where I sold it and not recovered, so honestly making the sale was the right thing for me to do, as I can buy the stock I sold back and be in an even better position than before I sold. I have bought and sold (essentially traded) in and out of Pfizer stock several times this year.  Since I have made good gains doing what I do with this stock, I'll keep doing that.  I am NOT necessarily a buy and hold investor with PFIZER as it's dividend is TOO LOW to meet my criteria. Finally, the drug authorities in Europe were about to force a total recall in Europe because the efficacy of the drug was not favorable.  That means the drug was deemed by a regulatory authority of NOT being worthy of patient use, particularly if it was contributing to too many deaths.  Essentially Pfizer pulled the drug worldwide to get ahead of the news of it being forced to withdraw a ""bad drug.""  I agree with Pfizer's actions as by stopping the use of the drug which  means no more deaths and less product liability.  So this could all blow over without major litigation.  If it does, I can always buy back in.",2024-10-06
"Yes, history suggests the stock will rise for a few days but let´s hope they push for structural changes and please bring in a visionary CEO.They should first stop pretending Pfizer actually does any serious in-house R&D as it has been an excuse and a huge failure. Whatever they have is either thru 3rd party purchases or sheer fluke. Push for the overhaul of that entire department first.",2024-10-06
I've been such a disappointed PFE shareholder for so long I simply can't get excited about this. I'll just hold my shares and watch. I'll believe it when I see it.,2024-10-06
"@itzcuintli5 I don't know. From 2010 to 2018, PFE's share price went from 17 to 44. The share price was pretty much a rising pattern. Bourla's performance is a bit of a up and down. His lousy acquisition of GBT is probably a firing offense.",2024-10-06
"I'd like to see them push it up.....they selling the haleon stock...buy back the shares with the funds instead of padding the pockets of the execs, this is too low at sub 30....I think these guys like stakes with stocks with bigger dividends. I have them with Algonguin.",2024-10-06
"@Rhoda711 yeah, you bring in the guy who picked the guy who started this mess.  I’d get rid of this stock but we’ve got 14 shares spread over 3 accounts.",2024-10-06
@William Frey won't be the same MO for Pfizer. 5 billion shares and mountain of debt. Buyback won't make a dent. Cutting dividend will trigger an exodus of institutional holders but it may not be a bad idea. The current yield is too high. Cutting half and use the saving to do buyback is a good idea.,2024-10-06
"If it can’t get over $31 on this news, then that’s saying a lot.",2024-10-06
"@William Frey From 7/15/24 letter to Match: ""As shown above, Match is currently trading at less than 8.5x 2024 free cash flow, a level we believe dramatically undervalues the Company. At or around the current valuation, we believe Match should be using 75% or more of its free cash flow, plus some or all of the approximately $900 million of available capacity under its 3.0x net leverage target, to repurchase shares. These buybacks would enable Match to shrink its share count, and, if coupled with the operational improvement opportunities outlined above, these buybacks can significantly accelerate free cash flow per share growth. We believe there is no better use of cash for Match than repurchasing its own shares at this level.""",2024-10-06
Swell…  “Read was Pfizer's (PFE) chief executive officer from 2010 to 2018 and picked Pfizer's current CEO Albert Bourla as his successor.”Hmmm,2024-10-06
@TraderJoeZ Well the magic elixir may well be to cut the dividend and take on debt to buyback cheap shares.  Not a fan of the activists.,2024-10-06
OMG. Finally. But the stock hasn’t moved at all. Float must be HUGE!!!,2024-10-06

"@William Cohen the risk is that the new drugs are not the blockbusters that the company needs to replace the LOE. The sales potential of these new drugs still has to be proven and is far from certain. What is much more certain is the loss of sales from the LOEs, and from the Medicare negotiations.",2024-10-06
"@justanopion Why would you sell if the share price increases?  What's most important is yield-on-cost, and as time progresses, yield-on-cost for already-purchased shares typically increases.  Selling to buy something else does not make sense, unless one honestly believes that the underlying business is failing.",2024-10-06
"At this share price level ($28 to $29 a share), PFE is as close to a ""can't lose"" investment as one might find.  It is true that certain drugs are going to lose patent protection in the not-too-distant future, however the company is priced as if its pipeline of new drugs is running dry.  We know that's not true.  In fact, quite the opposite is true.  Once the average investor figures this out, the share price will jump.I am loading up at this level, and plan to hold these shares indefinitely, and collect the well-covered 5.88% dividend yield.  And since I care most about yield-on-cost, this already generous yield will surely increase over time, as new profitable drugs are released, and EPS increases.",2024-10-06
@bananawhopper Exactly. You can also buy SGOV or FLOT for a super-safe monthly distribution of 5%,2024-10-06
