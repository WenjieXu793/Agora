"Second crazy ROL fact:  The family owners of ROL could instead sell their entire stake in ROL and put the cash into 10 year US treasuries.  They would make 60-70% more cash per year by doing this simple swap than by keeping their ROL shares, as 10Y is yielding about 3.8% and ROL about 2.2%.  By ""doing nothing"" but collecting US gov bond coupons they almost double their income.",2024-09-19
"More crazy ROL facts:  The fcf yield of ROL is on par with.... NVDA.  That's right.  NVDA is projected to do $60bn in fcf in 2025, which compared to the $2.7 trn market cap is 2.2%.  2.2% is the same fcf yield as ROL ($500mn in fcf / $25bn market cap).   So yeah, ROL operates in a 2% growth mature market.  ROL is not in any way growing like NVDA over the next 5 years, and so ROL is MORE expensive than NVDA.",2024-09-19
"I am now maximum short.  All the organic  growth has been the result of inflation and rising pricing over the past three years.  That’s over.  Look at RTO last earnings release, U.S. is a 2% growth market according to Terminix.  And I would argue Terminix is faster growth bc it’s a smaller more nimble company.  Anyway……. Yeah ROL is a good business.  But even if you factor in medium growth, there is a price for that, and it is not anywhere near 35x Ebitda or $50 a share.  Let’s take a step back.  ROL is trading at a 2.5% fcf yield.  Ok, so it will take 10 years of 5% organic growth just to reach the yield of a 10 year U.S. treasury of 4%.  And 5% is twice the RTO-pegged market growth rate.  Crazy.  ROL 35x forward Ebitda.  RTO 11x Ebitda.  I would argue the Terminix business is actually more valuable than ROL.  And no, RTO will not rise in value to meet  ROL 2.5% fcf yield.  They will meet somewhere in the middle  perhaps.  There’s really a lot of downside here at $50 on an absolute value basis AND on a relative value basis",2024-09-17
"Rollins is a must own and never sell stock.An enrichment for every portfolio and almost always too expensive.Rollins demonstrates consistent and robust financial performance, highlighted by double-digit revenue growth across all major service lines and strong organic growth. The company maintains healthy profit margins, with gross margins consistently above 50% and operating margins improving year-over-year. Rollins' strategic investments in acquisitions and modernization efforts, coupled with a strong cash flow and low debt levels, position it well for sustained growth. Additionally, the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases further enhances its attractiveness as a long-term investment.Rollins' Cash Return On Invested Capital (CROIC) of 25.4% ranks in the 93.5% percentile for the sector.Long $ROLIn other words, never sell a super compounder with this cash generating quality or life will punish you.",2024-09-17
