A list of dividend stocks without the dividend percentages is not helpful. It took a lot of wasted time to click back and forth to get the individual dividend rates.,2024-10-03
"I will add Resources Connection (RGP) to the list.RGP is debt-free, cash-rich, pays 6% dividend, while also being very cheap, based on all the key multiples.",2024-10-03
I hate these lists that pay no regard to recent price performance.,2024-10-03
Steady Eddy in 2024 so far.  25% gain.   But PE is high.  Hold and dripping dividends.,2024-09-12
"Hard to believe that SA didn't feel it newsworthy that KIM was upgraded to A- credit rating by Fitch on 09 Sep.  They have pursued this for years, and long overdue in my opinion.  The other rating agencies will likely fall in line soon.  KIM is my third largest stock position and it has been gratifying to watch the rally.  My #2 position is ADC, and they have also been on fire.  I'm expecting KIM to bump the div to .25 for the Dec payment.  KIM has been aggressive in acquisitions, and no doubt they are working on another significant buy.  This is a great retiree stock.  Thanks for the article!",2024-09-11
Long Kimco for years. I like the structure and the management and if it ever got in the margin of safety on price would consider adding on.,2024-09-10
