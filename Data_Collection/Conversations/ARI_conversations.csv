@Rob G. in Vegas  We also have dividend  raises  .  .  So far  very few  cuts. We have  40%  in fixed  income   mainly  preferred stocks baby  bond s  .    .,2024-09-18
@Trapping Value My focus is raising my income  all the time.  . I rarely sell.   MY IRA easily  supports  my RMD.  NOW  I am 82   .  .Now my taxable account is growing  because I invest my RMD  keepin in mind taxes.     .My strategy works very well because higher income   serves me well.      .  .  .,2024-09-18
@Trapping Value sold ACRE with  a profit  and long Preferred .Yes sticking BRSP . Why  Not The manager is managing correctly .. I am adding on significant dips. .My income  performance  at record highs.  .I backed up  my garbage truck.     .   I will revisit  TPVG  if rates keep  going down.,2024-09-18
@Rob G. in Vegas The big risk I think with the high yield sector (whether it is CEFs using big leverage or mortgage REITs) is that it may really not matter whether you own 5 or 50 of these. Diversification benefits will be poor as they all track fairly closely when credit spreads really spike.,2024-09-18
"@Trapping Value Good grief - ARI was yet another high-yield BUY recommendation from that popular income service here on SA.  Over the last 3 months, that shop has without a doubt set a new record for buy recommendations that cut their dividends.This might truly be an unprecedented achievement that will never be broken here on SA - sort of like Joe Dimaggio's 56-game hitting streak in MLB.seekingalpha.com/...""While other commercial mREITs are staying on the sidelines, deciding not to take action and remaining conservative, waiting for better weather, ARI is out in the field. It is getting what has to get done to continue to reward shareholders as effectively as possible. While I respect and understand both approaches and maintain healthy allocations to holdings that have taken both these approaches, I am enjoying steady dividends from ARI.""",2024-09-18
"Hey, this is way more than .02 cents worth! Thank You Sir.",2024-09-18
"@thebellsareringing No we just happen to interact on the garbage stocks you buy cause they yield more. I happen to warn on them. BRSP, ARI, ACRE, TPVG, IEP (doubt you own or ever owned that one). So many cuts and so poor returns.",2024-09-18
"@Trapping Value I sold  TPVG after  reconsidering  my decision to hold. I recall  the  CFO resigned  because  his  income  was down. That  was a tell for me. I knew it was you who this article before  I read your name as the author..   As rates go down TPVG  opportunities  to make more loans ,  because the sector they focuson will improve.  I don't usually look back  after I sell. I don't follow you.",2024-09-18
"@thebellsareringing I believe you said the same thing about TPVG. Both likely to be zeros in a moderate to severe recession. ARI, better portfolio but far higher leverage.",2024-09-18
"@Croogie YepResi mREITs - no credit risk but they blow themselves up with interest rate risk Commerical mREITs - no interest rate risk, but they blow themselves up with credit risk Pick you poison Still have a small position in the 29 bonds, so glad to see the divi being cut, and while an equity placing would be dilutive, Apollo will do that (I hope) if need be to keep the management fees rolling inBought the bonds at a 9.3 YTM, now they're showing a 7.7 yield so tempting to take profits - at >9 it was compelling at 7 something its so so and and close to 7 or a 6 they're  a clear sell",2024-09-18
I am keeping  ARI in my portfolio.  I believe the  management  has the  skills  and  expertise   to take  a punch. ARI has solid relationships  with their lenders. I might  add that  their  connection  with APOLLO  is a plus.  .The dividend  is still  attractive Instead of running  away I added.,2024-09-17
@PendragonY Didn't we have this conversation 2 or 3 months ago when You said the dividend was covered and I said dividend going to 25c then 20c. Hmm torpedo away!,2024-09-17
I had a very small position that I inherited and dumped promptly after your last article!,2024-09-17
"@NecessityMadeMeDividendInvestor Yep, the market over-reacted and now the yield is almost 15%.",2024-09-13
@upnorthwi They need to match outflow with inflow. But I am confident the market will over-react and give us a good buying opportunity.,2024-09-13
Perfect time to start or add to an existing position.,2024-09-13
"@BartAtTheRanch Yes. I think it will get sorted out over the few quarters. Being 8 hospitals or properties, someone will jump in.",2024-09-12
"@LetsGoBrandon86ed ARI is yielding 10.50% after today's dividend cut, not 13%!",2024-09-12
@carlmoni there is also the TIMING that some of the sellers will do so as tax planning closer to year end,2024-09-12
"@upnorthwi  Another great pick from Rida to go along with some of his other great picks like MPW, CBL, WPC, AMZA among others as well as some of his CEF picks with their significantly negative price returns over the last 10 years! ",2024-09-12
