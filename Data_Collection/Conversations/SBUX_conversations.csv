"I get a $.99 large iced coffee every day through McDonald’s app. I had to pay almost $7 for a Starbucks coffee, rung up with 15% tip, for don’t-ask-me-what-size, but it was smaller than a McDonald’s large. Why anyone would pay $6 more for basically the same product beats the heck out of me. Hence, I think an investment in Starbucks stock makes no cents/sense whatsoever.",2024-10-06
"“if you’re not happy at Starbucks, you can go work for another company.”Pointing out logical facts is now against the law.  Cool.",2024-10-05
"Really? 16,121 + 500 stores? Too many coffee shops. Other chains are springing up all over my area. They are over built and the business has a low barrier to entry. Doubt you'll ever see a $100+ share price again, ever.",2024-10-04
As if we needed any more proof that unionized Starbucks employees are bad news.,2024-10-04
"Clearly, someone has gotten jealous of a creative billionaire turning a common coffee shop into a mega business. They will someday soon drive this wonderful company into bankruptcy. Store should not be unionized.",2024-10-04
This is the best SBUX analysis I've read. Thank you.,2024-10-03
You get corruption from a union. I belonged to the steelworkers union and the union was on managements payroll   High dues for nothing,2024-10-02
A  sole job at SBUX was never ever meant to support a family.Even at a managers pay it's not that great either.There already fewer and fewer baristas on the floor already it's only will get worse. Before long a I pad will be on the counter for you to place and pay for your order.  In drive thru AI will  take care of your order soon enough.The pandemic and the younger generations have taught us to use technology so you don't need to the human connection anymore.Sorry to say that its the future  No need for human contact.,2024-10-02
"@Peter Jaworowski I grew up in Michigan. I was a Teamster while in college working for UPS. Then in UPS management. Many of my family and friends were either UAW or Teamsters. I have written academic papers on labor that are on file at the Walter P. Reuther Labor Library at Wayne State University in Detroit. I became a CPA and financial executive, then an entrepreneur, Inc500 two years running (my picture is in Inc Magazine). I have seen all sides of the issue. Trust me, collective bargaining is good for this county, our economy, consumer demand, workers rights (whether union or not). I consider myslf an expert on this issue. I think it is only the greedy or those ignorant of labor who are anti union. IMO",2024-10-02
@lowdawg81 Incompetent management makes a company non-investable.  SBUX has had plenty of that lately too.,2024-10-02
@esavela while I am not the biggest fan of unions they have their place and have helped a lot of blue collar workers.  But for a company like Starbucks which is a transition role...lots of part timers....the union effort feels out of place almost as if they are preying on the employees. I feel bad for the part time college students who end up paying union dues for their 15 am hour.,2024-10-02
No longer worthy of ones investment money.  Unions make a company non investable.,2024-10-02
It probably would be easier to replace Starbucks workers with robots than almost any fast food restaurant like McDonalds.,2024-10-02
"@No Guilt Sure, agree. But it's an overpriced product that is not as popular as once was. With operational issues to boot. Sell your stock now while you can still get $90 for it. $60-70 stock is a more appropriate long term range. IMO",2024-09-30
"@esavela Yeah, and you can also brew your own beer versus buy it for $1 at the grocery store versus buy it for $8 at the bar.Not everybody at Starbucks just grabs their coffee and goes.Starbucks didn’t grow into one of the largest businesses in the world because they’re competing with people making coffee at home for a quarter.",2024-09-29
@Pizza Boi I hope you don’t think I can make the stock price move. Because I can’t. Haha.,2024-09-28
"@Marystrata, 3rd. level CGA Curious, long term play or looking for momentum trade?I’m not interested in any of that with SBUX, I’m looking for secular winners and companies I think will turn into huge dividend growers trading below my intrinsic valuation estimates.",2024-09-28
@diroha prudent choice to sell call. I’m interested if the market begins to agree with me and management rolls back from expansion.,2024-09-28
"@diroha,Longtime holder as well and coincidently have also sold January calls as well....!! Only problem is I sold them too low and will most definitely need to roll them out soon....Tiger",2024-09-28
@Clark158f1 Should it have stayed mired in the 70's given this CEO's track record?,2024-09-28
