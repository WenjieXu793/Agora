"Readers, and the author, should be aware that YCharts cooks up its own FFO. In this case the NAREIT FFO disagrees strongly with what is shown in that plot. But even NAREIT FFO is not reliable because various GAAP distortions are not corrected. CfO is much more reliable in general as an earnings measure and YCharts does not mess with that. For CPT, NAREIT FFO and CfO are both upward and then flat since the low in 2021. Share count has grown 9% over the past three years.   Paul",2024-09-24
