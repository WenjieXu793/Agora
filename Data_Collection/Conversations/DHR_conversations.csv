"@SUE2 ""An American WORKER produces more than four times what a Chinese WORKER does?""usa products & services are far overpriced.compare McDonalds prices and wages in Shanghai, Hong Kong & San Francisco as the prices are comparable or cheaper in China.but business is 8x busier in Shanghai and the workers earn pittiance 4600rmb/m 2016 and under 13000HKD/m in HK 2020. where Berkeley earns 2023 entry level $18/h.food isn't better in Berkeley than HK. Who deserves less productivity. workers in HK and more so in Shanghai & Beijing are over 8x busier.November 2020, HK living was 85% of Jan 2021, San Mateo living that is PPP!",2024-09-19
@SUE2 not hate my nation.1997 Shanghai was 40years behind sister city San Francisco.2015 Shanghai had complete social transformation & 30 years ahead of SF BayArea.2024. No improvements actually worse social conditions in USA,2024-09-19
"@solidvalue you are right, i underestimated.  it is gonna get so much worse.  the MIC is getting the rights to build 2400 f 35s at 190 million per, and they don't even work, slow junk with junk weapons that the russians would not even taken an application for, so primitive, short ranged, unreliable and laughably inaccurate and inept....but the con goes on.......what an absurdity, that and the titanic debt snowballing towards us.",2024-09-18
"@bluescorpion0 you have the mainstream media take on things Geopolitical and financial.  Let's agree to disagree.  buy gold and the producing miners today a tremendous buy, see Paul Franke's most recent and other SA articles, a national investing champ btw. U R welcome",2024-09-18
"@bluescorpion0 no.  having 7 trillion in outlays and 4.6 trillion in revenues and printing the difference or borrowing the difference annually is crazy.  With the debt now going ballistically out of control, that is crazy. The party forever crowd and borrow forever government have pushed the country over the cliff.  And there is nothing the citizens can do about it.   40 million illegals is crazy.  A new military spending bill is factoring in 2 trillion on a new F35 production plan of roughly 190 million per F 35 yet produced, for jets that have been proven not to even work, with technologies 20+ years old (outdated), is crazy.  70 percent of the F35's already made to date, for a borrowed outlay of well in excess of 1 trillion dollars, where 7 of 10 cannot be flown due to so many defects, is crazy......the country is over.  The nutjob americans bombing the russian mainland, is crazy, where Russia has nuclear delivery systems that are 15 to 35 years more advanced than america's, that is crazy.  Their weapons seem like magic to the american military and the weapons corporations.  We only have theories of how they work, because if we knew how they worked, we would have them ourselves.   That is crazy",2024-09-17
"@panzer Servicing our $35 Trillion in National Debt is more like $1.1 Trilliona year ($3 Billion a day) and rapidly growing, much more than the $2 Billion a day we spend on National Defense.",2024-09-17
"@tool man The REALITY is interesting and known by few. My view when people do not know the reason is that BIG BROTHER does not want us to know. Our two largest creditor nations are Japan and China. I list Japan first because they actually hold slightly more than China. More SHOCKING.Together Japan and China hold roughly 20% of our National Debt. Social Security holds 40%. HUH?  Imagine buying your own debt with obligations.IF, a company was doing this we would SCREAM to our government to shut them down.",2024-09-13
"Leo - solid writeup. I agree valuation is seemingly challenged but, couple things for investors to keep in mind....valuation is elevated on a p/e basis but DHR converts EPS to FCF above 100% and has for 30 years, so valuation slightly less demanding on FCF. And, even less so still on a forward basis.Second, it is the very rare company that proactively shrinks itself to continue its long term compounding journey. That is exactly what DHR has done in recent years to refocus. Mitch Rales said as much in his recent long form interview. He explicitly discussed the continuation of compounding several times in that interview.Last, the Rales bros have been amazing stewards over the past 40 years and that continues. For me, this a 'Berkshire' like asset where investors can make a concentrated investment and have confidence that it will likely compound around 10% over the long term - and that is attractive for most investors.Finally, here is a great writeup I found on DHR that is worth a read...www.spreecap.com/...",2024-09-12
"@panzer i know putin is too obsessed with ABSOLUTE RULE, & so is Xi.i think the reason Russia became a wealthy economy, is their military assault on Ukraine jacks up the GDP",2024-09-12
"@Shaduc russian economy is soaring.  No debt, The cleanest balance sheet of the largest 50 economies in the world.  Do not believe the ridiculous Putin hate bs.  He has completely transformed the country since the day he got in, almost 25 years ago, where it was a shambles.  Those are the realities.  and the Western Oligarchs hate him with a passion, and who are, by and large, the Western financial class?  One guess.",2024-09-11
"@Shaduc china economy at least 2X, possibly 3X that of america.  Our financial figures are all rigged.  For instance, 20% of annual gdp is from ""government spending"".....this is not productivity.  It is waste, so this is actually a 20% deduction, which means a 40% point swing.  You deduct 20%, don't add it.  Another almost 20% is from Medical/Hospital.  I just remove this altogether, .  Caring for the sick is not productivity in my mind.  Which means we are at 40% true figure of what we report.  China is therefore 2 to 3X America's annual reported GDP.   The categories are arbitrary, made up by the financial industry.  America loves its residential real estate, lolcnn.  At all times, in all places, residential real estate is worth 3X the annual income of those living in the neighborhoods immediately adjacent to the home in question...........America's real estate will go down as much as 50% in the remainder of this decade, causing the goofy, uneducated americans (what is left of the middle class) to sheat their pants.",2024-09-11
"@Dweckl "" China is in demographic decline""leadership has prepared for that 25 years ago.20 years at least ago, we were dependant on China for rare earth materials, to be resolved in 20 years. We did nothing. been to living there are 2 matters. from Y2k-2010 at least USA govt workers or diplomats missed China's rise as they were glowing in how well they were treated there vs in USA.that's how China became the 2nd largest economy, while USA declined.again USA was global monopoly 200 buy by 2007, buinessweek front cover Chinusa driving global growth"" that is bipolar world.USA arrogance!!",2024-09-10
"@Shaduc And yet we are still the strongest, and biggest, economy in the world, and China depends on us, we do not depend on China.",2024-09-09
