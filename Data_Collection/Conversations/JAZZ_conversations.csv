"@liegh aulper Because Jazz stock price has fallen markedly since Jan. 2023 and again during 2024, bottom line analyst Mr Market picked up on it.",2024-09-19
"Interesting that in recent court filings JAZZ refers to Lumryz as its most feared competitor and it expects to lose well over $700 million in sales of Xyrem and Xywav to Lumryz. Funny, none of the analysts have picked up on this, nor has JAZZ ever discussed it in any of their public statements.",2024-09-19
@angus135 no this was for the expedited appeal of the injunction decision.,2024-09-18
Anyone read the briefs for the expedited appeal? Which way will da Judge go?,2024-09-18
"@liegh aulper the chat yesterday at wainwright had a very small reference that AVDL had been informed they are “in the window” for the judges decision. Whatever that means.  Seems like the judge is taking his sweet time.  The FDA response today was pretty forceful, I’m sure they are getting annoyed with Jazz’s constant entering of new really weak arguments/so called evidence.  I’m curious if the FDA is simply waiting on result of the lawsuit to announce the pediatrics official call (Avoiding wasting time with more legal BS from Jazz.)  I will say the wainwright chat and JP Morgan chat (CFO/CEO and one other think), were very informative.  Good to hear from the CEO in a candid manner.  For those that want to listen links are below.
