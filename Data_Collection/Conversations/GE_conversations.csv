@MySami it will be greatly reduced if Pooh decides to invade Taiwan. I think Putins disaster in Ukraine is giving him second thoughts.,2024-10-05
@123semi It's not in Putin's interest for him to unilaterally pull out of the Ukraine at this time..The West will have to offer Putin a plausible off ramp dealthat will allow Putin a reason to quit fighting.Putin has control of approx 20% of the Ukraine land mass.Most of it he has controlled since 2014.  Perhaps the best time to have seriously negotiated with Putin would have been 8 years ago...? As it stands now its absolutely fantasy to think Putin willexit the whole of Ukraine without Zelensky giving up someterritory to get a deal done.,2024-10-05
Day 950 of the 3 day SMO. But according to Putler everything is going to plan!!,2024-10-04
"@MySami really. Russia is already facing massive labor shortages amd inflation because of the lack of working age men. Drafted, fled the country or dead. You need to study Russian demographics. They are in big trouble.",2024-10-04

As much as I think GE's future is bright its valuation compared to CMI or CAT is very rich.So...i will gaze from afar.,2024-10-02
The market isn’t even paying attention to GE rn. I feel like it’s going under the radar. This tells me it’ll continue higher.,2024-09-28
"@MichaelW_R I love buying companies when they get booted from the Dow. GE was one, & xom the other one. Look at them now.",2024-09-27
"Hopefully ba gets it together, long ba, but I see ge continuing to rip. First big resistance level is 200. Than it can build a base & go even higher",2024-09-27
@SUE2 yes and the free world has decided to support Ukraine against fascist Russias invasion. And the Russian people are paying a terrible price for Putins ego. A terrible price. Will he continue to drive Russia to utter destruction for nothing.,2024-09-27
"Stagflation…“As Russia's GDP and inflation figures move in the wrong direction, the worst-case scenario for any economy looms large over Moscow.""There are signs of cooling domestic demand. However, there is no reduction in inflationary pressure,"" Russia's central bank said in a summary of its latest policy meeting, translated by Bloomberg.”",2024-09-27
"@StreptopeliaTurtur yes this is about rebuilding the Russian empire which equals putins ego. What has Russia accomplished for all this death and destruction. And you forget one thing in your equation. Wars have to be paid for! A few years in Afghanistan bankrupted the ussr and Russia has lost about 10x men, equipment etc in Ukraine. Plus now Russia itself is being bombed everyday. If this is what the Russian people want so be it.",2024-09-26
"@jd99 Perhaps I should do a comparitive analysis on both, but it is difficult since GE is a ""more focused"" business. I think one thing to keep in mind is that GE is much bigger than RTX in wide body engines. I don't have the numbers readily available but if I recall correctly the number of engines that GE has under LTAs, that is the total installed base of RTX engines.",2024-09-25
Your research adds a lot of value. My question is ig GE Aero is worth $200b what is the potential value of Pratt if they overcome thier issues in say 2 years. In terms of market share it is approx 2/3 of GE and thus potentially worthapprox $135b which is most of RTX’s current mkt cap.,2024-09-25
Ukraine is not capable of defending Kursk on a long term basis,2024-09-24
"I have trimmed my GE position and reclaimed everything I ever invested in it, but continue to hold a position consisting of my ""winnings.""  The current share price seems to me to be levitating, and I am expecting some pullback. We will see.GLTA",2024-09-24
"You make a compelling argument here, but I did a deep dive into the defense sector this past weekend, and concluded that all of the aerospace/defense stocks including GE, LHX, GD, LMT, HII, TXT and even my precious RTX are all fairly and fully priced at this particular moment in time. I still maintain a material position in RTX although I have trimmed it by about half.",2024-09-24
"I cannot help but ask......Would GE entertain a small stock split? There are 1B shares outstanding currently. Perhaps 3:2:-))Also, would it not be appropriate to now add back GE Aerospace to the Dow Jones??",2024-09-24
"@tnengrchem The P/E ratio is high for an industrial. However, personally I think SA is missing the point. I have learned over time sometimes numbers don't tell all of the story. Boeing is hurting. GE needs Boeing BUT yes GE needs Boeing but due to Boeing's commercial aircraft delivery schedule which is unfortunately being pushed out, all of the commercial airlines will need to retain their current fleet of aircraft engines for longer:-)) This means more shop visits and significantly more business for GE. Margins on the shop visits are significantly higher than margins on new aircraft engine sales. How much well let the sell side guys figure that out!! Let me add in also Larry Culp is the BEST in the business!!!!!! P/E ratios are only part of the story. Full disclosure I have owned GE for some time. GE's future is extremely bright!!!",2024-09-24
@sdm_376 after the spinoff in April GEV is the company that now holds the former GE nuclear group.  GE is a pure aerospace company now.,2024-09-23
