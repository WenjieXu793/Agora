the US port strike will impact LEA and i'm thinking we should potentially see some more downside ?,2024-10-02
"Thank you, this is probably the best analysis of Lear Iâ€™ve read in five years.  One thing I might add, is the T1 platform through General Motors, will be renewing for another 5 years beginning next year. Lear has that locked in, it would seem, with no additional tooling expenditures and zero learning curve.",2024-09-26
