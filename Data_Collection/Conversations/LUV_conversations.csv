Elliot will eliminate the LUV dividend.  And Elliot can’t make Boeing make more planes for LUV.  No thanks..left with a small profit and dividends….watching for a much lower entry point in teens,2024-10-06
"why is the sale of 10,000 shs by Broadcom CEO notable ?  he still owns 1.2 million shs...barely news and certainly not notable",2024-10-06
"@Dhierin Bechai or Airlines follow the OPEC model ie if we stay together we all win if we try to annilate each other with fare wars we lose - ie they add capacity only when they believe demand will sustain and not just a fleeting thing,  but its more then supply chain , they dont even have enough Pilots even if they wanted to expand capacity and had the planes being shipped in LOL",2024-10-06
"@munhoi The reason why the overcapacity is relatively modest right now is because the aerospace supply chain issues, else this would have been way worse.",2024-10-06

"CVNA insiders are dumping stock like crazy.  Garcia has been selling 100,000 shares of stock  almost every day for months.  According to barchart, there have been 5.4 million shares sold by insiders in the last three months, worth about 970 million dollars at todays share price.  Amazing. www.barchart.com/...",2024-10-06
@Always Bullish The main issue besides the cost is the capacity additions. This industry is notorious for adding capacity in excess of demand  and that makes it extremely difficult to generate good margins.,2024-10-06

"@munhoi You appear not to know about airline systems and how they are developed and maintained. It doesn't take a genius, just a guy with real facts about what Southwest is actually doing.Cheap attacks on Southwest's it systems indicate that you are unaware of the breadth of systems required in airlines today, nor where, how and who maintains these systems.  Many of these systems are packages that are current state-of-the-art  and updated regularly. Other components of systems environments are maintained by specialist firms or programming specialists globally.  I am a consultant and have worked with companies and consultants that provide these services, and update the systems software, provide communications services and support ""state-of-the-art"" systems.  Blurting out misinformation means that you did not read-up on the causes of Southwest's meltdown a couple of years ago.   Even Southwest said ""Our crew sharing software didn’t stop working during the disruptions, but a combination of our processes and the technology couldn’t keep up with the pace of cancellations at the height of the weather disruptions,”  Your post also suggests that these companies are not responsible for developing plans for when systems fail. Southwest's systems  did not fail during the Crowdstrike outage, yet you suggest that ""overhaul their entire computer systems"" while Delta lost 5,000-6,000 flights. Real facts are important in criticisms.",2024-10-06
"@munhoi So you must know the inner workings of Southwest systems as you recommend ""LUV has to overhaul their entire computer systems..."" You cant analyze anything to get to your recommendation unless you know every internal system southwest has.  Unless you work at Southwest, there are no sources for such analysis.",2024-10-05
@Always Bullish LUV has to overhaul their entire computer systems and the dangers of problems of such an overhaul far outweighs the activism pump and dump schemes IMHO,2024-10-05
@El Rainmaker I agree will be very interesting to watch.. my home airport they do very little traffic… so not sure i can fly them that much more but i will try.,2024-09-30
@Valuestocks007 I suppose their internal polling reflects your sentiment. We will see how things end up in a couple years.,2024-09-30
"@Valuestocks007 before I would automatically pick them for travel. Now I will probably shop around based on price. If they are the cheapest I’ll fly them. If not, I’ll pass",2024-09-29
Airlines are never a good safely sleep at night core holding. They have high labor costs and high infrastructure costs having to replace super expensive airplanes on an ongoing basis and deal with fuel costs and just when they try and raise their fees their competitor lowers their fees. It’s a vicious cycle that never ends.,2024-09-28
"Elliott wins as long as Southwest clutches to an old and tired strategy that is out of line with low cost industry practices.  Elliott has to present a competing CEO candidate that will have organizational credibility and be able to innovate Southwest to the next level.  Merely ousting Jordan would be a mistake.Southwest's insistence that ""bags fly free"" means that at top level price comparisons, unknowing travelers wont know about the policy and will chose a competitor that will then charge for bags.Southwest needs to have a more premium product, including food and drinks, just as Spirit is doing on order to capture a potion of that segment from the big-3, while the big-3 looks for more basic economy opportunities. I still believe that Ryanair is ""best-in-class"" for low cost operations and Southwest needs to learn from them how to innovate and compete in a modern environment.",2024-09-27
"@Logan Kane Again, I do not like fare comparisons because they are very complex, but let me tell you about your BA observation.I was just following your comment, ""United pilots here in Texas are having trouble getting work– also they're selling tickets to London for $600"", but you want to go to BA, which was not part of your original comment.  OK, but here are the full numbers for a discounted period in October..On BA, you can get a cheap round trip on selected dates for $774 in basic Economy (similar time line and weekend requirements), you have to pay $974 for a discounted economy and $11,428 for business and $20,828 for first class.  That hypothetical business guy on less favorable business dates would be paying $1,991 BE, $2,191 DE and $12,678 for B.  Still nothing unusual in the relationships nor a flag that United is about o suffer a financial decline.",2024-09-26
