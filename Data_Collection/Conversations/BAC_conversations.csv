"@Orangejulius Yeah, goal seems to be under 10% so they don’t have to worry about reporting and regulations.$BAC will be fine and absorb a lot of the shares with $25 billion buyback.",2024-10-05
"@ocbearclaw It would make no difference what rate they charge as they would still have the issue of people being unable to pay it off.  Banks and any lending institution need to make money as well and there are too many people out here that ""just need to have the big screen TV,"" because it is more important than maybe buying food and then when the bill comes, they make the minimum payment, oh and they all need cellphones.  I have not paid interest on a charge card for 40 plus years.  Maybe a little restraint in usage would help, remember you can go and borrow money from a bank and pay the 8-10%.. You see there are alternatives",2024-10-05
"I think the banks should charge whatever interest rates they want, BUT when the interest rates are like 20% a year, it’s a black hole that nobody can pay back.. I’ve seen family and friends just give up and BK because the black hole is too big. Maybe they should at least ponder lowering the rates so the consumer could actually have a chance to repay their debt, it might help them in the long run",2024-10-05
It would have been better if it is explained how it is going to benefit the consumers and the bank.,2024-10-04

Excellent analysis. Thank you. Own it since 2008 in single digits but getting ready to ring the register on at least half and put in the BRK.B!,2024-10-03
"You'll probably see them sell until they're just below 10% of shares outstanding. It appears they're tired of complying with the requirements for that ownership level.That has been suggested in a few articles, and I'm inclined to agree by the pace of selling slowing down.",2024-10-03

"Friends, just a few observations, so please don't troll. : )Buffett is arguably one of the world's finest financial engineers. Berkshire's portfolio has a proven track record of withstanding the pressures of inflation, so it stands to reason that  with the undertow of deflationary forces at work, lower interest rates and higher corporate taxes, the portfolio construct is going to be fine tuned with one or more major defensive investments that will be taken private at a substantial premium, (in order to reduce future tax costs). Moreover, it makes a great deal of sense to take profits on investments that are less likely to contribute to the synergies of this well oiled financial machine and pay the lower capital gains tax now, as opposed to higher taxes later. Hence, the reduction in holdings of $AAPL, $BAC, $CVX, $TMUS, $FND, $COE, $PARA and $SNOW to name a few.  This window will be open for a relatively short period of time, and IMHO, this approach makes perfect sense. From a sector based camera angle of the publicly traded portfolio, Buffet is reducing exposure to telecommunications to a little over 2% of the portfolio post several sales, a slight divestment in consumer discretionary to 1%, information technology now 31% of the portfolio (post $AAPL divestment), energy with a slight reduction of CVX to 12.9%, and finally, the most important part of the machine following multiple $BAC sales and a recent a 21% reduction in $COE, is now 35.66% of the public portfolio.That said, I very much believe in Buffett's analogy of the batter waiting for the perfect pitch before swinging. A market rout would deliver the pitch he's waiting for. Considering that October is, historically speaking, one of the worst months in the year to trade, and even worse in an election year, this is a data point that adds a little color. Further to the above, the current backdrop of what is unquestionably the most overvalued market in the world, paired with worldwide geopolitical tensions and war, and what will likely be a contested election devolving into a constitutional crises or worse, very well could provide excellent opportunities to acquire great companies at attractive multiples. Examples include $HEI.A and $ULTA at the smaller end of the scale.  Energy has been a consistent theme, but there's no reason to rush in on $OXY or $CVX in a deflationary environment.  What makes overwhelming sense if $CB, which is hugely undervalued IMHO.Consider the metrics, Enterprise value of $139B vs a market cap of $117B. a forward PE of 13 and a price to cash flow of just 7 and change.  The play that makes the most sense is an all or nothing 'take it private' styled form of acquisition.  This approach is tax efficient from a total cost of ownership perspective, and would greatly enhance the cash flows of Berkshire.  I hope that these musings make sense and are helpful to the community. Cheers!",2024-09-28

"@CatchingFIRE A. The U.S. budgeting process is terribly broken. My consistent suggestion to address this issue is to end baseline budgeting. For example, all the money budgeted to address COVID remained in the baseline after COVID was no longer an issue. Why?We need to get to a zero-based budgeting approach, which may have been the only positive thing ever attempted by President Carter.B. You say, ""....my understanding is that trickle-down economics has been pretty thoroughly discredited."" No, it hasn't been. It fact, pretty much the opposite is true. (BTW,  I don't refer to it as ""trickle down,"" which is a pejorative characterization, but rather as ""flow through."") Federal revenues DOUBLED during the Reagan presidency, despite lower tax rates. The problem was lack of spending discipline. That lack of discipline was only reined in during the late 1990's, as a result of the passage of the Balanced Budget Act. The result, as you probably know, was a budget surplus for a year or two. Alas, both parties allowed the act to lapse in the early 2000's, primarily in response to 9/11.",2024-09-27
@BTB9192 Hope you are right. For now he is the value destroyer in chief as far as BAC is concerned. Despite a 27 Billion $ buyback it has lost 10% off the peak.,2024-09-26
"@Tyler Durden 42 Marquette ruling details the legal mechanics of Marquette are about as dry as it gets. The case involved two banks: Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis, where the state's usury law capped interest rates for loans at 12 percent; and the First National Bank of Omaha in Nebraska, where the state laws allowed an interest rate of up to 18 percent. To make up for the low cap in Minnesota, banks in Minnesota could charge an annual fee, which they did. But then, First National Bank of Omaha started marketing its no-annual-fee credit cards to Minnesota residents.Seeing itself at a disadvantage, Marquette sued, charging that the Omaha bank was violating Minnesota's usury law. The Supreme Court ruled, essentially, that state usury laws don't apply to nationally chartered banks based in other states. Plus, nationally chartered banks can ""export"" the interest rates allowed in their own states to customers throughout the country.The ruling made a sweeping interpretation of the National Bank Act, a law passed by Congress in 1864 as the United States was three years into the Civil War and in desperate need of financing for the Union's war effort. Until then, banks were only chartered by states. The National Bank Act created a way for the federal government to charter its own banks, which could issue bank notes backed by government bonds.The Smiley case sets stage for high fees The Marquette ruling also set the stage for another landmark Supreme Court decision regarding the credit card industry, Smiley vs. Citibank. In that case, a California woman, Barbara Smiley, had filed a class action lawsuit against Citibank's South Dakota-based credit card division, claiming that the $15 late fee she was charged on her credit card bill violated California state law. Citibank responded that the late fee was, in effect, interest and was covered under the National Bank Act. The Supreme Court agreed; the result was an increase of late fees and other fees from $10 or $15 to the $39 fee that credit card customers may see today.Michael Donovan, one of the attorneys who argued the Smiley case before the Supreme Court, says that the pair of decisions ""probably caused terrific abuses in the credit card market. Because they both created such ambiguity as to what law would regulate credit card lending, it was unclear for many, many years who had primary regulatory authority over credit offered in interstate transactions. ... It probably stunted the growth of an honest credit card market for over 20 years."" The result, he says, were the kinds of ""tricks and traps based on legal gimmickry"" that led to the Credit CARD Act of 2009 and the Wall Street reform law that included a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Both of those federal laws are designed to protect consumers -- but don't expect either of them to change the industry practices protected under the Marquette and Smiley decisions.Since the laws were set by the Supreme Court A President cannot overcome such usury laws by executive order and as such the laws governing. Many credit-card companies can still charge annual fees for their use, but basically is a way to circumvent any so-called usury rules.",2024-09-26

"@jonesdl261 ""You see credit card users should be responsible.""As should lenders.  In fact, the homeowners/borrowers in 2007/08 who helped bring the world economy to it's knees lost almost everything.  The lenders in 2007/08 who helped bring the world economy to it's knees got bailed out.Sure borrower has a choice, but there are usury laws in place but for some reason credit card companies are exempt.  I argue that they shouldn't be exempt.I would also argue that high interest payments are a net negative for the economy.",2024-09-26
