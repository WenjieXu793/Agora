"@pro8 Thanks for contributing to the discussion. And for everyone, I would remind you that UVE buys reinsurance to cover itself when extreme events, such as this one occur. While reinsurance won't necessarily cover all its (potential) losses, it should blunt the financial impact significantly.",2024-10-02
I highly doubt this has a big financial effect on UVE ... the hurricane as far as Florida goes hit the panhandle  area ... the stock price may drop .. of course we could get more storms as this is  close to the peak season still but I doubt this moves the needle that much financially for UVE as of this time...,2024-10-01
"@Bargain Buyer Yes, and I wrote this earlier below that NOAA predicted this. I think $UVE is headed back to $15-16 levels very soon.",2024-10-01
"UVE investors alert: Hurricane Helene was no joke, so be careful with your shares! Estimates suggest that Helene could cost up to tens of billions of dollars, and we don't know how much UVE is going to lose!Be careful, the story has changed.",2024-09-30
@willoace NOAA predicts above-normal 2024 Atlantic hurricane season.So we need to be careful. 2+ months to go and I think the stock is headed back to $17-18 levels soon.,2024-09-12
"If this hurricane season is anything short of catastrophic, this company is going to print money. I believe this company and stock still has a lot of runway. Long.",2024-09-11
