"Why not in the Americas? eBay fees used to be pretty reasonable when they were flat listing amounts. Now that it's percentage-based, you can really get reamed when you sell something",2024-10-01

@pace306 the more you post the higher it goes!! BEEN THE CASE FOR MONTHS NOW) i LOVE MY EBAY PROFITS.,2024-09-26
"""On Seeking Alpha, analyst Alan Galecki noted recently that the bull thesis is on shaky ground. ""eBay's stock has seen a strong uptrend since the separation with PayPal in mid-2015, mainly due to aggressive buybacks. However, its user base is crumbling,"" he warned.""%10000000 correct.All eBay does is CPC and advertising - selling takes a backseat.eBay stock (true value) is worth $35 a share since its NOT growing, its user base is shrinking, sellers are leaving, theres been a large increased amount of fakes and reproductions on the site and much more.The CEO said he had MAGICAL INNOVATIONS - watch him pull a rabbit out of his hat next.",2024-09-26
fwiw...ebay/spy pair has gone from 2 sigma cheap in february to near 2 sigma rich now (1yr horizon)... appears to headed for 3 year high set in february 2023.. on absolute basis 10/22/21 close of 80.59 is target,2024-09-24
"@Jason Z hey Jason, on p. 16 of the last 10–Q they show sales by region, but not profits.I tend to believe that indeed the US business does generate more profits, but I have no evidence as they don't break it down.",2024-09-23
"@Alan Galecki do they break out profits based on region? I would imagine the US account for much more than 50% of the profits. The big money is in the US, it's extremely difficult to make money in international operations, the competition is often too fierce which result in margin pressure.I would imagine that's the reason they sold some of their international business.",2024-09-22
"@UpsideDownsideAnalyzer agreed, at least in the US ebay has a near monopoly on the non-local online 2nd hand market. It might not be growing much, but it's not in decline neither, pretty far from a melting ice cube when it's making plenty of cash.",2024-09-17
"@UpsideDownsideAnalyzer I think it depends.eBay has a strong international (non-US) sales base. so one needs to look further than domestically.here in Europe (I also need to look beyond our borders), there are many more specialized and competing offerings for pre-owned stuff. eBay is by no means a monopoly on that front. regarding AMZN, I primarily wanted to highlight the difference in market values, not saying that they're directly competing which I haven't said this way.here in Germany on eBay, you're rather finding much B2C selling of stuff.what counts in the end is the user base which has been meting away. I totally agree that a smaller base is not automatically the nail in the coffin, but it makes growth harder to achieve.taken this into account, a ~20x multiple is too lofty.",2024-09-16
"@Bertrand Hochwald fb marketplace is a chaotic jungle even compared to ebay , just my observation. ebay much easier to use. fb marketplace is better for local pickup items.",2024-09-14
"@UpsideDownsideAnalyzer I am a long-time eBay buyer and seller, and use it as a first place to check for a cheap price.  My college-age daughters, however, think otherwise.  They use eBay only at my insistence, and none of their friends think of it as a first place to do their shopping.  I believe that the eBay user base is aging, and eBay is being replaced by Facebook marketplace and other reselling venues.  Facebook does not charge 13% (effective cost) of final cost like eBay does.I was a long-time shareholder, since early 2000's and sold during the pandemic run-up to $80.  I have been looking for a chance to get back into the stock as ""deep value"" but it seems to have run away from me from the mid-30's.  In any case, it's currently a cigar-butt type of company, and needs to reinvent its user base and its user interface (it's very clunky).  It should work hard to not alienate its sellers with high costs and poor customer service.  Try getting a live eBay representative as a seller and you will see what I mean, it's very difficult.",2024-09-13
@UpsideDownsideAnalyzer agreed comparisons between eBay and Amazon are not applicable anymore.  eBay will likely continue to grow and expand doing what they've learned to do best.  I do agree with the author regarding the current price.  I'd wait for a pullback here to add or initiate a position.,2024-09-13
"You are clearly not a teenage high school girl, because if you were, you would be buying clothing on eBay.  Peter Lynch also was not a teenage girl. eBay has the largest available inventory of pre-owned merchandise, Amazon is predominantly new merchandise, and media, and AWS. So comparing eBay to Amazon is like comparing Apples to Lemons. So long as there is a market for used merchandise, eBay has a very long road ahead and is the dominant player by far in second hand merchandise. eBay also sells a massive amount of used cars and trucks and boats, etc. That market is enormous. I see eBay continuing to be the quintessential toll booth for buying and selling second hand merchandise, and that market is only growing. The BigLots recent bankruptcy and bankruptcy of Sears and Kmart and many others shows eBay’s resilience.",2024-09-13
"@wolverine1987 - you are right that eBay stock continues to go up - but then again ""no one ever bets against the housing market, right ?""Whatever/whomever is protecting eBay - is unknown to me - but it IS happening.eBay isnt measured the same way other companies are - and no one can explain why.eBay sent out a hit team to try and kill/hurt people and the stock didnt change (imagine if the CEO of Coke sent a hit squad to kill or hurt the head of Pepsi)eBays numbers continue to drop, yet it has no effect on their stock.eBays CEO said he would fix eBay with ""magical innovations"" (like a chlds birthday party) and WS (who always claims its SERIOUS about business) just laughed ....SO yes - you are right - only god knows why eBays stock continues to rise  (it must be that 27 cent per share dividend!)",2024-09-13
"@pace306 25% increase since your post, and the stock barely went down during the two sharp drawdowns we had in August and last week. Your derisive post isn't aging well at all",2024-09-12
