"Unum has been an excellent long term holding for me and shows no signs of it not continuing to move higher, particularly as interest rates drop. I started building a position in Unum in September 2020, and added to it in 2021, 2022 and 2023, with a total cost basis of just under $28. It is now among my larger positions in the dividend income allocation of my portfolio. It has a very low Beta (a giant plus) and is now 1.6% of my portfolio and I will continue to hold it into the interest rate declines that are expected over the next year.",2024-10-04
"It is true the valuation is modest. I bought UNM earlier this year, collected a little dividend and sold at a profit. It was a good ride. I like the stability of the stock price--seems to have ""low beta."" You can make money with this stock, it is a decent company... probably best to find the right entry point though.Just right now, the share price seems a little bit high to me, and interest rates getting cut doesn't tend to be favorable for insurance companies, so I steer clear. I think UNM could be vulnerable to a big market pullback from insurance companies. What they call ""sector rotation."" It may come later on in 2025...just food for thought.",2024-09-22
This article makes no sense. The author admits UNM is likely to grow profits  8-10% long term.  It trades at a PE below 7.  And therefore it has little or no appeal for long term investors?  WTF?  I am not buying as I loaded up at even more absurdly low valuations during the pandemic.  But if you were too distracted to miss out on the 26 months of firesale close out prices on UNM during COVID it still rates as an excellent long term investment right here.  It's priced for ZERO growth and yet is expected to grow 8-10 percent per year over the next couple of years and long term. HELLO!,2024-09-21
"I am a huge fan of UNM. It is my second largest position in my entire portfolio (all individual stocks). BUT, BUT BUT, how did folks miss the incredible long period that this stock was insanely cheap. What were you doing? I accumulated all throughout the COVID years. I ended up with 3310 shares at average cost per share of $26.87 per share.I could understand a value investor missing the sale on UNM if it only had the COVID flash crash and had quickly recovered but that is NOT/NOT what happened. The reality is that UNM was under $30 for ALL of 2020, ALL of 2021 and the first months of 2022, so like from the beginning of COVID and then for another 26 months or so. You literally had 26 months to partake in the sale.If you are just starting investing and taking a look now at UNM, okay, that makes sense. But if you are a long time value investor, wow.I think it is very likely that I will be making similar statements about the incredible sale that has existed on BTI these last years in a couple of years.",2024-09-20

"@Gentleman Argentum Not immediately, but over time, yes. P&C insurers are more exposed as they have 3-5 year maturities, so as bonds mature, they reinvest at lower yields. Unum has much of its portfolio 10+ years, so it takes much longer for changes in rates to shift income. Plus with just a 4.45% yield, it can still reinvest at higher yields today in corporate debt even with rates having fallen.",2024-09-19
"Don't insurance companies lose interest income when rates fall? I do not think it is a coincidence UNM fell after the .5. You may forgive my rudimentary understanding of insurance companies, but my impression is they love high rate environments.",2024-09-19
