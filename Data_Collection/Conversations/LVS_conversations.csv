Somebody buying LVS stock today.   Nice little pop.,2024-09-24
@Stricktuo they have a lot of cash and Macao is profitable.,2024-09-24
Sing a pour is going to be a home run for LVS.,2024-09-16
@Stricktuo You may just get another casino like Singapore in the near future. Keep an eye on the Thailand possibilities,2024-09-14
"@Florida_Dreaming Of course. I once had a large position but sold out in the $80 area. Adelson’s (sp?) passing and the uncertainty afterward was the biggest factor but I did not like the terms when the lease was renegotiated nor did I like the remodel cost so soon after completion. It’s just my opinion of course but when I factor in the geo political concerns and heavy involvement of the Chinese, it doesn’t seem like the good bet it was. The Chinese don’t seem to like anything they can’t control or own the majority stake in. Macau does not seem to be the profit center once envisioned  and the sale of the Vegas property was done for the same reason imo.  But I’ll keep watching it. Another casino like Singapore would change my opinion.",2024-09-14
@Stricktuo You realize their entire business is over there correct?  It's Las Vegas Sands but 100% of their business is either in Macau or Singapore.,2024-09-13
@Stricktuo one possible theory is they believe the shares are cheap and have confidence in the future. They also increased their stake at end of 2023,2024-09-13
One has to wonder why LVS  would increase their stake in an area where the government is stiflingly predominate in their business.,2024-09-13
Would be nice to get a dividend increase soon as the pre-Covid trend was annually.  Help soften the disappointing stock price decline over the past year plus.,2024-09-13
