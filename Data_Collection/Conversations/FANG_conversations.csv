"@billygoatsgruff Yes, thought a similar thing. Current price is almost $181... so a lot of room left to climb till $182 ;)  Something must be wrong here, either the buy rating or the price target.",2024-10-02
"Wow!  JP Morgan thinks it will go up 3% from here, what a call, those millions in analyst salaries...so worth it!",2024-10-02
"Despite the false narrative of trump and the republicans, as I have been writing on Seeking Alpha for a few years now: we live in a ""New Age of Energy Abundance"" and the U.S. is energy independent (by an estimated ~3 million boe/d) and is the #1 petroleum producer on the planet and the #1 LNG exporter on the planet. This is one reason the XLE Energy ETF is one of the worst performing sector ETFs over the past decade (if not the worst ...) and if it wasn't for Putin & Netanyahu's wars, the results would have been even worst, and likely significantly so. Meantime, note the American ""big-3"" (Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips) aren't making any significant investments in wind, solar, and battery backup capacity. As a result, they are increasingly ill-prepared for the 21st Century of electrification and they are increasingly contributing to global warming, and we saw the results of that with the horrific recent hurricane that laid waste to so much of the Southeastern U.S. and took more than 100 lives.There is no way the planet will stop burning up as long as the ""Big-3"" (little 3?) refused to invest some of their cash-flow directly into renewables. Further, the supposed ""carbon sequestration"" is a total disaster, ineffective, and waste of time, money, and resources. What a world!",2024-10-02
@Josef Wackerl  looks like a buying opportunity for management to me. Otherwise just another day in the world of O&G stock ownership. If a long no need to worry imo,2024-09-27
"@Josef Wackerl On the other hand, Diamondback has a long history of lowering costs.  Had Endeavor been at the top of its game, that would not be a possibility and Diamondback would be looking elsewhere.So yes, Endeavor is happy to get rid of the assets because it has higher operating costs.  But Diamondback has long been the better operator in these deals and has long created value for shareholders by doing these deals.  I like Diamondbacks chances.",2024-09-26
"Any comments on today's stock price move? More than $11 down. Ok, I know, oil price is falling. But that is not the whole story. I read, that an insider (manager of Endeavour) sold nearly all his shares. Maybe he just doesn't want to be part of the new united company. Or maybe something bad is coming?",2024-09-26
Good job on the balance sheet and explaining cash flow strength. Would have loved an oil price sensitivity chart demonstrating strength of hedges,2024-09-25
"@georgefelix75 Earlier this month, I sold the Jan 2025 $190.31 PUT for $32.  My assign price would be $158.32.  If it just expires, I will have earned 15% (annualized) on the $15,832 of cash the Put tied up. Think a bit before selling FANG options, the strikes get reduced by the variable dividend (~$1.56 a quarter), good for Puts, use cautions with Calls.",2024-09-24
Anyone have comment on selling Jan 2025 $200 covered calls and selling the same expiry $180 puts? $14 combined premium.,2024-09-24
"@Long Player Yeah, I remember. those days very well.   As Charlie Munger recommended, I backed up the truck to the pie wagon and bought aggressively.  I still have Targa purchased at $6, MPC at $16.50, and many others.  Buying when there is blood in the street does not happen that often, but I have been investing for fifty years and I've been handed four great opportunities.  Covid was very kind to me.  Walking the talk gets easier with age, experience, and confidence.I am a little surprised that there is so little love for CVE.  I recently added 500 shares at $16.40 and 10 Jan 2026 $10 calls.  Once again, thanks for the review.",2024-09-23
@R Phillips In 2020 this reached $20 per share.  I retired the first time and put my money in the stock market.  That got my IRA off to a good start to say the least.,2024-09-22
Any dilution is the subject of the acquisition....not the secondary offering where the opposite happened.,2024-09-22
"Imo it's only dilution if it does not add equal value, given the history of this company so far I expect it to add more than equal value to the company. I also expect with the drop in share price the company will be using the variable dividend pool to buy shares back this quarter if it still could.",2024-09-22
"@lithops In theory even the issuing 10% new share to executives every year needn’t be value dilutive if the executives actually add that much value or if they would have been paid that much in cash otherwise.  Those are very, very rebuttable presumptions though!",2024-09-22
"@houtex Yes, there's certainly a big difference between dilution like this, and a tech company issuing 10% new shares to its executives every year.  And REIT issuances seem a lot different too.",2024-09-22
@lithops Different people have different definitions of “dilution” as you highlight. I really wish people would add a word to help clarify. Ownership dilution doesn’t mean value dilution or EPS dilution or CFPS dilution etc. I blame WallStreetBets. That’s where I first saw this focus on “they issued shares it’s dilution!”.  Corporations and finance professionals don’t care about the number of shares. They care about the value each of those shares.,2024-09-22
"Certainly seems like a good acquisition.  However, dilution refers to the original shareholders having a lower percentage share of a company after a stock issuance, so it has occurred here whether or not earnings and cash flow per share increase.",2024-09-22
"I purchased Rattler during the covid fiasco in April of 2020, and two years later  it was  acquired by Diamondback.  FANG has appreciated more than 300% and  has generated an excellent yield at cost.  Thanks LP for keeping me to date.",2024-09-22
"@pberen FANG gave Endeavor owners shares and cash in exchange for the Endeavor. Now those former owners are selling a chunk of their FANG stock, a portion of which FANG is buying. The rest is sold to other investors.",2024-09-20
"@americawestcmh Yeap that is what I have been doing, and investing Muni-bonds AA and AAA. I'm too old to take the risk that I used to.",2024-09-20
