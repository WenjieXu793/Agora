@Passive Income Investor Only MSFT. All other tech cos I have are not dividend payers.,2024-10-03
@Lorem Ipsum DSA Which ones do you own in the Tech space that are dividend growers? Thx.,2024-10-03
"@Rooney McAroni Very disappointing indeed!Financially they most definitely can increase the div, which makes no sense to me why they did not.I wish I could ask the board... no new members in 2024, the last one was Thomas French in mid 2023.I will not sell my position, as nothing changed fundamentally at this company, on the contrary the future seems to be quite rosy.Good investing.",2024-10-03
"@Passive Income Investor If you want to know what I think, the best way to invest is to find a great business first. That alone will be responsible for most of your returns. Valuation will be responsible for a smaller part of your returns - the part that represents a difference between the multiples at which you buy the stock and those at which you sell it.Once you found a great company that's not stupidly overpriced, then and only then look at their dividend policy / buybacks.But I do not know of a specific stock to replace GLW with. The ones I would replace it with, I already own anyway.",2024-10-02
"@Lorem Ipsum DSA Where would you put your money to better use in the Tech sector? I am a Dividend Growth Investor as well and am not happy that GLW broke their streak. I am long GLW too but would switch to a better alternative that prioritizes the dividend growth. I am considering switching either to HPE, HPQ or to CSCO, but just can't make up my mind. My horizon is long-term / forever and only prefer to keep stocks that keep their dividend growing and aren't paying <2% dividend and there aren't that many options like that in the Tech sector especially since I already own KLAC and BR - two stocks that do have a lower yield already and I also own TXN.",2024-10-02
"@Rooney McAroni Looks like they severely de-prioritized the dividend. I'd be OK with it if they ramped up buybacks, but I do not see that happening. No shareholder yield from a stalwart - money starts looking for a better home. I am long, but looks like not for long.",2024-10-02
"So that is a broken streak then.$0.28 times 4 paid this year, as well as last year.",2024-10-02
"Very Walmartesque... Oh wait, even Walmart raised it by a penny every year.",2024-10-02
"You're welcome, @Robert F. Abbott , and thanks for acknowledging my work.  I had put in the time and effort right after 2Q earnings came out and when the 2Q 10-Q was released.  I also thought it curious that the dividend wasn't raised, so I tried to figure out why.  I'm just sharing here what I learned back then.  I prefer to compare distributions to shareholders against FCF, rather than earnings.  With thanks and best wishes, DB Bob",2024-09-30
"@Robert F. Abbott I'm just back from ""vacation"", so only now seeing your write-up.  Although management hasn't addressed the question of ""why no dividend increase?"" that I'm aware of, the reasoning behind it is clear, in my opinion.  Corning's Free Cash Flow doesn't support their current level of payments to shareholders.  The Springboard framework *might* improve that scenario, so we'll see about the future.  Samsung (a significant Corning shareholder) has a deal with Corning where -- at Samsung's discretion -- they can sell shares at fixed times and prices (see the recent 10-Q for some level of detail).  Corning can buy those shares or allow Samsung to sell them in the open market (and Corning may have to pay ""make whole"" amounts, but probably not at today's GLW share price).  In Q2, management talked about feeling comfortable with the Springboard framework and buying shares as a result.  But they made no open market purchases in Q2 -- the only shares purchased were those put up for sale by Samsung.  They talked about share repurchases continuing in Q3.  I'm guessing that Samsung has indicated to Corning that they will continue selling shares.  As I said, that's a guess, but we'll know for sure when the 3Q 10-Q comes out in a month or so.  But the second quarter 10-Q makes it clear that all the repurchased shares came from Samsung, and that Free Cash Flow < Dividends + Share Repurchases.  It's not clear how long that will last, but that's how it stands today.  There is some seasonality to Corning's cash flows.  But I'll also point out that their first-half CapEx spending was below the amount that the CFO has stated is their ""maintenance CapEx"" level.  It seems clear to me that they're feeling pinched, making it tough to ""find that penny"".  The deal with Samsung that I mentioned has several more years to run.  Once the deal ends, Samsung has less constraint on selling their remaining shares.",2024-09-30
"@Robert F. Abbott    I believe they will do just that  before 2025 gets here. You covered them well, now we have to wait and see if what they expect going forward actually happens.    Vince",2024-09-18
"@jvincen2 Thanks for pointing that out, Vince. It is odd the board could not find an extra penny per share to keep its dividend growth going for a 14th consecutive year. Unless it finds that penny in the second half, it will have to start over to become a Dividend Aristocrat.",2024-09-18
"A raise in the dividend to keep an annual streak going  was due in February, didn't happen.  VinceLong term holder but that may change going forward.",2024-09-18
"@Chris Lau APP, PEGA, and GPN, in that order, seem really interesting.  TY!",2024-09-13
"@optimismbalanced - I don't have insight into that particular angle, but as I wrote in the piece, the investment thesis for GLW is strong. Also, consider the stock has outperformed the S&P500 by 4%+ just since this piece was published on Aug 14th. Not bad.",2024-09-11
@RealRural QQQJ maybe?  Index fund though and newer so performance isn't that impressive yet.,2024-09-10
"@Pingili I'm not saying but today. in fact, I'm adding to bonds at this moment. but I have 4 off this list and will add as I deem appropriate. ddog I got for $80 and will add more shares at some point.",2024-09-10
"Good ideas and theory on this press release, but way too much research for this ancient investor. Anyone have recommendations if there is/are mid-cap tech ETFs or CEFs to look at? I'd be happy to get decent performance with diversified tech risk from a mid cap fund.",2024-09-10
"I actually see quite a few solid companies here with share prices that should appreciate considerably, if not immediately. Some names I don't recognize and a few I find questionable but overall not a bad list to generate some ideas for further research.Mid-caps are something my portfolio needs desparately and I would like to open ~5 positions in a few new stocks over the coming weeks (usually 1/4th to 1/3rd the size of what I consider a full position). I'd like at least 3 to be mid-caps. I'm really eyeing TER, but my portfolio is already considerably overweight in the semiconductor industry.",2024-09-10
