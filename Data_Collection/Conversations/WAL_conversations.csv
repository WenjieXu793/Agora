I just found this article while searching for a reason why WAL stock price was up today.  I agree with ttfizzle that I love this stock for the surprise it gave me.  It has been popular in the BetterInvesting community for several years and the group couldn't understand why it was getting included in the mid-size bank scrum a year ago in March.  I owned it and my investment club had a position in it.  In January 2023 I sold my position at a slight loss because I thought it was overvalued.  As the price started to decline in winter 2023 I watched while others in my group were building a position.  On the morning of March 13th 2023 I took a leap of faith and placed a market order for 100 shares to have skin in the game. Wonder of wonders it was filled at below $10 a share.  I have continued to hold and follow the stock and have added to my position ever since.,2024-09-20
"THanks for the write-up. I just love that this stock continues to surprise on the upside all the time. I bought it at $24 per share, thinking it was undervalued; I was wrong; it was severely undervalued. Now I think it trades at the market from here. But 2% pop today. yeah.",2024-09-13
"@2021investor Lower Mortgage rates will lead to refinancing at lower rates, devaluing mortgages via higher CPR, and leading to lower interest components. If you think service fees will salvage the lost value, then go ahead. The only thing going for banks in a declining-rate environment is 1) IBD, and 2) Lower funding cost + higher credit spread on loan book, but credit event risk is usually higher when rates first start dropping, so, that's why you're seeing banks reduce duration on loans (lower returns), I use $MS as an example.",2024-09-13

"@MileHighMoney30 It's both. ""The market"" is a lot of different people doing different things. Sometimes the things they do has a common theme. However, news articles talk about ""the market"" as if it's one individual. Trying to understand the psychology of ""the market"" is like trying to understand what direction an army of ants will scatter. Depending on the environment, incentives, and stimulus, it can be all sorts of things.Some people are expecting 25bps, others are expecting 50bps, some changed their minds given X or Y news. On balance, the net change is reflected in the market. Zoomed out, it looks ""random"" to a series of economists and other academics. When it finally happens next week, the immediate result will be corrected towards what actually happens. But the overall long-term result ""should"" be that the economy improves with rate cuts, depending on how severe the economy was damaged with the rate hikes.That's my take at least from a random guy on the internet.",2024-09-11
@MileHighMoney30 Rate cuts are good for banks looking to grow their loan books.,2024-09-11
"Im confused, I thought a larger rate cut meant the economy was struggling more than we would like but now a smaller rate cut is bad? Which is it?!",2024-09-11
This is the start of possibly a very dramatic easing cycle so hardly bad news for Banks as credit becomes more widely available and as there be no shortage of Government need to borrow let alone all of the massive industries currently running flat out to meet demand and still hardly immaterial inflation even Banks should make money here.

Banks were down previously because a 50 bsp cut was on the table. Letâ€™s pick whatever nonsense headline fits our narrative today. NII is the story this week with JPM cooling expectations. This has overshadowed banks who made positive remarks and reaffirmed guidance. Place your bets accordingly.,2024-09-11
