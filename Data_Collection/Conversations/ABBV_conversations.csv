"My money is on BMY. ABBV has done a great job, but I believe BMY will establish itself before ABBV reaches the market. And if there is an improvement it will likely be marginal.",2024-10-04
Keep chugging along ABBV! Pay down that debt.. and keep raising our dividends!,2024-10-04
@kevn1111 I kinda agree but:1. It is expected and anyone that knows the company should be able to kinda anticipate it.2. I’m not sure but I suspect there is some serious degree of uncertainty to the occurrence for the milestone expenses.  If they accounted for all upcoming in their guidance but the realization rate is only like 10% they may seriously undershoot on guidance.,2024-10-03
"Another qtr, same thing.  It is never in the forward guide.  Is silly how they do it.  You can take guide and lower by a bit for future IPR&D.    So this is no biggie.",2024-10-03

"@ndardick Hello, glad to see you around again. Thank you for reading and the comment. On Emraclidine, as commented in the article, I am supporting my opinion on the clinical trial results released as per today. In that clinical trial Emraclidine showed a stronger reduction of the PANSS score when compared against the baseline and placebo than Cobenfy, while showing a similar AEs profile than Cobenfy. HOWEVER, the big caveat is that Emraclidine’s Phase II results, which are expected in Q4 2024, will be key to really understand the therapeutic potential of this M4-selective PAM in Schizophrenia. In terms of time line, as commented in the article, even in the most optimistic case (good Phase II results, and BLA submission at some point between late 2025 and early 2026), Emraclidine is still 2-3 years away from being commercial. Obviously, all might change is the Phase II clinical trial yield poor results. In terms of which is a better bargain at the moment, when considering the current share price and growth potential, I would totally agree with you on BMY having an advantage. Given that Cobenfy won’t have direct competitors within the next 2-3 years, at least, I think BMY investors are going to see Cobenfy’s positive impact much faster than expected. However, long term Cobenfy might need to share the market with Emraclidine. On the other hand, ABBV and BMY have both demonstrated that their growth portfolios are de-risking the impact of their LOEs. So, in my opinion both companies are fantastic investment opportunities, with relative low risk for being in the biopharmaceutical business. In any case, thank you again for sharing your thoughts, and have a good investing.",2024-10-03
"You seem highly confident of the future approval and success of ABBV's drug to address schizophrenia when you say:""Although Cobenfy has the first-mover advantage, I believe Emraclidine’s positive clinical results and high efficiency on the reduction of Schizophrenia’s symptoms (achieving a larger reduction of the PANSS score than Cobenfy), and reduced side effect profile, might support Emraclidine’s claim to be best in-class (see image below) muscarinic treatment against Schizophrenia.""""I don't know the timeline for ABBV's phase trials, potential approval, manufacturing and distribution, but for now I am betting on the Cobenfy product from BMY that has already received full FDA approval and will be ready for sales and distribution before the end of this month. Beside, I would much prefer to buy a stock with a p/e of 10 (BMY) that a stock with a p/e of 65. Especially since BMY also offers a dividend yield that is about 50% higher than ABBV. For these reasons, I not only bought a full position in BMY but also sold my position in ABBV because of pressure from insurance companies and Medicare to force users of Humira to switch to generics and bio-similars.",2024-10-03
fwiw... abbv/spy pair trading near fair value (3yr horizon) was 2 sigma rich in january 2023 and 2.5 sigma cheap in october 2021,2024-10-02
I have doubled my $ on ABBV. It has been one of my best purchases and I will hold it from now on. One of the points made in the article was that they are spending more on R&D. Of course they should. These companies are transforming the world.,2024-10-02
"In Q3 2023, ANIP filed an NDA for an undisclosed drug and the submission fee was paid for by an undisclosed partner. There is a good possibility that it might be for the first FDA approved female testosterone drug. AbbVie's Dr. Michael C. Snabes was the study director for the testosterone studies. If the NDA relates to female testosterone, AbbVie may the partner and investor considering selling, may want to hold off until the FDA make a decision on ANIP's NDA and the partner is disclosed  The PDUFA date was never provided, however if the FDA is still on schedule for the review, a decision should come out shortly. FYI, during the 3,656 participant long term safety/efficacy study, partway through the study, with 4,000 patient years of data collected, they found that restoring testosterone in postmenopausal women at risk of having cardiovascular event reduced CV events by at least 70% and reduced breast cancer events by an undisclosed percentage. Though the study treated HSDD, secondary outcomes remain unknown, therefore the indications in their filing remain unknown.",2024-09-30
