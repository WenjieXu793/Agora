"@Searching Thoughtfully So I just read the press release.  Wow.  Stealing candy from a baby comes to mind??  Or maybe when something seems too good to be true, it probably is??  Based on the press release, this was comically good for GoHealth.1) Paid $5 million cash, but get it back as part of the assets you paid to acquire, plus $13 million more in cash on the balance sheet, and $100 million in contract assets.  Maybe the quality of those assets is questionable?2) It does not mention if e-TeleQuote has debts it will also be assuming?   3) GoHealth gets a trained workforce of licenses agents - 400 or so of them - just before the annual enrollment period.  If GoHealth were to try and add that many agents from scratch, the cost in dollars and time of onboarding them would surely be close to $5 million in and of itself (if the exact number is 400, investing $5 million in the hiring / training process would be $12,500 per agent; maybe 3 months or so worth of salary and benefits per agent if I had to guess?  Not counting the internal costs of training in time, materials, etc.)  And assuming these agents are experienced, they could be more productive than newbies.  All in all, $5 million seems like a cheap roll of the dice for GoHealth here - high upside potential, limited downside, unless there's something ugly lurking underneath the surface?",2024-10-02
@Larry Saunders The terms of the deal were published yesterday and you can look at the 8K and Press Release.  GOCO was paid to take e-TeleQuote. Hard to imagine that this is anything but a fabulous deal if you believe in the GOCO business model.  Your thoughts?,2024-10-02
