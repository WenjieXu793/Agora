@csmclemore @magichr Thanks for sharing. Do you think AMZN needs to tie-up with a healthcare specialist to make it work? Combine its logistics focus with the knowledgable customer care that comes from a company in that field?,2024-10-06
"@obiwan48 @Minor Enthusiast Relative to the S&P500, I don't see WBA showing a lot of buyers.To buy anything, since I need it to beat the S&P500, it doesn't interest me yet.",2024-10-06
"@csmclemore Yeah, hard to figure exactly with the public info we have, but there is no way it doesn't add to the bottom line.  If it even stabilizes their earnings (forget growth), we will see a higher PE multiple, and the stock goes up.  I’m ready to be patient.",2024-10-05
"@MWinMD I was being facetious. I took a crack at figuring it out about a month ago based on everything publicly reported and $1 billion annually was my estimate. Could be a little more or a little less, there is some uncertainty.",2024-10-05
"@csmclemore Ha.  I hope you’re being facetious!  I’ll take that extra dollar per share in EPS, especially at these price levels!Seriously, have you seen an estimate of what they hope to gain in EPS from the closings?",2024-10-05
@Richfool  Even earning beat this stock will go to maybe $10 or 11..,2024-10-05
"@magichr but tech companies like Amazon are always successful at their efforts to disrupt the healthcare system, just like… ummmmm",2024-10-04
"@MWinMD I mean, closing the 25% of stores that are unprofitable will only add like $1 billion to net profits annually, what else ya got!?",2024-10-04
"@Minor Enthusiast except a whole broken industry.I am baffled by the ""whole industry is in trouble but Walgreens will somehow beat out CVS and prevail by closing a quarter of the stores"" talk. The furniture burning is an attempt not to sink further into quicksand; it isn't a magic tree of free cash flow growth and margin expansion.",2024-10-04
"@Hunting Alpha --How do you compare the online channels of CVS vs Walgreens?--I do not buy from them online much, but the CVS website seems more advanced.",2024-10-04
@MWinMD  spot on.That will be happening…Wentworth estimated 25% of total stores to be closed over next 36 months.,2024-10-04
Sure there’s a catalyst:  closing all the money-losing stores.,2024-10-04
"Ya guys amazons pharmacy is going to put Walgreens and CVS out of business. 89% 1 star. They are basically losing 89% of their customers after they try it out. My neighbor used them for a few months quickly went back to walgreens saying the prices are almost the same, but using amazon pharmacy was a nightmare www.trustpilot.com/... Here is a review from 3 days ago on trust pilot for amazon Delayed by 20 days and never arrivedDelayed by 20 days and never arrived. Had to transfer it out",2024-10-04
"@Hunting Alpha They have 1.4 review on trust pilot for amazon. This is a pharmacist response about amazons pharmacy. I'm a pharmacist. Recommendation: don't bother with AmazonI have been a pharmacist for nearly 50 years and I have to say this: Amazon does not know how to run an efficient pharmacy operation. The GOOD: If you are on routine monthly meds (BP meds, thyroid meds, cholesterol meds, etc) it works fine usually. The BAD: If your doctor orders something you might need for mild pain or flight anxiety be prepared to wait for 10-14 days while the pharmacist talks to the prescriber and does a big ""clinical review"". The UGLY: ""customer care"" is no more than lipstick on the pig who politely does nothing about your problem. Talk to a pharmacist? I did a couple of times, ""Pharmacist to Pharmacist"". The result: a complete waste of my time. A clinical review should take no more than a couple of hours, maybe a day max. Not at Amazon. Bottom line: go somewhere else.",2024-10-04
@bambootiger42  Sure you are. My neighbor used amazon for a few months dealing with nightmare delivery situations and went right back to walgreens cause its basically the same price and prefers getting meds sooner rather then later and likes knowing its a legit pharmacist who will deliver their meds within an hr.,2024-10-04
"Just about every low volume day, is driven by shorts and/ or institutional day traders. Currently, they’ve been running up to 9.30+/- then taking back down to 8.55 ish ( with a couple of moves higher or lower). They’ve done this “ trade” at least 3 times in the past few weeks.I doubt WBA will towards the low side of this channel as we head into the day or twobefore Quarterly results. Real danger for shorts if good guidance.All of this trading is near term. Wentwort will be successful…but have to be patient.",2024-10-04
"With the exception of significant news on WBA, whereby the stock has larger volume days, the vast majority of the down days are being driven by shorts coupled withlarge institutional day traders ( that are playing the channel trade).Many shorts, just about every day, are using sophisticated option trading strategies that is dovetailing the pressure on WBA. Just watch the volumes on the $10-17.50 call strikes on any given day and it will telegraph which way they are likely to take it over the next few days.Large shorts have done this relentlessly from 27ish down to current price range.And they have done exceedingly well.While accurate as to the reasons why a  historical price plunge occurred,investors understand it-in other words, that horse is dead. However, expect The shorts to keep flogging it… But, as we enter the first quarter, and subsequently reach further into 2025, it’s going to be a case of “musical chairs” or “hot potato” as Wentworth’s locks in traction and various catalysts kick in on his restructuring.While everything has gone ( in many cases justifiably) wrong, via negative news, etc.presently the downside risk is much lower, with upside much higher.For the shorts in 2025, I believe they’re going to playing a game of musical chairs or hot potato. In the meantime, like Ali, I plan to play “ Rope a Dope” and let the shorts keep hammeringaway at 9,8,, etc…I’m loading the boat now and will continue to do so.Writing covered calls to mitigate downside and provide 5-10% interest on money deployed. I feel by 2027 it will be a large gain from current levels, although I do expectthat only 1-2 quarters more may be problematic as Wentworth’s team works out of the mess he took over.Expect major positive news by end of 1st Quarter 2025.Long WBA and adding.",2024-10-04
@real estate 101 I sold at 16 bought back yesterday.   I think an earnings surprise on the 15th will be a catalyst to get back to double digits.,2024-10-04
@Hunting Alpha Walgreens works with door dash and does 1 hr delivery. What other company can match that?,2024-10-04
@PennyPlanSupporter in short it’s all about PBMs all the rest is noise. If the pharmacy business gets better pricing along with PBM pressure then they win. If not they will need to pivot. WBA is already aggressively downsizing preparing for the worse which is very smart. At the same time working with PBMs. Risk free? Of course not.I have worked in distressed for years and yes there is a blueprint but it can’t always be replicated. If I had a concern here it’s not the model but the  board. GE succeeded because he was on the board of you did not know. He already had buy in. I can go on and on but amazon target bla bla bla is not the problem,2024-10-03
